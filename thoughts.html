<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>This page contains my thoughts on various technical topics. Some could probably be expanded into whole blog posts. We'll see if I ever get there.</p>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<h3>Before We Begin...</h3>

<p>Before I start giving opinions on programming languages, I want to start
by stating that a programming language is simply a tool. In the hands of a
master, almost any language can be used effectively. While some languages are
more appropriate for certain scenarios, there are always larger issues, such
as the understanding and competenence of those surrounding you.</p>

<h3>PHP</h3>

<i>Last updated 2011-05-12</i>

<p>PHP was one of the first programming languages I used on personal projects
(as opposed to classroom work). At the time I learned and used it, I only
really knew C++. And, coming from C++, PHP was just easier to use. And, when
you are a student and want to get things done fast, the choice is easy.</p>

<p>In my PHP days, I wrote a mountain of blog posts about PHP. I was excited
about PHP 5 over PHP 4 because it meant increasing the liklihood of better
organized code through OO. At the time (and I believe it is still the case),
many PHP programs were glorified shell scripts. They include other files
haphazzardly. They don't have a unified API or library design. They just felt
hacked up. I always tried to be a "good" PHP programmer by
utilizing classes, implementing tests through PHPUnit, making source code
readable, etc.</p>

<p>After learning other scripting languages (like Perl and Python), I quickly
abandoned PHP in favor of them. They offer everything PHP does (and more) and
they do it better. About the only thing PHP has/had going for it was its
ubuiquity. You could run a PHP program nearly everywhere. But in the corporate
world, where I had my own servers, I could do anything I wanted.</p>

<p>My gripes about PHP will likely echo others':</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monolithic global namespace. There's a couple thousand functions in there!
    And, they are often all available all the time. It's no wonder why there are
    so few PHP interpreters out there.</li>
  <li>Library community (PEAR) stinks. It can't touch CPAN or even PyPI.</li>
  <li>Haphazzard versioning. Point releases would often include major version
    bumps on bundled packages (like PCRE). Gah!</li>
  <li>Many security problems. It is one thing for poorly-written PHP applications
    to have security vulnerabilities. It is another for the core language
    releases to be plagued by security vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>HTTP server integration. Back when the Apache HTTP Server ruled the
    world, everybody and his sister ran Apache+mod_php. However, you could
    hardly do any deep integration with the HTTP server internals from within
    PHP. And, it appears you still can't (for better or worse). I often found
    myself needing features that only mod_perl or mod_python could provide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<i>Last updated 2011-05-12</i>

<p>I first ran into Perl when I was very young and my father thought I might
enjoy learning how to program. He gave me a print out of a free book on how
to learn Perl. My mind could not grok it at the time, so I moved on.</p>

<p>My next encounter with Perl was at an internship in 2006 at Tellme Networks,
where it was used extensively. I learned beginner Perl during the internship.
And, when I started full-time in early 2007, I picked it up slowly over the
course of a year. Of course, any time someone says they learn Perl, what they
really mean is "they learned how to use Perl in the way that others at the
organization use Perl." I was fortunate that "Tellme Perl" was very readable:
lots of modules (as opposed to scripts), lots of tests, usage of Perl::Critic,
and strict and warnings were used everywhere. Best of all, there were a lot of
great Perl programmers and they loved imparting their knowledge via code
reviews and demonstrations.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of Perl is CPAN. Hands down the best library collection
of any programming language. I hate reinventing the wheel. And with CPAN, you
often don't need to. Excellent resource. Other likes of Perl include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Concise regular expressions. I know, "now you have two problems." But,
    they get the job done with a little amount of code.</li>
  <li>Features spectrum. Want to access low-level C functions and use them
    almost directly? Yeah, you can do that. Want the benefits of a dynamic
    language with reference counting, memory management, etc. You can do that
    too. Not many (if any) languages give you such a wide variety of low- and
    high-level functions from which to use.</li>
  <li>Documentation. The man pages are excellent. You have to learn which
    pages have what. But, they answer most debates authoritatively.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I have technical gripes about Perl:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html">pre-defined
    variables</a>. They contribute to a bulk of Perl's line noise. I almost
    always used the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/English.html">English</a>
    module to increase readability.</li>
  <li><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html#Context">Variable context.</a>
    This has got to be one of the most confusing features of any programming
    language ever conceived. Each variable has a distinct type (scalars, arrays,
    and hashes). However, some types have different meaning depending on how
    the variable is accessed. For example, an array is sometimes an array. But,
    if accessed like a scalar, it is actually the length of the array. Huh?
    Cool feature, but confusing beyond belief.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lua</h3>

<i>Last updated 2011-05-14</i>

<p>Lua is my favorite embeddable programming language. I fancy the language
because it is small, extremely fast (<a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>
can rival C/C++), and is minimal.</p>

<p>I often find myself using Lua in C or C++ programs to accomplish tasks
that I don't want to code in C or C++. I can write things in a higher-level
language without dealing with the complexities of C/C++. Or, if I want the
ability to run user-supplied code, Lua is often where I turn to facilitate
that. I can create more than 100,000 Lua contexts per second on a modern CPU
and each context consumes just a few kB of memory, so it scales very well.
And, each context is locked down by default and there are hooks to limit
allocations and CPU usage, so it is pretty easy to keep in check, even when
running user-supplied code.</p>

<p>Lua isn't perfect (no language is). My gripes typically echo that of the
larger community. But, for what it is, it is amazing and I love working with
it.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<i>Last updated 2011-05-14</i>

<p>Python is currently my favorite dynamic/scripting language. You can do
almost everything in Python. The syntax is highly readable. It has a great
set of libraries available. The community is active. Performance is decent.
The source code and manual is peppered with Monty Python references. There's
very little about Python that I don't like.</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h3>Erlang</h3>

<h3>Cassandra</h3>

<i>Last updated 2011-05-12</i>

<p>Where do I begin with Cassandra? I dated Cassandra for a few months at Xobni,
where she served as the sole data storage layer for Xobni Cloud, a cloud-based
service for storing email, contact, and personal interaction data. She seemed
to get the job done, but it was really rough.</p>

<p>When I first started, Xobni was running Cassandra 0.6.2 or 0.6.3 in EC2
utilizing the ephemeral (built-in) storage on instances (as opposed to EBS).
Every time any sort of workload was incurred, disk I/O would spike through the
roof and we'd see I/O queue and wait times reach alarming values. Furthermore,
processes would OOM frequently.</p>

<p>Over time, we made application improvements to reduce I/O, learned how to
tune the JVM, applied Cassandra settings that were appropriate for us, etc.
But, every time we made an improvement, Cassandra hit us with a new curveball
that left us scratching our heads. It felt as if we were constantly "leveling
up" to achieve the title of Cassandra Zen Master, only to have Cassandra fight
back every step of the way.</p>

<p>My latest experience with Cassandra was with 0.6.13. If someone were to ask,
I would probably recommend not using it. The reasons are explained in the
following paragraphs.</p>

<p>My chief complaint against Cassandra stems from complications due to
memory management. Cassandra blows through a JVM heap like you wouldn't believe.
I once <a href="http://cassandra-user-incubator-apache-org.3065146.n2.nabble.com/Nodes-frozen-in-GC-td6092805i20.html#a6159468">witnessed</a>
Cassandra allocating around 4GB/s! At that rate, you will incur many
stop-the-world garbage collections (at least with the Sun/Oracle JVM). This
can cause peer nodes to mark the paused node as down, which disrupts cluster
efficiency. And, if two nodes in the same replication range pause at the same
time (at least with replication factor 3), there goes your availability.</p>

<p>While we're speaking of memory management, I don't care for Cassandra's
treatment of memory within a garbage-collected language/environment (Java/JVM).
There are many parts of Cassandra that iterate over massive amounts of data
(via file handles), read the data to an in-memory buffer, do something with it,
and disregard the buffer, leaving it up to the JVM to GC it. This leads to
rapid heap exhaustion and frequent garbage collections. It would be much better
if Cassandra just allocated a single large buffer and reused it. Yes, you incur
the memory allocation overhead, but you've probably already done that anyway by
defining a fixed JVM heap size. And, I'll trade a little hardware resources for
a more consistent system almost always.</p>
