  <h1>HTTP</h1>
<h2>Common Resources</h2>
<p>RFC 2616 is the definitive resource for HTTP/1.1. The IETF currently has
a working group, Httpbis, who has a charter to revise and clarify RFC
2616. Their documents (currently drafts) will eventually replace RFC
2616. The drafts have gone through numerous revisions and I now look to
them when looking for clarification.</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC 2616 <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTML</a>
  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">text</a></li>
<li>Httpbis <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/">drafts</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3>Don't Trust HTTP Stacks</h3>
<p>I've learned to not trust HTTP implementations. Writing a proper HTTP
stack is hard. Making it conform to all the corner cases is even harder.</p>
<p>When dealing with load balancers and proxies, I tend to avoid performing
HTTP until absolutely necessary. In other words, put load balancers in
TCP mode and don't have them talk HTTP. I trust a network appliance's
ability to speak TCP more than HTTP.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<h3>Improper Status Code Usage</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes I see people make with HTTP is improper
usage of status codes. I attribute most of the mistakes to people
reading the simple text description of the status code and not
specification. This naive approach leads to completely wrong usage of
codes like 406 Not Acceptable, which is used in relationship to the
Accept- series of headers and has nothing to do with the <em>general</em>
acceptability of a particular request.</p>
<h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>
<h3>Conditional Requests</h3>
<p>HTTP provides a mechanism whereby you can perform conditional requests.
Effectively the client says "I know X and Y about this resource: only
retrieve if it is different." This is a very powerful construct. Proper
understanding of conditional requests can mean the difference between
effortless scalability and a costly hardware or software build-out.</p>
<h4>Weak and Strong Validators</h4>
<p>Validators are means by which content/resources are compared. They come
in two flavors: weak and strong.</p>
<p>Weak validators are typically cheaper to create and compare compared to
strong validators. However, they aren't as effective.</p>
<p>Strong validators have the rule that they must change to a new,
previously unused or guaranteed unique value whenever a change occurs to
the representation data such that a change would be observable in the
payload body of a 200 response to a GET. Two resources cannot share the
same validator unless the paylad body would be identical. Strong
validators should also be unique over all representations over all time.</p>
<p>An example of a weak validator is a time. You could take the time a file
or record was last modified and use that as a validator. An example of a
strong validator is the SHA-2 of a file.</p>
<p>Many people use hashes for strong validators. This is a good way to
ensure the uniqueness requirements for strong validators, as the
probability of hash collisions (assuming a proper algorithm) is
extremely small.</p>
<p>The general rule is to use stong validators if you can. Strong
guarantees are better than weak guarantees, after all. However, pay
careful attention to how you are calculating the validators. Calculation
could be expensive, possibly too expensive for your needs. You may be
tempted to cache these strong validators. Be careful: can you guarantee
the cache will <em>always</em> be updated if the underlying resource changes?
If not, you will likely encounter bugs.</p>
<p>That being said, weak validators have their use. For example, you may
want to force a conditional request based on resource age alone. Here,
weak validators are perfectly fine.</p>
<p>It is common to use a date and time as a validator. These validators are
typically weak, but they can be strong if some conditions are met. Read
the spec for the crazy rules.</p>
<p>Dates work great as cheap validators under most circumstances. However,
they don't work too well if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources are updated multiple times per second</li>
<li>Times aren't always consistent (e.g. multiple nodes serving from local
  filesystems behind a non-deterministic load balancer)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ETag header holds the validator for a particular representation. It
is an opaque quoated string. If it is prefixed with <em>W/</em>, the validator
is weak. Otherwise it is strong.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all rule for validator
generation. If you are serving files off a filesystem, the HTTP server
will typically use mtime as a weak validator and MD5, SHA-1, etc of the
file's contents as a strong validator. Unfortunately, the ETag header is
sent at the top of the response, so the value must be calculated before
the response body is sent on the wire. If the server were dynamically
calculating file hashes, it would have to choose between reading a file
once from I/O and buffering to memory or performing 1 read pass to
calculate the hash and another to send the file over the wire. The real
answer is to use a modern filesystem like ZFS where file hashes are
stored as part of the file metadata and are updated automagically.
However, most HTTP servers don't have these kinds of deep hooks to save
work. In the end, you know your own application the best, so you know
how to most effeciently implement validator generation.</p>
<h3>Partial Content</h3>
<p>Servers can return partial responses for resources.</p>
<p>Request has Range header. Could also have If-Range to make conditional.
Response contains Content-Range OR <em>Content-Type: multipart/byteranges</em>
with Content-Range for <em>each</em> part. Response must also contain Date and
{Cache-Control, ETag, Expires, Content-Location, Last-Modified, Vary} if
a non-range request would have resulted in a 200 and contained these.</p>
<p>Response code is 206 on success or 416 on failure.</p>
<p>Clients can request multiple ranges. There are all kinds of crazy rules
around this. Read the spec.</p>
<h3>Representation Transformation</h3>
<p>It is possible for intermediary agents to transform responses. If they
do, they are supposed to return 203 for originally 200 responses. If the
original response wasn't 200, they should use the Warning header with
the 214 code. I <em>think</em> they are supposed to retain the original
response code at that point, but I'm not clear.</p>
<p>Representation transformation can be controlled by Cache-Control
no-transform.</p>
<p>In the wild, many intermediary agents transform content without doing
the right thing.</p>
<p>Not many stacks seem to have support for this. If writing an HTTP
service, I would not rely on HTTP transformation unless you have total
confidence in all HTTP stacks. In other words, only use this if you are
a business deploying a private application on your network. If an open
source project, you don't know what others' stacks will look like, so
avoid relying on this.</p>
<h2>Status Codes</h2>
<h3>100 Continue</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.1.1">2616</a>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3">usage</a></p>
<p>Often used as part of look-before-you-leap conditional POSTs or PUTs
dealing with large payloads. Can be in response to any HTTP method,
however.</p>
<p>HTTP request must have <em>Expect: 100-continue</em> header.</p>
<p>Some stacks (like parts of .NET) utilize conditional POST or PUT
automatically. Many (most?) HTTP server stacks intercept <em>Expect:
100-continue</em> requests <strong>before</strong> they hit the application layer. Apache
is an example.</p>
<p>These responses can be sent <em>after</em> the server has seen part of the
request. This may confuse poorly written HTTP stacks with strict state
machines.</p>
<p>Some clients (can't remember which) send conditional requests but don't
wait for this response.</p>
<p>If server sends 100 Continue, it must eventually send a final response.</p>
<h3>101 Switching Protocols</h3>
<p>Used if request contains Upgrade header. Part of switching the protocol
of the TCP channel. Has nothing to do with application-level protocols.</p>
<h3>200 OK</h3>
<p>Most common response code. It is almost always safe to send this. Fall
back to this status code if nothing else makes sense.</p>
<h3>201 Created</h3>
<p>Request resulted in new resource being created. Often used as response
to PUT to a resource-centric URI.</p>
<p>Response's Location header contains URI for best representation of the
created resource. This is typically the URI for the request.</p>
<p>Response body contains resource characteristics and location(s). Media
type of response can be anything.</p>
<p>Resource must be created (and available) before server returns. If not,
use 202.</p>
<h3>202 Accepted</h3>
<p>Used for deferred processing. Server sends when it has received
something but hasn't acted on it.</p>
<p>Response body should contain pointers so client can query processing
state.</p>
<p>I've used this for job processing. Set up a bunch of workers processing
jobs. Set up HTTP server. When client submits work, server assigns
unique ID to job, saves it to a queue, then returns a 202 with metadata
describing job and a URI to query for job state. Client then comes back
later and queries job status URI to see if the job has finished. If not,
the client typically waits and polls again. If it has, the client moves
on, likely doing something with processed data.</p>
<h3>203 Non-Authoritative</h3>
<p>For 200's that have been modified by an intermediary agent. See section
about representation transformations for more.</p>
<h3>204 No Content</h3>
<p>Like a 200 but with no response body and special semantics. If server
wishes to convey information about request, that is done in headers.</p>
<p>If you communicate any additional information in custom headers, I think
it is best to use 200, 201, or 202 and send that as part of the response
body instead.</p>
<h3>205 Reset Content</h3>
<p>Mostly used for interactive user agents. Server effectively tells client
"I processed what you sent, reset your state and prepare to go again."</p>
<p>Contains no response body.</p>
<p>Most of the complexity here is in the client. I'm not sure what type of
client support there is for this code.</p>
<p>I've never seen this used in the wild. I would avoid it unless it
really, really makes sense.</p>
<h3>206 Partial Content</h3>
<p>Used in response to a partial content request. See the section on that.</p>
<h3>300 Multiple Choices</h3>
<p>The requested resource has multiple representations. Almost certainly
sent in response to a GET.</p>
<p>Response body contains representation of different choices. You should
contain URIs in this response.</p>
<p>If there is a <em>best</em> URI, that is sent in the Location header. Clients
are allowed to auto redirect if Location header is set. Watch out for
this trap! Not sure what popular agents do in practice.</p>
<p>When considering this status code, be sure you aren't reinventing
content negotiation. If you don't want to rely on content negotiation
and expose different media types at different URIs, this may come in
handy.</p>
<h3>301 Moved Permanently</h3>
<p>Requested resource has been moved permanently.</p>
<p>Only use this if you are absolutely sure you'll never want to reuse the
URI, as downstream agents may remember the permanent change and not ask
the server again if things have changed. You can theoretically control
this with caching headers, but don't rely on it.</p>
<p>New URI should be in Location header. It is valid to change the value of
the Location header if things change later on. But, be sure that the
original URI handed out by Location will also 3XX to new URI, or clients
could get lost.</p>
<h3>302 Found</h3>
<p>Resource temporarily at another URI.</p>
<p>This is an old HTTP 1.0 status code. Use one of the other 3XX codes if
possible.</p>
<p>This code is often used incorrectly as a result of a POST. The semantics
of this code are "that thing you requested is over here for the moment."
if you are looking for "I processed your request and the results are
here," use 303.</p>
<p>Agents are allowed to transparently convert from POST to GET when
receiving this code. Consider 307 instead.</p>
<h3>303 See Other</h3>
<p>Provides an indirect response to a request.</p>
<p>This should be used when processing POSTs and you want to return a
resource while maintaining URI purity. For example, if submitting form
data with POST, the server processes that request without issue and
wants to give the client a representation of the new state. The server
would issue a 303 with Location pointing to the URI representing the
result of the POST.</p>
<h3>304 Not Modified</h3>
<p>Sent in response to conditional requests and says the response has not
been modified.</p>
<h3>305 Use Proxy</h3>
<p>Deprecated in HTTP Bis drafts. Avoid this.</p>
<h3>306 (Unused)</h3>
<p>Been deprecated for a while. Don't use.</p>
<h3>307 Temporary Redirect</h3>
<p>Similar to 302 except different semantics. If writing a new service and
you don't need HTTP/1.0 compatbility, you can use this.</p>
<p>Agents may perform redirect automatically for safe methods, otherwise
agent is required to confirm redirect. That seems to imply that this
isn't suitable for automated agents??</p>
<h3>4xx Client Errors</h3>
<p>The 4xx class is for client errors. They are frequently misused because
people read the short name not the full description. Response bodies to
4xx should describe the error.</p>
<h3>400 Bad Request</h3>
<p>From the spec:</p>
<pre><code>The server cannot or will not process the request, due to a client
error (e.g., malformed syntax).
</code></pre>
<p>There is much contention over whether this applies strictly to the HTTP
protocol or whether it can be expanded to application-level as well.
Many have started using this to indicate general failures with the
request (e.g. missing a query string parameter).</p>
<p>In the ideal world, I think it would be OK to use this as a general
purpose, application-level "I couldn't process the request because the
client did something wrong, not me." In the real world, there are
practical concerns. For example, some HTTP stacks will close the TCP
connection when they see a 400 because they interpret 400 to mean the
HTTP bits over the wire couldn't be parsed and the processing state is
undefined. This is a completely valid concern! If you are an
intermediary HTTP agent, you have to effectively guess who is right.
Since you are allowed to close a persistent connection any time, many
stacks play it safe and do this.</p>
<p>If you find your high volume web service behind an intermediary agent
that closes connections after seeing a 400, you could be in a world of
hurt. All of a sudden requests take a few ms longer to establish the
socket. And then one day you get random 25s request times. You scratch
your head for a few minutes then realize you have thousands of sockets
in TIME_WAIT and you've exhausted your TCP socket pool because of many
short-lived requests.</p>
<p>I think HTTP stacks have been trending towards not closing connections
on 400. But, if you want to liberaly use 400, test on your
infrastructure first and be sure to continuously monitor things by
verifying new load balancer software updates, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, HTTP doesn't have a general purpose "there is something
generic wrong with the request" status code. So, you can take a (small?)
risk with 400's, use a more appropriate 4xx, or send a 200 with a media
type that reflects errors.</p>
<h3>401 Unauthorized</h3>
<p>The request requires some form of authentication to be performed.
Response contains WWW-Authenticate header. Client should then repeat
with a suitable Authorization header.</p>
<h3>402 Payment Required</h3>
<p>Reserved for future use. This was originally conceived to be used for
micropayments. Nothing official has manifested.</p>
<p>Some people have devised schemes utilizing this. Since nothing is
standardized, I recommend avoiding it to avoid nonconformance with
future specs.</p>
<h3>403 Forbidden</h3>
<p>Where 401 is <em>authentication failed</em> 403 can be thought of as
<em>authorization failed</em>. The credentials and everything else in the request
are valid, but they don't have access or aren't authorized to make the
request.</p>
<p>Note that 403's can leak data by identifying whether a resource exists.
For example, if user X attempts to access Y and receives a 403, they
know that Y exists. If you are concerned about this leakage, you are
allowed to return 404 even though 403 is more technically accurate.</p>
<h3>404 Not Found</h3>
<p>Nothing found at the requested URI. Condition could be temporary or
permanent. If permanent 410 is more appropriate.</p>
<p>This can also be used when the server doesn't want (or can't) reveal why
a request is refused or when no other response is applicable.</p>
<h3>405 Method Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Sent when the HTTP response method is not allowed for the current URI.
Response contains Allow header containing comma-delimited list of
methods supported. Most people forget the Allow header. It is required.</p>
<h3>406 Not Acceptable</h3>
<p>Requested content could not be delivered because the server wasn't able
to satisy the client's parameters given in Accept and Accept- headers.
In other words, if content negotiation yields nothing suitable, this is
returned.</p>
<p>Many people read <em>Not Acceptable</em> and think it means a generic
client-side error. This is wrong.</p>
<p>Response should contain details on what content is available so the
client can do something intelligent instead of giving up.</p>
<p>See the section on content negotiation.</p>
<h3>407 Proxy Authentication Required</h3>
<p>This is like a 401 but is used for proxy authentication.</p>
<h3>408 Request Timeout</h3>
<p>The request was not produced/read in the time the server was willing to
wait. Typically servers will send this automatically and applications
running on the server have very little control over it.</p>
<p>This typically only comes up when dealing with slow clients or very
large uploads.</p>
<h3>409 Conflict</h3>
<p>The request could not be performed because it would result in a resource
in a conflicted state. This is only allowed when the client might be
able to resolve the conflict and try again. If the conflict can't be
resolved, the spec says nothing on what should be used.</p>
<p>Since the client should be able to resolve the conflict, the response
should contain details to aid this.</p>
<h3>410 Gone</h3>
<p>This is like a permanent 404.</p>
<p>Intelligent clients can remember 410's and may never try to request that
URI again (because the condition is permanent). So, you shouldn't return
a 410 unless you are absolutely positively sure that URI won't be used
again. If you don't know, 404.</p>
<p>410's are useful to instruct others to remove references to them. For
example, when a search engine spider sees a 410, it will typically
deindex the page immediately, However, it may attempt to query a 404
again later.</p>
<h3>411 Length Required</h3>
<p>The server requires a Content-Length header on the request.</p>
<p>This would likely only occur when performing chunked transfer and the
server wants to ensure size restrictions <em>before</em> it starts processing
the request.</p>
<h3>412 Precondition Failed</h3>
<p>Sent when a precondition (If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since,
If-Unmodified-Since, If-Range) evaluated to false. What's happening is
client says "I'm asserting X and Y." Server says, "No, X isn't true,"
and sends a 412.</p>
<h3>413 Request Entity Too Large</h3>
<p>Known as <em>Request Representation Too Large</em> in HTTP Bis drafts.</p>
<p>The server refuses to process the request because it is too large.</p>
<p>This can be used to enforce size limits on posted entities.</p>
<p>The condition is allowed to be temporary and can be identifies as such
by using Retry-After.</p>
<h3>414 Request-URI Too Long</h3>
<p>Known as <em>URI Too Long</em> in HTTP Bis drafts.</p>
<p>Sent when the URI (the bit in the first line of the HTTP request) is too
long. HTTP servers typically do this automatically. Unless you are
implementing an HTTP server, you probably have no justification for
sending this.</p>
<p>While the HTTP spec doesn't define a length limit, most servers impose
one. It is hard-coded in some servers and configurable in others.</p>
<p>Anything over 1024 bytes is probably pushing the envelope. If you see
this error, you should probably be sending data via the HTTP request
body, not the URI.</p>
<h3>415 Unsupported Media Type</h3>
<p>The server can't understand the Content-Type of the request.</p>
<h3>416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable</h3>
<p>Returned when performing a range request and none of the requested
ranges could be fulfilled.</p>
<h3>417 Expectation Failed</h3>
<p>The client sent an Expect header and the server doesn't know how to
handle it.</p>
<h3>426 Upgrade Required</h3>
<p>The server is requesting that the client change the protocol on the
channel. The response contains an Upgrade header saying what to upgrade
to. After that, the client is supposed to follow typical upgrade
procedure.</p>
<p>This does <strong>not</strong> involve application-level upgrades. Instead, it is
telling the client to change the underlying protocol away from
HTTP/1.1 and to something else.</p>
<h3>500 Internal Server Error</h3>
<p>General server-side error code. If the server couldn't process the
request because of an error on its end, this should be sent.</p>
<p>Many HTTP handlers will send this out in the case of an uncaught
exception, other errors.</p>
<h3>501 Not Implemented</h3>
<p>Sent when the server does not support handling a request.</p>
<p>If I'm implementing an HTTP service, I use this for URIs whose
functionality I haven't coded yet.</p>
<h3>502 Bad Gateway</h3>
<p>An intermediary agent sends this when an error was encountered talking
to an upstream server.</p>
<h3>503 Service Unavailable</h3>
<p>Denotes a temporary condition where the server or service is unavailable
for whatever reason and can't or doesn't want to process a request.</p>
<p>Some servers send this automatically. Others will just not accept new
sockets.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to send a Retry-After header to tell clients when they
should try again. This can be used for backoff control. Of course, not
all clients heed the advice and try again immediately, so you can't rely
on it as a infallible failure mechanism.</p>
<h3>504 Gateway Timeout</h3>
<p>An intermediary agent timed out while waiting for a response from an
upstream server.</p>
<h3>505 HTTP Version Not Supported</h3>
<p>The protocol in the first line of the request message is not supported.
This is typically sent automatically by the server.</p>
