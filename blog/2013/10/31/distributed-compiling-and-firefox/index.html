  <p>If you had infinite CPU cores available and the Firefox build system
could distribute them all for concurrent compilation, Firefox
clobber build times would likely be 3-5 minutes instead of ~15
minutes on modern machines. This is a massive win. It therefore
should come as no surprise that distributed compiling is very
interesting to us.</p>
<p>Up until recently, the benefits of distributed compiling in the Firefox
build system couldn't be fully realized. This was because the build
system was performing recursive make traversal and make only <em>knew</em>
about a tiny subset of the tree's total C++ files at one time. For
example, when visiting <em>/layout/base</em> it only knew about 35 of the
close to 6000 files that get compiled as part of building Firefox. This
meant there was a hard ceiling to the max concurrency the build system
could achieve. This ceiling was often higher than the number of cores in
an individual machine, so it wasn't a huge issue for single machine
builds. But it did significantly limit the benefits of distributed
compiling. This all changed recently.</p>
<p><strong>As of a few weeks ago, the build system no longer encounters a low
ceiling preventing distributed compilation from reaping massive
benefits.</strong> If you have build with <em>make -j128</em>, make will spawn
128 compiler processes when processing the <em>compile</em> tier (which
is where most compilation occurs). If your compiler is set to a
distributed compiler, you will win.</p>
<p>So, what should you do about it?</p>
<p>I encourage people to set up distributed compilation <em>networks</em>
to reap the benefits of distributed compilation. Here are some tools you
should know about and some things to keep in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/distcc/">distcc</a> is the tried and proven tool
for performing distributed compilation. It's heavily used and gets the
job done. It even works on Windows and can perform remote processing,
which is a huge win for our tree, where preprocessing can be
computationally expensive because of excessive includes. But, it has
a few significant drawbacks. Read the next paragraph.</p>
<p>I'm personally more excited about
<a href="https://github.com/icecc/icecream">icecream</a>. It has some very
compelling advantages to distcc. It has a scheduler that can
intelligently distribute load between machines. It uses network
broadcast to discover the scheduler. So, you just start the client
daemon and if there is a scheduler on the local network, it's all
set up. Icecream transfers the compiler toolchain between nodes
so you are guaranteed to have consistent output. (With distcc,
output may not be idempotent if the nodes aren't homogenous since distcc
relies on the system-local toolchain. If different versions are
installed on different nodes, you are out of luck). Icecream also
supports cross-compiling. In theory, you can have Linux machines
building for OS X, 32-bit machines building for 64-bit, etc. This
is all very difficult (if not impossible) to do with distcc.
Unfortunately, icecream doesn't work on Windows and doesn't appear
to support server-side preprocessing. Although, I imagine
both could be made to work if someone put in the effort.</p>
<p>Distributed compilation is very network intensive. I haven't measured,
but I suspect Wi-Fi bandwidth and latency constraints might make it
prohibitive there. It certainly won't be good for Wi-Fi saturation!
<strong>If you are in a Mozilla office, please do not attempt to perform
distributed compilation over Wi-Fi!</strong> For the same reasons, distributed
compilation will likely not benefit you if you are attempting to compile
on network-distant nodes.</p>
<p>I have set up an icecream server in the Mozilla San Francisco office. If
you install the icecream client daemon (iceccd) on your machine, it
should just work. I'm not sure what broadcast nets are configured as,
but I've successfully had machines on the 7th floor discover it
automatically. I guarantee no SLA for this server. Ping me privately
if you have difficulty connecting.</p>
<p>I've started very preliminary talks with Mozilla IT about setting up
dedicated <em>compiler farms</em> in Mozilla offices. I'm not saying this is
coming any time soon. I feel this will have a major impact on developer
productivity and I wanted to get the ball rolling months in advance
so nobody can claim this is a fire drill.</p>
<p>For distributed compilation to work well, the build system really needs
to be aware of distributed compilation. For example, to yield the
benefits of distributed compilation with make, you need to pass -j64 or
some other large value for concurrency. However, this value would be
universal for <em>every</em> task in the build. There are still thousands of
processes that must run locally. Using -j64 on these local tasks could
cause memory exhaustion, I/O saturation, excessive context switching,
etc. But if you decrease the concurrency ceiling, you lose the benefits
of distributed compilation! The build system thus needs to be taught
when distributed compilation is available and what tasks can be made
concurrent so it can intelligently adjust the -j concurrency limit at
run-time. This is why we have a higher-level build wrapper tool: <em>mach
build</em>. (This is another reason why people should be building through
mach instead of invoking make directly.)</p>
<p>No matter what technical solution we employ, I would like the build
system to automatically discover and use distributed compilation if
it is available. If we need to hardcode Mozilla IP addresses or
hostnames into the build system, I'm fine with that. I just don't want
developers not achieving much-faster build times because they are
ignorant. If you are in a physical location with distributed compilation
support, you should get that automatically: fast builds should not be
hard.</p>
<p>We can and should investigate distributed compilation as part of release
automation. Icecream should mitigate the concerns about build
reproducibility since the toolchain is transferred at build time.</p>
<p>I have had success getting Icecream to work with Linux builds. However,
OS X is problematic. Specifically, Icecream is unable to create the
build environment for distribution (likely modern OS X/Xcode
compatibility issue). Details are in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927952">bug 927952</a>.</p>
<p>Build peers have a lot on our plate this quarter and making distributed
compilation work well is not in our official goals. <strong>I would love, love,
love if someone could step up and be a hero to make distributed
compilation work better with the build system.</strong> If you are interested,
pop into #build on irc.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>In summary, there are massive developer productivity wins waiting to be
realized through distributed compiling. There is nobody tasked to work
on this officially. Although, I'd love it if there were. If you find
yourself setting up ad-hoc networks in offices, I'd <em>really</em> like to see
some kind of discovery in <em>mach</em>. If not, there will be people left
behind and that really stinks for those individuals. If you do any
work around distributed compiling, please have it tracked under
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=485559">bug 485559</a>.</p>
