  <p>As we look ahead to Q4 planning for the Firefox build system, I wanted
to take the time to reflect on what was accomplished in Q3 and to
simultaneously look forward to Q4 and beyond.</p>
<h2>2013 Q3 Build System Improvements</h2>
<p>There were notable improvements in the build system during the last
quarter.</p>
<p>The issues our <em>customers</em> care most about is speed. Here is a list of
accomplishments in that area:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>MOZ_PSEUDO_DERECURSE</em> work to change how make directory traversal
  works. This enabled the <em>binaries</em> make target, which can do no-op
  libxul-only builds in just a few seconds. Of all the changes that
  landed this quarter, this is the most impactful to local build
  times. This change also enables C++ compilation to scale out to
  as many cores as you have. Previously, the build system was
  <em>starved</em> in many parts of the tree when compiling C++. Mike Hommey
  is responsible for this work. I reviewed most of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WebIDL and IPDL bindings are now compiled in <em>unified</em> mode,
  reducing compile times and linker memory usage. Nathan Froyd wrote the
  code. I reviewed the patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XPIDL files are generated much more efficiently. This removed a
  few minutes of CPU core time from builds. I wrote these patches and
  Mike Hommey reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased reliance on install manifests to process file installs.
  They have drastically reduced the number of processes required to
  build by performing all actions inside Python processes as system
  calls and removing the clownshoes of having to delete parts of the
  object directory at the beginning of builds. When many mochitests
  were converted to manifests, no-op build times dropped by ~15%
  on my machine. Many people are responsible for this work. Mike Hommey
  wrote the original install code for packaging a few months ago. I
  built in manifest file support, support for symlinks, and made the
  code a bit more robust and faster. Mike Hommey reviewed these
  patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bugs and issues around dependency files on Windows have been
  discovered and fixed. These were a common source of clobbers.
  Mike Hommey found most of these, many during his work to make
  MOZ_PSEUDO_DERECURSE work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effort to reduce C++ include hell is resulting in significantly
  shorter incremental builds. While this effort is largely outside the
  build config module, it is worth mentioning. Ehsan Akhgari is leading
  this effort. He's been assisted by too many people to mention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The build system now has different build modes favoring faster
  building vs release build options depending on the environment. Mike
  Hommey wrote most (all?) of the patches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other non-speed related improvements have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The build system now monitors resource usage during builds and can
  graph the results. I wrote the code. Ted Mielczarek, Mike Hommey,
  and Mike Shal had reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for test manifests has been integrated with the build system.
  This enabled some build speed wins and is paving the road for better
  testing UX, such as the automagical <em>mach test</em> command, which will
  run the appropriate test suite automatically. Multiple people were
  involved in the work to integrate test manifests with the build
  system. I wrote the patches. But Ted Mielczarek got primary review.
  Joel Maher, Jeff Hammel, and Ms2ger provided excellent assistance
  during the design and implementation phase. The work around
  mochitest manifests likely wouldn't have happened this quarter if
  all of us weren't attending an A*Team work week in August.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are now in-tree build system docs. They are
  <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Build_Documentation/index.html">published automatically</a>.
  Efforts have been made to purge MDN of cruft. I am responsible for
  writing the code and most of the docs. Benjamin Smedberg and Mike Shal
  performed code reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements have been made to object directory detection in mach.
  This was commonly a barrier to some users using mach. I am responsible
  for the code. Nearly every peer has reviewed patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now require Python 2.7.3 to build, making our future Python 3
  compatibility story much easier while eliminating a large class
  of Python 2.7.2 and below bugs that we constantly found ourselves
  working around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mach bootstrap has grown many new features and should be more robust
  than ever. There are numerous contributors here, including many
  community members that have found and fixed bugs and have added
  support for additional distributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boilerplate from Makefile.in has disappeared. Mike Hommey is to
  thank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dumbmake integrated with mach. Resulted in friendlier build interface
  for a nice UX win. Code by Nick Alexander. I reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many variables have been ported from Makefile.in to moz.build. We
  started Q3 with support for 47 variables and now support 73. We
  started with 1226 Makefile.in and 1517 moz.build and currently
  have 941 Makefile.in and 1568 moz.build. Many people contributed to
  this work. Worth mentioning are Joey Armstrong, Mike Shal, Joshua
  Cranmer, and Ms2ger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many build actions are moving to Python packages. This enabled pymake
  <em>inlining</em> (faster builds) and is paving the road towards no .pyc
  files in the source directory. (pyc files commonly are the source of
  clobber headaches and make it difficult to efficiently perform builds
  on read-only filesystems.) I wrote most of the patches and Mike Shal
  and Mike Hommey reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>moz.build is now more strict about what it accepts. We check for
  missing files at config parse time rather than build time, causing
  errors to surface faster. Many people are responsible for this work.
  Mike Shal deserves kudos for work around C/C++ file validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mach has been added to the B2G repo. Jonathan Griffin and Andrew
  Halberstadt drove this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current status of the build bystem</h2>
<p>Q3 was a very significant quarter for the build system. For the first
time in years, we made fundamental changes to how the build system
goes about building. The moz.build work to free our build config from
the shackles of make files had enabled us to consume that data and do
new and novel things with it. This has enabled improvements in build
robustness and - most importantly - speed.</p>
<p>This is most evident with the MOZ_PSEUDO_DERECURSE work, which
effectively replaces how make traverses directories. The work there
has allowed Gecko developers focused on libxul to go from e.g. 50s
no-op build times to less than 5s. Combined with optimized building
of XPIDL, IPDL, and WebIDL files, processing of file installs via
manifests, and C++ header dependency reduction, and a host of other
changes, and we are finally turning a corner on build times! Much of
this work wouldn't have been possible without moz.build files providing
a whole world view of our build config.</p>
<p>The quarter wasn't all roses. Unfortunately, we also broke things. A lot.
The total number of required clobbers this quarter grew slightly from
38 in Q2 to 43 in Q3. Many of these clobbers were regressions from
supposed improvements to the build system. Too many of these
regressions were Windows/pymake only and surely would have been found
prior to landing if more build peers were actively building on Windows.
There are various reasons we aren't. We should strive to fix them so
more build development occurs on Windows and Windows users aren't
unfairly punished.</p>
<p>The other class of avoidable clobbers mostly revolves
around the theme that <em>the build system is complicated</em>, particularly
when it comes to integration with release automation. Build automation
has its build logic currently coded in Buildbot config files. This means
it's all but impossible for build peers to test and reproduce that build
environment and flow without time-intensive, stop-energy abundant
excessive try pushes or loading out build slaves. The RelEng effort
to extract this code from buildbot to mozharness can't come soon enough. See
<a href="/blog/2013/07/16/analysis-of-firefox%27s-build-automation/">my overview</a>
on how automation works for more.</p>
<p>This quarter, the sheriffs have been filing bugs whenever a clobber is
needed. This has surfaced clobber issues to build peers better and I
have no doubt their constant pestering caused clobber issues to be
resolved sooner. It's a terrific incentive for us to fix the build
system.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings on the personnel/contribution front in Q3. Kyle
Huey no longer participates in active build system development or patch
review. Ted Mielczarek is also starting to drift away from active coding
and review. Although, he does constantly provide knowledge and historical
context, so not all is lost. It is disappointing to see fantastic
people and contributors no longer actively participating on the coding
front. But, I understand the reasons behind it. Mozilla doesn't have a
build team with a common manager and decree (a mistake if you ask me).
Ted and Kyle are both insanely smart and talented and they work for
teams that have other important goals. They've put in their time (and
suffering). So I see why they've moved on.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Mike Hommey has been spending a lot more time on build
work. He was involved in many of the improvements listed above. Due to
review load and Mike's technical brilliance, I don't think many of our
accomplishments would have happened without him. If there is one
Mozillian who should be commended for build system work in Q3, it should
be Mike Hommey.</p>
<p>Q3 also saw the addition of new build peers. Mike Shal is now a full
build config module peer. Nick Alexander is now a peer of a submodule
covering just the Fennec build system. Aside from his regular patch
work, Mike Shal has been developing his review skills and
responsibilities. Without him, we would likely be drowning in review
requests and bug investigations due to the departures of Kyle and Ted.
Nick is already doing what I'd hope he'd do when put in charge of the
Fennec build system: looking at a proper build backend for Java (not
make) and Eclipse project generation. (I still can't believe many of
our Fennec developers code Java in vanilla text editors, not powerful
IDEs. If there is one language that would miss IDEs the most, I'd think
it would be Java. Anyway.)</p>
<p>There was a steady stream of contributions from people not in the build
config module. Joshua Cranmer has been keeping up with moz.build
conversions for comm-central. Nathan Froyd and Boris Zbarsky have helped
with all kinds of IDL work. Trevor Saunders has helped keep things
clean. Ms2ger has been eager to provide assistance through code and
reviews. Various community contributors have helped with moz.build
conversion patches and improvements to mach and the bootstrapper. Thank
you to everyone who contributed last quarter!</p>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the quarter, I didn't think it would be possible
to attain no-op build speeds with make as quickly as <em>make binaries</em> now
does. But, Mike Hommey worked some magic and this is now possible.
This was a game changer. The code he wrote can be applied to other
build actions. And, our other solutions involving moz.build files to
autogenerated make files seems to be working pretty well too.
This raises some interesting questions with regards to priortization.</p>
<p>Long term, we know we want to move away from make. It is old
and clumsy. It's easy to do things wrong. It doesn't scale to handle a
single DAG as large as our build system. The latter is particularly
important if we are to ever have a build system that doesn't require
clobbers periodically.</p>
<p>Up to this point we've prioritized work on moz.build conversion, with
the rationale being that it would more soon enable a clean break from
make and thus we'd arrive at drastically faster builds sooner. The assumption in that
argument was that drastically faster builds weren't attainable with
make. Between the directory traversal overhaul and the release of GNU
make 4.0 last week (which actually seems to work on Windows, making the
pymake slowness a non-issue), the importance of breaking away from make
now seems much less pressing.</p>
<p>While we would like to actively move off make, developments in the past
few weeks seem to say that we can reassess priorities. I believe that we
can drive down no-op builds with make to a time that satisfies many -
let's say under 10s to be conservative. Using clever tricks optimizing
for common developer workflows, we can probably get that under 5s
everywhere, including Windows (people only caring about libxul can
get 2.5s on mozilla-central today). This isn't the 250ms we could get
with Tup. But it's much better than 45s. If we got there, I don't think
many people would be complaining.</p>
<p>So, the big question for goals setting this quarter will be whether we
want to focus on a new build backend (likely Tup) or whether we should
continue with an emphasis on make. Now, a lot of the work involved
applies to both make and any other build backend. But, I have little
doubt it would be less overall work to support one build backend (make)
than two. On the other hand, we know we want to support multiple build
backends eventually. Why wait? In the balance are
<a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/build-system-goals">numerous other projects</a>
that have varying impact for developers and release automation. While
important in their own right, it is difficult to balance them against
build speed. While we could strive towards instantaneous builds, at some
point we'll hit <em>good enough</em> and the diminishing returns that accompany
them. There is already a small vocal faction advocating for Ninja
support, even though it would only decrease no-op libxul build times
from ~2.5s to 250ms. While a factor of 10x improvement, I think this is
dangerously close to diminishing returns territory and our time
investment would be better spent elsehwere. (Of course, once we can
support building libxul with Ninja, we could easily get it for Tup. And,
I believe Tup wins that tie.). Anyway, I'm sure it will be an
interesting discussion!</p>
<p>Whatever the future holds, it was a good quarter for the build system and
the future is looking brighter than ever. We have transitioned from a
maintain-and-react mode (which I understand has largely been the norm
since the dawn of Firefox) to a proactive and future-looking approach
that will satisfy the needs of Firefox and its developers for the next
ten years. All of this progress is even more impressive when you consider
that we still react to an aweful lot of fire drills and unwanted
maintenance!</p>
<p>The Firefox build system is improving. I'm as anxioux as you are to see
various milestones in terms of build speed and other features. But it's
hard work. Wish us luck. Please help out where you can.</p>
