  <p>Many developers use MacBook Pros for day-to-day Firefox development.
So, I thought it would be worthwhile to perform a comparison of
Firefox build times for various models of MacBook Pros.</p>
<h2>Test setup</h2>
<p>The numbers in this post are obtained from 3 generations of MacBook
Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A 2011 Sandy Bridge 4 core x 2.3 GHz with 8 GB RAM and an aftermarket
   SSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2012 Ivy Bridge retina with 4 core x 2.6 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and a
   factory SSD (or possibly flash storage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2013 Haswell retina with 4 core x 2.6 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and flash
   storage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All machines were running OS X 10.9 Mavericks and were using the
Xcode 5.0.1 toolchain (<em>Xcode 5 clang: Apple LLVM version 5.0
(clang-500.2.79) (based on LLVM 3.3svn)</em>) to build.</p>
<p>The power settings prevented machine sleep and machines were plugged
into A/C power during measuring. I did not use the machines while
obtaining measurements.</p>
<p>The 2012 and 2013 machines were very vanilla OS installs. However,
the 2011 machine was my primary work computer and may have had a
few background services running and may have been slower due to
normal wear and tear. The 2012 machine was a loaner machine from
IT and has an unknown history.</p>
<p>All data was obtained from mozilla-central revision d4a27d8eda28.</p>
<p>The mozconfig used contained:</p>
<p>export MOZ_PSEUDO_DERECURSE=1
  mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-firefox.noindex</p>
<p>Please note that the objdir name ends with <em>.noindex</em> to prevent Finder
from indexing build files.</p>
<p>I performed all tests multiple times and used the fastest time. I used
<em>time</em> command for obtaining measurements of wall, user, and system
time.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Configure Times</h3>
<p>The result of <em>mach configure</em> is as follows:</p>

<h3>Clobber build with populated ccache</h3>
<p><em>mach build</em> was performed after running <em>mach configure</em>. ccache was
enabled and the ccache was populated with the results of a prior build.
In theory, all compiler invocations should be serviced by ccache
entries.</p>
<p>This measure is a very crude way to measure how fast clobber builds
would be if compiler invocations were nearly instantaneous.</p>

<h3>No-op builds</h3>

<h3>binaries no-op</h3>
<p><em>mach build binaries</em> was performed on a fully built tree. This results
in nothing being executed. It's a way to test the overhead of the
<em>binaries</em> make target.</p>

<h3>binaries touch single .cpp</h3>
<p><em>mach build binaries</em> was performed on a fully built tree after touching
the file <em>netwerk/dns/nsHostResolver.cpp</em>. ccache was enabled but
cleared before running this test. This test simulates common C++
developer workflow of changing C++ and recompiling.</p>

<h3>Tier times</h3>
<p>The times of each build system <em>tier</em> were measured on the 2013 Haswell
MacBook Pro. These timings were obtained out of curiosity to help
isolate the impact of different parts of the build. ccache was not
enabled for these tests.</p>

<h2>Observations and conclusions</h2>
<p>The data speaks for itself: <strong>the 2013 Haswell MacBook Pro is
significantly faster than its predecessors.</strong> It clocks in at 2x faster
than the benchmarked 2011 Sandy Bridge model (keep in mind the 300 MHz
base clock difference) and is ~34% faster than the 2012 Ivy Bridge (at
similar clock speed). Personally, I was surprised by this. I was
expecting speed improvements over Ivy Bridge, but not 34%.</p>
<p>It should go without saying: <strong>if you have the opportunity to upgrade
to a new, Haswell-based machine: do it.</strong> If possible, purchase
the upgrade to a 2.6 GHz CPU, as it contains ~13% more MHz than the
base 2.3 GHz model: this will make a measurable difference in build
times.</p>
<p>It's worth noting the increased efficiency of Haswell over its
predecessors. The total CPU time required to build decreased from ~158
minutes to ~103 minutes to 76 minutes! That 76 minute number is worth
highlighting because it means if we get 100% CPU saturation during
builds, we'll be able to build the tree in under 10 wall time minutes!</p>
<p>I hadn't performed crude benchmarks of high-level build system actions
since the <em>MOZ_PSEUDO_DERECURSE</em> work landed and I wanted to use the
opportunity of this hardware comparison to grab some numbers.</p>
<p>The overhead of ccache continues to surprise me. On the 2013
machine, enabling ccache increased the wall time of a clobber build by
1:46 and added 13:16 of CPU time. This is an increase of 16% and 17%,
respectively.</p>
<p>It's worth highlighting just how much time is spent compiling C/C++. In
our artificial tier measuring results, our clobber build time was ~660
wall time seconds (11 minutes) and used ~4473s CPU time (74:33). Of
this, 9:01 wall time and 70:06 CPU time was spent compiling C/C++. This
represents ~82% wall time and ~94% CPU time! Please note this does not
include linking. <strong>Anything we can do to decrease the CPU time used by
the compiler will make the build faster.</strong></p>
<p>I also found it interesting to note variances in obtained times. Even on
my brand new 2013 Haswell MacBook Pro where I know there aren't many
background processes running, wall times could vary significantly. I
<em>think</em> I isolated it to CPU bursting and heat issues. If I wait a few
minutes between CPU intensive tests, results are pretty consistent. But
if I perform CPU intensive tests back-to-back, the run times often vary.
The only other thing coming into play could be page caching or
filesystem indexing. I accounted for the latter by disabling Finder
on the object directory. And, I'd like to think that flash storage is
fast enough to remove I/O latency from the equation. Who knows. At the
end of the day, laptops aren't servers and OS X is a consumer OS, so I
don't expect ultra consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to restate just how fast Haswell is. If you have the
opportunity to upgrade, do it.</p>
