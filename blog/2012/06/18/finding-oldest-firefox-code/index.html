  <p>On Twitter the other night, Justin Dolske
<a href="https://twitter.com/dolske/status/214241105179451393">posed a question</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Weekend challenge: what is the oldest line of code still shipping
in Firefox (tiebreaker: largest contiguous chunk)?
</code></pre>
<p>Good question and good challenge!</p>
<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
<p>To solve this problem, I decided my first task would be to produce a
database holding line-by-line metadata for files <em>currently</em> in the
Firefox repository. This sounded like a difficult problem at first,
especially considering the Mercurial repository doesn't contain CVS
history and this would be needed to identify code older than Mercurial
that is <em>still</em> active.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there exists a
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/">Git repository</a> with full
history of mozilla-central, including CVS and Mercurial! Armed with a
clone of this repository, I wrote a quick shell <em>one-liner</em> to ascertain
the history of every line in the repository:</p>
<pre><code>for f in `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD`; do \
  echo "BEGIN_RECORD $f"; \
  git blame -l -t -M -C -n -w -p $f; \
  echo "END_RECORD $f"; \
done
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>git ls-tree</em> command prints the names of every file in
the current tree. This is basically doing <em>find . -type f</em> except for
files under version control by Git. <em>git blame</em> attempts to ascertain
the history of each line in a file. It is worth pointing out arguments
<em>-M</em> and <em>-C</em>. These attempt to find moves/copies of the line from
within the same commit. If these are omitted, simple refactoring such as
renaming a file or reordering code within a file would result in a
improper commit attribution. Basically, Git would associate the line
with the commit that changed it. With these flags, Git attempts to
complete the chain and find the true origin of the line (to some
degree).</p>
<p>Now, something I thought was really cool is <em>git blame</em>'s porcelain
output format (<em>-p</em>). Not only does it allow for relatively simple machine
readability of the output (yay), but it also compacts the output
so adjacent lines sharing the same history metadata share the
same metadata/header block. In other words, it solves Dolske's <em>largest
contiguous chunk</em> tiebreaker for free! Thanks, Git!</p>
<p>I should also say that <em>git blame</em> isn't perfect for attributing code.
But I think it is good enough to solve a Twitter challenge.</p>
<p>I piped the output of the above command into a file so I could have the
original data available to process. After all, this data is idempotent,
so it makes no sense to <em>not</em> save it. After running for a while, I noticed
things were running slower than I'd like. I think it took about 2 hours
to obtain info for ~5000 files. No good. I played around a bit and
realized the <em>-M</em> and <em>-C</em> flags were slowing things down. This is
expected. But, I really wanted this data for a comprehensive data
analysis.</p>
<p>I re-discovered <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>
and modified my one-liner to use <strong>all the cores</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | \
parallel 'echo "BEGIN_RECORD {}"; git blame -l -t -M -C -n -w -p {}; echo "END_RECORD {}"'
</code></pre>
<p>This made things run <em>substantially</em> faster since I was now running on
all 8 cores, not just 1. With GNU Parallel, this simple kind of
parallelism is almost too easy. Now, I say <em>substantially</em> faster, but
overall execution is still slow. How slow? Well, on my Sandy Bridge Macbook
Pro:</p>
<pre><code>real  525m49.149s
user  3592m15.862s
sys   201m4.482s
</code></pre>
<p>8:45 wall time and nearly 60 hours of CPU time. Yeah, I'm surprised
my laptop didn't explode too! The output file was 1,099,071,448 bytes
uncompressed and 155,354,423 bzipped.</p>
<p>While Git was obtaining data, I set about writing a consumer and data
processor. I'm sure the wheel of parsing this <em>porcelain</em> output format
has been invented before. But, I hadn't coded any Perl in a while and
figured this was as good of an excuse as any!</p>
<p>The Perl script to do the parsing and data analysis is available at
<a href="https://gist.github.com/2945604">https://gist.github.com/2945604</a>.
The core parsing function simply calls a supplied callback whenever a
new <em>block</em> of code from the same commit/file is encountered.</p>
<p>I implemented a function that records a mapping of commit times to
blocks. Finally, I wrote a simple function to write the results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>What did 60 hours of CPU time tell us? Well, the oldest recorded line
dates from 1998-03-28. This is actually the <em>Free the Lizard</em> commit -
the first commit of open source Gecko to CVS. From this commit (Git
commit 781c48087175615674 for those playing at home), a number of lines
linger, including code for <em>mkdepend</em> and <em>nsinstall</em>.</p>
<p>But, Dolske's question was about <em>shipping</em> code. Well, as far as I can
tell, the oldest shipping code in the tree honor is shared by the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>js/jsd/jsd1640.rc (pretty much the whole file)</li>
<li>js/jsd/jsd3240.rc (ditto)</li>
<li>js/jsd/jsd_atom.c:47-73</li>
<li>js/src/jsfriendapi.cpp:388-400</li>
<li>js/src/yarr/YarrParser.h:295-523</li>
<li>media/libjpeg/jdarith.c:21-336</li>
<li>media/libjpeg/jctrans.c:20-178</li>
<li>media/libjpeg (misc files all have large blocks)</li>
<li>xpcom/components/nsComponentManager.cpp:897-901</li>
<li>gfx/src/nsTransform2D.h (a couple 3-4 line chunks)</li>
<li>toolkit/library/nsDllMain.cpp:22-31</li>
<li>widget/windows/nsUXThemeData.cpp:213-257</li>
<li>widget/windows/nsWindowGfx.cpp:756-815</li>
<li>xpcom/ds/nsUnicharBuffer.cpp:14-33</li>
<li>xpcom/glue/nsCRTGlue.cpp:128-174</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a few small chunks of 1 or 2 lines in a couple dozen
other files from that initial commit.</p>
<h2>Further Analysis</h2>
<p>If anyone is interested in performing additional analysis, you can just
take my Gist and install your own <em>onBlock</em> and output formatting
functions! Of course, you'll need a data set. My code is written so it
will work with any Git repository. If you want to analyze Firefox, it
will take hours of CPU time to extract the data from Git. To save some
time, you can obtain a copy of the raw data from commit
<a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~gszorc/mc-blame-0b961fb702a9576cb456.bz2">0b961fb702a9576cb456809410209adbbb956bc8</a>.</p>
<p>There is certainly no shortage of interesting analysis that
can be performed over this data set. Some that come to mind are a
<em>scoreboard</em> for most lines of code in the current tree (friendly
competition, anyone?) and a breakdown of active lines by the period they
were introduced.</p>
<p>I'll leave more advanced analysis as an exercise for the reader.</p>
