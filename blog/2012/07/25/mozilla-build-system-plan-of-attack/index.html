  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Since I published my <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/06/25/improving-mozilla%27s-build-system/">brain dump
post</a>
on improving Mozilla's build system for Gecko applications (including
Firefox and Firefox OS), there has been some exciting progress.</p>
<p>It wasn't stated in that original post, but the context for that post
was to propose a plan in preparation of a meeting between the core
contributors to the build system at Mozilla. I'm pleased to report that
the plan was generally well-received.</p>
<p>We pretty much all agreed that parts 1, 2, and 3 are all important and
we should actively work towards them. Parts 4, 5, and 6 were a bit more
contentious. There are some good parts and some bad parts. We're not
ready to adopt them just quite yet. (Don't bother reading the original
post to look up what these parts corresponded to - I'll cover that
later.)</p>
<p>Since that post and meeting, there has also been additional discussion
around more specifics. I am going to share with you now where we stand.</p>
<h2>BuildSplendid</h2>
<p><strong>BuildSplendid</strong> is an umbrella term associated with projects/goals to
make the developer experience (including building) better - more
splendid if you will.</p>
<p><strong>BuildSplendid</strong> started as the name of my personal Git branch for
hacking on the build system. I'm encouraging others to adopt the term
because, well, it is easier to refer to (people like project codenames).
If it doesn't stick, that's fine by me - there are other terms that
will.</p>
<h2>BuildFaster</h2>
<p>An important project inside <em>BuildSplendid</em> is <strong>BuildFaster</strong>.</p>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> focuses on the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the <em>existing</em> build system faster, better, stronger (but not
   harder).</li>
<li>Making changes to the build system to facilitate the <em>future</em> use of
   alternate build backends (like Tup or Ninja). Work to enable Visual
   Studio, Xcode, etc project generation also falls here.</li>
</ol>
<p>The distinction between these goals can be murky. But, I'll try.</p>
<p>Falling squarely in #1 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the buildbot infrastructure to use pymake on Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Falling in #2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making Makefile.in's data-centric</li>
<li>Supporting multiple build backends</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflated between the two are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring Makefile's no-op if nothing has changed</li>
<li>Optimizing existing make rules. This involves merging related
  functionality as well as eliminating clown shoes in existing rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two goals of <em>BuildFaster</em> roughly map to the short-term and long-term
strategies, respectively. There is consensus that recursive make (our
existing build backend) does not scale and we will plateau in terms of
performance no matter how optimal we make it. That doesn't mean we are
giving up on it: there are things we can and should do so our existing
non-recursive make backend builds faster.</p>
<p>In parallel, we will also work towards the longer-term solution of
supporting alternate build backends. <strong>This includes non-recursive
make</strong> as well as things like Tup, Ninja, and even Visual Studio and
Xcode. (I consider non-recursive make to be a separate build backend
because changing our existing Makefile.in's to support non-recursive
execution effectively means rewriting the input files (Makefile.in's).
At that point, you've invented a new build backend.)</p>
<p>For people who casually interact with the build system, these two goals
will blend together. It is not important for most to know what bucket
something falls under.</p>
<h3>BuildFaster Action Items</h3>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> action items are being tracked in Bugzilla using the
[BuildFaster:*] whiteboard annotation.</p>
<p>There is no explicit tracking bug for the short-term goal (#1). Instead,
we are relying on the whiteboard annotation.</p>
<p>We are tracking the longer-term goal of supporting alternate build
backends at <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774049">bug 774049</a>.</p>
<p>The most important task to help us reach the goals is to make our
Makefile.in's data centric. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makefile.in's <strong>must</strong> consist of only simple variable assignment</li>
<li>Makefile.in's <strong>must</strong> not rely on being evaluated to perform variable
  assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, our build config should be defined by static key-value pairs.</p>
<p>This translates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move all rules out of Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769378">bug 769378</a></li>
<li>Remove use of $(shell) from Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769390">bug 769390</a></li>
<li>Remove filesystem functions from Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769407">bug 769407</a></li>
<li>And more, as we identify the need</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have these tracking bugs on file, we still don't have bugs
filed that track individual Makefile.in's that need updated. <strong>If you
are a contributor, you can help by doing your part to file bugs for your
Makefile.in's.</strong> If your Makefile.in violates the above rules, please
file a bug in the <strong>Build Config</strong> component of the product it is under
(typically <strong>Core</strong>). See the tree of the above bugs for examples.</p>
<p>Also part of <em>BuildFaster</em> (but not relevant to most) is the task of
changing the build system to support multiple backends. Currently,
pieces like <em>configure</em> assume the Makefile.in to Makefile conversion is
always what is wanted. These parts will be worked on by core
contributors to the build system and thus aren't of concern to most.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that a lot of the work to <em>purify</em>
Makefile.in's to be data centric will look like a lot of busy work with
little immediate gain. The real benefits to this work will manifest
down the road. That being said, removing rules from Makefile.in's and
implementing things as rules in rules.mk helps ensure that the
implementation is proper (rules.mk is coded by make ninjas and thus
probably does things <em>right</em>). This can lead to faster build times.</p>
<h2>mozbuild</h2>
<p><strong>mozbuild</strong> is a Python package that provides an API to the build system.</p>
<p>What <em>mozbuild</em> will contain is still up in the air because it hasn't
landed in mozilla-central yet. In the code I'm waiting on review to
uplift to mozilla-central, <em>mozbuild</em> contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>An API for invoking the build system backend (e.g. launching make). It
  basically reimplements client.mk because client.mk sucks and needs to
  be replaced.</li>
<li>An API for launching tests easily. This reimplements functionality in
  testsuite-targets.mk, but in a much cleaner way. Running a single test
  can now be done with a single Python function call. This may sound
  boring, but it is very useful. You just import a module and pass a
  filesystem path to a test file to a function and a test runs. Boom!</li>
<li>Module for extracting compiler warnings from build output and storing
  in a persisted database for post-build retrieval. Compiler warning
  tracking \o/</li>
<li>Module for converting build system output into structured logs. It
  records things like time spent in different directories, etc. We could
  use this for tracking build performance regressions. We just need a
  arewe*yet.com domain...</li>
<li>A replacement for .mozconfig's that sucks less (stronger validation,
  settings for not just build config, convenient Python API, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, upcoming features which I haven't yet tried to land in
mozilla-central include:</p>
<ul>
<li>API for extracting metadata from Makefile.in's and other frontend
  files. Want a Python class instance describing the IDLs defined in an
  individual Makefile.in or across the entire tree? <em>mozbuild</em> can provide
  that. This functionality will be used to configure alternate build
  backends.</li>
<li>Build backend API which allows for different build backends to be
  configured (e.g. recursive make, Tup, Ninja, etc). When we support
  multiple build backends, they'll live in <em>mozbuild</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> can really be thought of as a clean backend to the build
system and related functionality (like running tests). Everything in
<em>mozbuild</em> could exist in make files or in .py files littered in
<em>build/</em>, <em>config/</em>, etc. But, that would involve maintaining make files
and/or not having a cohesive API. I wanted a clean slate that was free
from the burdens of the existing world. <em>mozbuild</em> was born.</p>
<p>I concede that there will be non-clear lines of division between
<em>mozbuild</em> and other Python packages and/or Mozilla modules. For
example, is <em>mozbuild</em> the appropriate location to define an API for
taking the existing build configuration and launching a Mochitest? I'm
not sure. For now, I'm stuffing functionality inside <em>mozbuild</em> unless
there is a clear reason for it to exist elsewhere. If we want to
separate (because of module ownership issues, for example), we can do
that.</p>
<p>My vision for <em>mozbuild</em> is for it to be the answer to the question
<em>how does the Mozilla build system work?</em> You should be able to say,
<em>look at the code in python/mozbuild and you will have all the answers.</em></p>
<h3>mozbuild Action Items</h3>
<p>The single action item for <em>mozbuild</em> is getting it landed. I have code
written that I think is good enough for an initial landing (with obvious
shortcomings being addressed in follow-up bugs). It just needs some love
from reviewers.</p>
<p>Landing <em>mozbuild</em> is tracked in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a>. I
initially dropped a monolithic patch. I have since started splitting
bits up into bite-sized patches to facilitate faster, smaller reviews.
(See the blocking bugs.)</p>
<h2>mach</h2>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> is just a Python package - an API. It has no frontend.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>mach</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mach</strong> is a command-line frontend to <em>mozbuild</em> and beyond.</p>
<p>Currently, <em>mach</em> provides some convenient shortcuts for performing
common tasks. e.g. you can run a test by tab-completing to its filename
using your shell. It also provides nifty output in supported terminals,
including colorizing and a basic progress indicator during building.</p>
<p>You can think of <em>mach</em> as a replacement for <em>client.mk</em> and other make
targets. But, <em>mach</em>'s purpose doesn't end there. My vision for <em>mach</em>
is for it to be the one-stop shop for all your mozilla-central
interaction needs.</p>
<p>From a mozilla-central tree, you should be able to type
<strong>./mach <action></strong> and do whatever you need to do. This could be
building Firefox, running tests, uploading a patch to Bugzilla, etc.</p>
<p>I'm capturing ideas for <em>mach</em> features in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774108">bug 774108</a>.</p>
<h3>mach Action Items</h3>
<p><em>mach</em> is in the same boat as <em>mozbuild</em>: it's waiting for reviewer
love. If you are interested in reviewing it, please let me know.</p>
<p>Once <em>mach</em> lands, I will be looking to the larger community to improve
it. I want people to go wild implementing features. I believe that
<em>mach</em> will have a significant positive impact on driving contributions
to Mozilla because it will make the process much more streamlined and
less prone to error. I think it is a no-brainer to check in <em>mach</em> as
soon as possible so these wins can be realized.</p>
<p>There is an open question of who will own <em>mach</em> in terms of module
ownership. <em>mach</em> isn't really part of anything. Sure, it interacts with
the build system, testing code, tools, etc. But, it isn't actually part
of any of that. Maybe a new module will be created for it. I'm not
familiar with how the modules system works and I would love to chat with
someone about options here.</p>
<h2>Project Interaction</h2>
<p>How are all of these projects related?</p>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> is what everyone is working on today. It currently focuses
on making the existing recursive make based build backend faster using
whatever means necessary. <em>BuildFaster</em> could theoretically evolve to
cover other build backends (like non-recursive make). Time will tell
what falls under the <em>BuildFaster</em> banner.</p>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> is immediately focused on providing the functionality to
enable <em>mach</em> to land.</p>
<p><em>mach</em> is about improving the overall developer experience when
it comes to contributing to Firefox and other in-tree applications (like
Firefox OS). It's related to the build system in that it provides a nice
frontend to it. That's the only relationship. <em>mach</em> isn't part of the
build system (at least not yet - it may eventually be used to perform
actions on buildbot machines).</p>
<p>Down the road, <em>mozbuild</em> will gain lots of new features core to the
build system. It will learn how to extract metadata from Makefile.in's
which can be used by other build backends. It will define a build
backend interface and the various build backends will be implemented
in mozbuild. Aspects of the existing build system currently implemented in
make files or in various Python files scattered across the tree will be
added to <em>mozbuild</em> and exposed with a clean, reusable, and testable
API.</p>
<p>Today, <em>BuildFaster</em> is the important project with all the attention.
When <em>mach</em> lands, it will (hopefully) gather a lot of attention. But,
it will be from a different group (the larger contributor community -
not just build system people).</p>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> today is only needed to support <em>mach</em>. But, once <em>mozbuild</em>
lands and <em>mach</em> is on its own, <em>mozbuild</em>'s purpose  will shift to support
<em>BuildFaster</em> and other activities under the <em>BuildSplendid</em> banner.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us. Please look at the bugs linked above
and help out in any way you can.</p>
