  <p>In my course of hacking about with Mozilla's build system, I've been
using pymake (a Python implementation of GNU make) to parse, examine,
and manipulate make files. In doing so, I've learned some interesting
things, dispelling myths in the process.</p>
<p>People often say that parsing make files is slow and that the sheer
number of Makefile.in's in mozilla-central (Firefox's source tree) is
leading to lots of overhead in make execution. This statement is only
partially correct.</p>
<p><em>Parsing</em> make files is actually pretty fast. Using pymake's parser API,
I'm able to parse every Makefile.in in mozilla-central in under 5
seconds on my 2011 generation MacBook Pro using a single core. Not too
shabby, especially considering that there are about 82,500 lines in all
the Makefile.in's.</p>
<p>Evaluation of make files, however, is a completely different story. You
see, parsing a string containing make file directives is only part of
what needs to be done. Once you've parsed a make file into a statement
list (essentially an AST), you need to load that into a data structure
fit for evaluation. Because of the way make files are evaluated,
you need to iterate through every parsed statement and evaluate it
for side-effects. This occurs before you actually evaluate specific
targets in the make file itself. As I found out, this process can be
time-consuming.</p>
<p>For mozilla-central, the cost of loading the statement list into a data
structure ready for target evaluation takes about 1 minute in aggregate.
And, considering we effectively iterate through every Makefile in
mozilla-central 3 times when building (once for every tier state of
export, libs, and tools), you can multiply this figure by 3.</p>
<p>Put another way, <em>parsing</em> Makefile's is fast: loading them for
target evaluation is slow.</p>
<p>Digging deeper, I uncovered the main source of the additional overhead:
<em>rules.mk</em>.</p>
<p>Nearly every Makefile in mozilla-central has a pattern that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>DEPTH = ../..
topsrcdir = @top_srcdir@
srcdir = @srcdir@
VPATH = @srcdir@

include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

&lt;LOCAL MAKE FILE DECLARATIONS&gt;

include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk
</code></pre>
<p>We have a header boilerplate, followed by a bunch of Makefile-specific
variables definitions and rules. Finally, we include the <em>rules.mk</em>
file. This is the make file that takes specially-named variables and
converts them to rules (actions) for make to perform.</p>
<p>A typical Makefile.in is a few dozen lines or so. This often reduces to
maybe a dozen parsed statements. By contrast, <em>rules.mk</em> is massive. It
is currently 1770 lines and may include other make files, bringing the
total to ~3000 lines.</p>
<p>Pymake has an LRU cache that caches the results of <em>parsing</em> make files.
This means it only has to parse a single make file into a statement list
once (assuming no cache eviction). <em>rules.mk</em> is frequently used, so it
should have no eviction. Even if it were evicted, I've measured that
<em>parsing</em> is pretty fast.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cache doesn't help with evaluation. For every
Makefile in mozilla-central, pymake will need to evaluate rules.mk
within the context of that specific Makefile. It's impossible to cache
the results of a previous evaluation because the side-effects of rules.mk
are determined by what is defined in the Makefile that includes it.</p>
<p>I performed an experiment where I stripped the <em>include rules.mk</em>
statement from all parsed Makefile.in's. This essentially isolates the
overhead of loading <em>rules.mk</em>. It turns out that all but ~2 seconds
of evaluation time is spent in <em>rules.mk</em>. In other words,
without <em>rules.mk</em>, the Makefile.in's are loaded and ready for evaluation
in just a few seconds (over parsing time), not ~1 minute!</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>Is <em>parsing</em> make files slow? Technically no. <em>Parsing</em> itself is not slow.
It is actually quite fast! Pymake even surprised me at how fast it can
parse all the Makefile.in's in mozilla-central.</p>
<p><em>Loading</em> parsed make file statements to be ready for evaluation is
actually the bit that is slow - at least in the case of mozilla-central.
Specifically, the loading of <em>rules.mk</em> is what constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the time spent loading Makefile's.</p>
<p>That being said, <em>parsing</em> and <em>loading</em> go hand in hand. You almost
never parse a make file without loading and evaluating it. So, if you
consider <em>parsing</em> to include parsing <em>and</em> readying the make file for
execution, there is some truth to the statement that parsing make files
is slow. Someone splitting hairs may say differently.</p>
<p>Is there anything we can do? Good question.</p>
<p>I believe that build times of mozilla-central can be reduced by reducing
the size of <em>rules.mk</em>. Obviously, the content of <em>rules.mk</em> is
important, so we can't just delete content. But, we can be more
intelligent about how it is loaded. For example, we can move pieces of
<em>rules.mk</em> into separate <em>.mk</em> files and conditionally include these
files based on the presence of specific variables. We already do this
today, but only partially: there are still a number of bits of rules.mk
that could be factored out into separate files. By conditionally loading
make file content from <em>rules.mk</em>, we would be reducing the number of
statements that need to be loaded before evaluating each Makefile. And,
this should, in turn, make build times faster. Keep in mind that any
savings will be multiplied by roughly 3 since we do 3 passes over
Makefile's during a build.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there aren't any bugs yet on file to do this. Given the
measurements I've obtained, I encourage somebody to do this work. Even
if it doesn't reduce build times, I think it will be a win since it will
make the make rules easier to understand since they will be contained in
function-specific files rather than one monolithic file. At worse, we
have better readability. At best, we have better readability and faster
build times. Win!</p>
<p>Finally, I don't know what the impact on GNU make is. Presumably, GNU
make evaluates make files faster than pymake (C is generally faster than
python). Therefore, reducing the size of <em>rules.mk</em> should make GNU make
faster. By how much, I have no clue.</p>
