  <p><em>tl;dr User experience matters and developers are people too. I
have proposed a tool to help developers interact with the Firefox build
system and source tree.</em></p>
<p>I don't think I have to make my case when I state that Mozilla's build
system end-user experience is lacking. There are lots of hurdles to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine where to obtain the source code.</li>
<li>Install a source control system (possibly).</li>
<li>Wait a <em>long</em> time for the large source repository to download.</li>
<li>Figure out how to launch the build process (unlike many other build
  systems, it isn't as simple as <code>configure</code> or <code>make</code> - although it is
  close).</li>
<li>Determine which dependencies need to be installed and install them
  (this can also take a long time).</li>
<li>Create a configuration file (mozconfig).</li>
<li>Build the tree (another long process).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute patches, there are additional steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure Mercurial with your personal info.</li>
<li>Configure Mercurial to generate patches in proper format.</li>
<li>Create a Bugzilla account (made simpler through Persona!).</li>
<li>Figure out the proper Bugzilla product/component (even I still
  struggle at this) so you can file a bug.</li>
<li>Figure out how to attach a patch to a bug and request review (it isn't
  intuitive if you've never used Bugzilla before).</li>
<li>Figure out who should review patch.</li>
<li>Learn how tests work so you can:</li>
<li>Write new tests.</li>
<li>Run existing tests to verify your changes.</li>
<li>Obtain commit access (so at least you can push to Try).</li>
<li>Learn how to push to Try.</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">TBPL</a>.</li>
<li>Discover and use some of the amazing tools to help you
  (<a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/">MXR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>,
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sfink/mqext">mqext</a>, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted, not all of these are required. But, they will be for returning
contributors. My point is that there are lots of steps here. And, every
one of them represents a point where someone could get frustrated and
bail -- a point where Mozilla loses a potential contributor.</p>
<p>Ever since I started at Mozilla, I've been thinking of ways this could
be done better. While the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide">Developer Guide</a>
on MDN has improved drastically in the last year, there are still many
ways the process could be improved and streamlined.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a>,
I've put forward the groundwork of a tool to make the developer
experience more user friendly. Yes, this is a vague goal, so let me go
in to further detail.</p>
<p>What I've submitted in the bug is essentially a framework for
performing common actions related to the build system and source tree.
These actions are defined as methods in Python code. Hooking it all
together is a command-line interface which is launched via a short
script in the root directory called <em>mach</em> (<em>mach</em> is German for <em>do</em>).
Since actions speak louder than words, here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach

usage: mach command [command arguments]

This program is your main control point for the Mozilla source tree.

To perform an action, specify it as the first argument. Here are some common
actions:

  mach build         Build the source tree.
  mach help          Show full help.
  mach xpcshell-test Run xpcshell test(s).

To see more help for a specific action, run:

  mach &lt;command&gt; --help

e.g. mach build --help
</code></pre>
<p>And, going into a sub-command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach xpcshell-test --help

usage: mach xpcshell-test [-h] [--debug] [TEST]

positional arguments:
  TEST         Test to run. Can be specified as a single JS file, an
               xpcshell.ini manifest file, a directory, or omitted. If
               omitted, the entire xpcshell suite is executed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --debug, -d  Run test in debugger.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I've focused effort at this stage on performing actions after the
initial build environment is configured. The reason is this is
low-hanging fruit and easily allows me to create a proof-of-concept.
But, I have many more ideas that I'd eventually like to see implemented.</p>
<p>One of my grand ideas is to have some kind of setup wizard guide
you through the first time you use <em>mach</em>. It can start by asking the
basics: "Which application do you want to build?" "Release or Debug?"
"Clang or GCC?" "Should I install Clang for you?" It could also be more
intelligent about installing dependencies. "I see you are using Ubuntu
and are missing required packages X and Y. Would you like me to install
them?" And, why stop at a command-line interface? There's no reason a
graphical frontend (perhaps Tcl/Tk) couldn't be implemented!</p>
<p>The setup wizard could even encompass configuring your source control
system for proper patch generation by ensuring your tree-local <em>.hg/hgrc</em>
or <em>.git/config</em> files have the proper settings. We could even ask you
for Bugzilla credentials so you could interact with Bugzilla directly
from the command-line.</p>
<p>Once we have all of the basic configs in place, it's just a matter of
hooking up the plumbing. Want to submit a patch for review? We could
provide a command for that:</p>
<pre><code>./mach submit-patch

"refactor-foo" is currently on top of your patch queue.

Submit "refactor-foo"?
y/n: y

Enter bug number for patch or leave empty for no existing bug.
Bug number:

OK. A new bug for this patch will be created.

Please enter a one-line summary of the patch:
Summary: Refactor foo subsystem

Is the patch for (r)eview, (f)eedback, or (n)either?
r/f/n: r

</code></pre>
<p>The framework is extremely flexible and extensible for a few reasons.
First, it encourages all of the core <em>actions</em> to be implemented as
Python modules/methods. Once you have things defined as API calls (not
shell scripts), the environment feels like a cohesive library rather than
a loose collection of shell scripts. Shell scripts have a place, don't get
me wrong. But, they are hard to debug and test (not to mention performance
penalties on Windows). Writing code as reusable libraries with shell
scripts only being the frontend is a more robust approach to software
design.</p>
<p>Second, the command-line driver is implemented as a collection of
sub-commands. This is similar to how version control systems like Git,
Mercurial, and Subversion work. This makes discovery of features
extremely easy: just list the supported commands! Contrast this to our
current build system, where the answer is to consult a wiki (with likely
out-of-date and fragmented information) or <em>gasp</em> try to read the
makefiles in the tree.</p>
<p>My immediate goal for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a> is to
get a minimal framework checked in to the tree with a core design people
are content with. Once that is done, <strong>I'm hoping other people will come
along and implement additional features and commands.</strong> Specifically, I'd
like to see some of the awesome tools like <em>mqext</em> integrated such that
their power can be harnessed without requiring people to first discover
they exist and second install and configure them. I think it is silly for
these obvious productivity wins to go unused by people ignrant of their
existence. If they are valuable, let's ship them as part of a batteries
included environment.</p>
<p>In the long run, I think there are many more uses for this framework.
For starters, it gives us a rallying point around which to organize all
of the Python support/tools code in the tree. Currently, we have things
spread all over the place. Quite frankly, it is a mess. I'd like to have
a unified <em>site-packages</em> tree with all our Python so things are easier to
locate and thus improve.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the tool provides a framework for logging and
formatting activities in a unified way. There are separate log streams:
one for humans, one for machines. Under the hood, they both use the
saming logging infrastructure. When messages are logged, the human
stream is formatted as simple sentences (complete with terminal
encodings and colorization). The machine-destined log stream is
newline-delimited JSON containing the fields that were logged. This
allows analysis of output without having to parse strings. This is how
all log analysis should be done. But, that's for another post. Anyway,
what this all means is that the output for humans can be more readable.
Colors, progress bars: we can do that now.</p>
<p>Over time, I imagine some may want to move logic out of configure and
makefiles and into this tool (because Python is easier to maintain and
debug, IMO). I would love to see that too. But, I want to stress that this
isn't a focus right now. I believe this framework should be supplemental
in the beginning and the official build system should not rely on it. Maybe
that changes in the future. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Anyway, this project is currently just my solo effort. This isn't
captured on a roadmap or anyone's quarterly goals. There is no project page
listing planned features. If you are interested in helping, drop me a line
and/or join in on the bug. Hopefully the core framework will land soon.
Once it does, I'm hoping for an explosion of new, user-friendly
features/commands to make the overall Firefox development experience
smoother.</p>
