  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've used Python more than any other programming language in the past
4-5 years. Python is the lingua franca for Firefox's build, test, and
CI tooling. Mercurial is written in mostly Python. Many of my
side-projects are in Python.</p>
<p>Along the way, I've accrued a bit of knowledge about Python
performance and how to optimize Python. This post is about sharing
that knowledge with the larger community.</p>
<p>My experience with Python is mostly with the CPython interpreter,
specifically CPython 2.7. Not all observations apply to all Python
distributions or have the same characteristics across Python versions.
I'll try to call this out when relevant. And this post is in no
way a thorough survey of the Python performance landscape. I mainly
want to highlight areas that have particularly plagued me.</p>
<h2>Startup and Module Importing Overhead</h2>
<p>Starting a Python interpreter and importing Python modules is
relatively slow if you care about milliseconds.</p>
<p>If you need to start hundreds or thousands of Python processes
as part of a workload, this overhead will amount to several seconds
of overhead.</p>
<p>If you use Python to provide CLI tools, the overhead can cause
enough lag to be noticeable by people. If you want <em>instantaneous</em>
CLI tools, launching a Python interpreter on every invocation will
make it very difficult to achieve that with a sufficiently complex
tool.</p>
<p>I've written about this problem extensively. My
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-May/134528.html">2014 post on python-dev</a>
outlines the problem. Posts in
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-May/153296.html">May 2018</a>
and <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">October 2018</a>
restate and refine it.</p>
<p>There's not much you can do to alleviate interpreter startup overhead:
fixing this mostly resides with the maintainers of the Python
interpreter because they control the code that is taking precious
milliseconds to complete. About the best you can do is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id3">disable the site import</a>
in your shebangs and invocations to avoid some extra Python code
running at startup. However, many applications rely on functionality
provided by <code>site.py</code>, so use at your own risk.</p>
<p>Related to this is the problem of module importing. What good is a
Python interpreter if it doesn't have code to run! And the way code
is made available to the interpreter is often through importing
modules.</p>
<p>There are multiple steps to importing modules. And there are sources
of overhead in each one.</p>
<p>There is overhead in finding modules and reading their data. As
I've <a href="/blog/2019/01/06/pyoxidizer-support-for-windows/">demonstrated with PyOxidizer</a>,
replacing the default <em>find and load a module from the filesystem</em>
with an architecturally simpler solution of <em>read the module data
from an in-memory data structure</em> makes importing the Python standard
library take 70-80% of its original time! Having a single module
per filesystem file introduces filesystem overhead and can slow
down Python applications in the critical first milliseconds of
execution. Solutions like PyOxidizer can mitigate this. And hopefully
the Python community sees the overhead in the current approach
and considers moving towards module distribution mechanisms that
don't rely so much on separate files per module.</p>
<p>Another source of module importing overhead is executing code in
that module at import time. Some modules have code in the module
scope outside of functions and classes that runs when the module
is imported. This code execution can add overhead to importing. A
mitigation for this is to not run as much code at import time: only
run code as needed. Python 3.7 supports a module <code>__getattr__</code>
that will be called when a module attribute is not found. This can
be used to lazily populate module attributes on first access.</p>
<p>Another workaround for module importing slowness is lazy module
importing. Instead of actually loading a module when it is imported,
you register a custom module importer that returns a <em>stub</em> for
that module instead. When that stub is first accessed, it will
load the actual module and mutate itself to be that module.</p>
<p>By avoiding the filesystem and module running overhead for unused
modules (modules are typically imported globally and then only
used by certain functions in a module), you can easily shave
dozens of milliseconds from applications importing several dozens
of modules.</p>
<p>But lazy module importers are a bit fragile. Lots of modules
have a pattern where they <code>try: import foo; except ImportError:</code>.
A lazy module importer may never raise <code>ImportError</code> here because
to do so, it would need to search the filesystem for a module
to know if it exists and searching the filesystem would add overhead,
so they don't do it! You work around this by accessing an attribute
on the imported module. This forces the <code>ImportError</code> to be raised
if the module doesn't exist but undermines the laziness of the module
import! This problem is quite nasty. Mercurial's lazy module
importer has to maintain a list of modules that are known to not
be lazy importable to work around it. Another issue is the
<code>from foo import x, y</code> syntax, which also undermines lazy module
importing in cases where <code>foo</code> is a module (as opposed to a package)
because in order to return a reference to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the module
has to be imported.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer, having a fixed set of modules <em>frozen</em> into the binary,
can be efficient about raising <code>ImportError</code>. And Python 3.7's
module <code>__getattr__</code> provides additional flexibility for lazy
module importers. I hope to integrate a robust lazy module importer
into <code>PyOxidizer</code> so these gains are realized automatically.</p>
<p>The best solution to avoiding the interpreter startup and module
import overhead problem is to run a persistent Python process.
If you run Python in a daemon process (say for a web server), you
pretty much get this for free. Mercurial's solution to this is to
run a persistent Python process in the background which exposes a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer">command server</a>
protocol. <code>hg</code> is aliased to a C (or now Rust) executable
which connects to that persistent process and dispatches a
command. The command server approach is a lot of work and can
be a bit fragile and has security concerns. I'm exploring the
idea of shipping a command server with <code>PyOxidizer</code> so
executable can easily gain its benefits and the cost to solving
the problem only needs to be paid in one central place: the
<code>PyOxidizer</code> project.</p>
<h2>Function Call Overhead</h2>
<p>Function calls in Python are relatively slow. (This observation
applies less to PyPy, which can JIT code execution.)</p>
<p>I've seen literally dozens of patches to Mercurial where we inline
code or combine Python functions in order to avoid function
call overhead. In the current development cycle, some effort was
made to reduce the number of functions called when updating
progress bars. (We try to use progress bars for any operation
that could take a while so users know what is going on.) The
old progress bar update code would dispatch to a handful of
functions.
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/6603de284b0a">Caching function call results</a>
and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/963462786f6e">avoiding simple lookups via functions</a>
shaves dozens to hundreds of milliseconds off execution when we're
talking about 1 million executions.</p>
<p>If you have tight loops or recursive functions in Python where
hundreds of thousands or more function calls could be in play, you
need to be aware of the overhead of calling an individual function,
as it can add up quickly! Consider in-lining simple functions
and combining functions to avoid the overhead.</p>
<h2>Attribute Lookup Overhead</h2>
<p>This problem is similar to function call overhead because it
can actually be the same problem!</p>
<p>Resolving an attribute in Python can be relatively slow. (Again,
this observation applies less to PyPy.)</p>
<p>Again, working around this issue is something we do a lot in
Mercurial.</p>
<p>Say you have the following code:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Ignoring that there are better ways to write this example
(<code>total = sum(obj.member)</code> should work), as written, the loop
here will need to resolve <code>obj.member</code> on every iteration.
Python has a relatively complex mechanism for
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">resolving attributes</a>.
For simple types, it can be quite fast. But for complex types,
that attribute access can silently be invoking <code>__getattr__</code>,
<code>__getattribute__</code>, various other <em>dunder</em> methods, and even
custom <code>@property</code> functions. What looks like it should be
a fast attribute lookup can silently be several function calls,
leading to function call overhead! And this overhead can compound
if you are doing things like <code>obj.member1.member2.member3</code> etc.</p>
<p>Each attribute lookup adds overhead. And since nearly everything
in Python is a dictionary, it is somewhat accurate to equate
each attribute lookup as a dictionary lookup. And we know from
basic data structures that dictionary lookups are intrinsically not
as fast as having say a pointer. Yes, there are some tricks in
CPython to avoid the dictionary lookup overhead. But the general
theme I want to get across is that each attribute lookup is a
potential performance sink.</p>
<p>For tight loops - especially those over potentially hundreds of
thousands of iterations - you can avoid this measurable attribute
lookup overhead by aliasing the value to a local. We would write the
example above as:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="n">member</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, this is only safe when the aliased item isn't
replaced inside the loop! If that happens, your iterator will
hold a reference to the old item and things may blow up.</p>
<p>The same trick can be used when calling a method of an object.
Instead of:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Do the following:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">:)</span>
    <span class="n">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's also worth noting that in cases where the attribute lookup
is used to call a method (such as the previous example),
Python 3.7 is
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue26110">significantly faster</a>
than previous releases. But I'm pretty sure this is due to
dispatch overhead to the method function itself, not attribute
lookup overhead. So things will be faster yet by avoiding the
attribute lookup.</p>
<p>Finally, unless attribute lookup is calling functions to
resolve the attribute, attribute lookup is generally less of
a problem than function call overhead. And it generally requires
eliminating a lot of attribute lookups for you to notice a
meaningful improvement. That being said, once you add up all
attribute accesses inside a loop, you may be talking about
10 or 20 attributes in the loop alone - before function calls.
And loops with only thousands or low tens of thousands of iterations
can quickly provide hundreds of thousands or millions of attribute
lookups. So be on the lookout!</p>
<h2>Object Overhead</h2>
<p>From the perspective of the Python interpreter, every value is
an object. In CPython, each value is a <code>PyObject</code> struct. Each
object managed by the interpreter is on the heap and needs to have
its own memory holding its reference count, its type, and other
state. Every object is garbage collected. This means that each
new object introduces overhead for the reference counting / garbage
collection mechanism to process. (Again, PyPy can avoid some of
this overhead by being more intelligent about the <em>lifetimes</em> of
short-lived values.)</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the more unique Python values/objects
you create, the slower things are.</p>
<p>For example, say you are iterating over a collection of 1 million
objects. You call a function to process that object into a tuple:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_collection</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>process()</code> returns an <code>8-tuple</code>. It doesn't
matter of we destructure the return value or not: this tuple requires
the creation of at least 9 Python values: 1 for the tuple itself
and 8 for its inner members. OK, in reality there could be fewer
values if <code>process()</code> returns a reference to an existing value.
Or there could be more if the types aren't simple types and require
multiple <code>PyObject</code> to represent. My point is that under the hood
the interpreter is having to juggle multiple objects to represent
things.</p>
<p>From my experience, this overhead is only relevant for operations
that benefit from speedups when implemented in a native language
like C or Rust. The reason is the CPython interpreter is just
unable to execute bytecode fast enough for object overhead itself
to matter. Instead, you will likely hit performance issues with
function call overhead, processing overhead, etc long before
object overhead. But there are some exceptions to this, such as
constructing tuples or dicts with several members.</p>
<p>As a concrete example of this overhead, Mercurial has C code for
parsing some of the lower-level data structures. In terms of
raw parsing speed, the C code runs on an order of two magnitudes
faster than CPython. But once we have that C code create
<code>PyObject</code> to present the result, the speedup drops to just a
few times faster, if that. In other words, the overhead is coming
from creating and managing Python values so they can be used
by Python code.</p>
<p>A workaround for this is to produce fewer Python values. If you
only need to access a single value, have a function return that
single value instead of say a tuple or dict with N values. However,
watch out for function call overhead!</p>
<p>When you have a lot of speedup code using the CPython C API and
values need to be shared across different modules, pass around Python
types that expose data as C structs and have the compiled code
access those C structs instead of going through the CPython
C API. By avoiding the Python C API for data access, you will
be avoiding most of its overhead.</p>
<p>Treating values as data (instead of having functions for accessing
everything) is more Pythonic. So another workaround for compiled
code is is to lazily create
<code>PyObject</code> instances. If you create a custom Python
type (<code>PyTypeObject</code>) to represent your complex values, you
can define the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_members">tp_members</a>
and/or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_getset">tp_getset</a>
fields to register custom C functions to resolve the value for
an attribute. If you are say writing a parser and you know that
consumers will only access a subset of the parsed fields, you can
quickly construct a type holding the raw data, return that type,
and have the Python attribute lookup call a C function which
resolves the <code>PyObject</code>. You can even defer parsing until this
function is called, saving additional overhead if a parse is
never required! This technique is quite rare (because it requires
writing a non-trivial amount of code against the Python C API).
But it can result in substantial wins.</p>
<h2>Pre-Sizing Collections</h2>
<p>This one applies to the CPython C API.</p>
<p>When creating collections like lists or dicts, use e.g.
<code>PyList_New()</code> + <code>PyList_SET_ITEM()</code> to populate new
collections when their size is known at collection creation
time. This will pre-size the collection to have capacity to hold
the final number of elements. And it skips checks when inserting
elements that the collection is large enough to hold them. When
creating collections of thousands of elements, this can save a
bit of overhead!</p>
<h2>Using Zero-copy in the C API</h2>
<p>The CPython C API really likes to make copies of things rather
than return references. For example,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/bytes.html#c.PyBytes_FromStringAndSize">PyBytes_FromStringAndSize()</a>
copies a <code>char*</code> to memory <em>owned</em> by Python. If you are doing
this for a large number of values or sufficiently large data,
we could be talking about gigabytes of memory I/O and associated
allocator overhead.</p>
<p>If writing high-performance code against the C API, you'll want
to become familiar with the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/buffer.html">buffer protocol</a>
and related types, like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/memoryview.html">memoryview</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>buffer protocol</em> is implemented by Python types and allows
the Python interpreter to <em>cast</em> a type to/from bytes. It essentially
allows the interpreter's C code to get a handle on a
<code>void*</code> of certain size representing the object. This allows you
to associate any address in memory with a <code>PyObject</code>. Many
functions operating on binary data transparently accept any
object implementing the <em>buffer protocol</em>. And if you are coding
against the C API and want to accept any object that can be
treated as bytes, you should be using the
<code>s*</code>, <code>y*</code> or <code>w*</code>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#strings-and-buffers">format units</a>
when parsing function arguments.</p>
<p>By using the buffer protocol, you give the interpreter the
best opportunity possible to be using zero-copy operations and
avoiding having to copy bytes around in memory.</p>
<p>By using Python types like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a>,
you are also allowing Python to reference slices of memory by
reference instead of by copy.</p>
<p>When you have gigabytes of data flowing through your Python
program, astute use of Python types that support zero-copy can
make a world of difference on performance. I once measured
that <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">python-zstandard</a>
was faster than some Python LZ4 bindings (LZ4 should be faster
than zstandard) because I made heavy use of the buffer protocol
and avoiding excessive memory I/O in python-zstandard!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post has outlined some of the things I've learned optimizing
Python programs over the years. This post is by no means
a comprehensive overview of Python performance techniques and
gotchas. I recognize that my use of Python is probably more
demanding than most and that the recommendations I made are
not applicable to many Python programs. <strong>You should not
mass update your Python code to e.g. inline functions and
remove attribute lookups after reading this post.</strong> As always,
when it comes to performance optimization, measure first and
optimize where things are observed to be slow. I highly recommend
<a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy">py-spy</a> for profiling Python
applications. That being said, it's hard to attach a time value
to low-level activity in the Python interpreter such as calling
functions and looking up attributes. So if you e.g. have a loop 
that you know is tight, experiment with suggestions in this post,
and see if you can measure an improvement!</p>
<p>Finally this post should not be interpreted as a dig against Python
or its performance properties. Yes, you can make arguments that
Python should or shouldn't be used in particular areas because of
performance properties. But Python is extremely versatile -
especially with PyPy delivering exceptional performance for a
dynamic programming language. The performance of Python is probably
<em>good enough</em> for most people. For better or worse, I have used
Python for uses cases that often feel like outliers across all
users. And I wanted to share my experiences such that others
know what life at the frontier is like. And maybe, just maybe, I
can cause the smart people who actually maintain Python distributions
to think about the issues I've had in more detail and provide
improvements to mitigate them.</p>
