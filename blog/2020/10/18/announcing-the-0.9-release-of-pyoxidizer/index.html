  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have decided to make up for the 6 month lull between PyOxidizer's
0.7 and 0.8 releases by releasing
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/">PyOxidizer</a> 0.9 just 1 week
after 0.8!</p>
<p>The full 0.9 changelog is found
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/history.html#version-0-9-0">in the docs</a>.
First time user? See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
documentation.</p>
<p>While the 0.9 release is far smaller in terms of features compared to 0.8,
it is an important release because of progress closing compatibility gaps.</p>
<h2>Build a <code>python</code> Executable</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 quietly shipped the ability to build executables that
behave like <code>python</code> executables via enhancements to the configurability of
embedded Python interpreters.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.9 made some minor changes to make this scenario work better
and there is even
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/packaging_python_executable.html">official documentation</a>
on how to achieve this. So now you can emit a <code>python</code> executable next to your
application's executable. Or you could use PyOxidizer to build a highly portable,
self-contained <code>python</code> executable and ship your Python scripts next to it,
using PyOxidizer's <code>python</code> in your <code>#!</code>.</p>
<h2>Support Packaging Files as Files for Maximum Compatibility</h2>
<p>There is a long-tail of Python packages that don't <em>just work</em> with
PyOxidizer. A subset of these packages don't work because of bugs with how
PyOxidizer attempts to classify files as specific types of Python resources.</p>
<p>The way that normal Python works is you materialize a bunch of files on
the filesystem and at run-time the filesystem-based importer <code>stat()</code>s a
bunch of paths until it finds a candidate file satisfying the <code>import</code>
request. This works of course. But it is inefficient. Since PyOxidizer has
awareness of every resource being packaged at build time, it attempts to
index all known resources and serialize them to an efficient data structure
so finding and loading a resource can be extremely quick (effectively just a
hashmap lookup in Rust code to resolve the memory address of data).</p>
<p>PyOxidizer's approach does work in the majority of cases. But there are
edge cases. For example, NumPy's binary wheels have installed file paths
like <code>numpy.libs/libopenblasp-r0-ae94cfde.3.9.dev.so</code>. The <code>numpy.libs</code>
directory is not a valid Python package directory since it has a <code>.</code> and
since it doesn't have an <code>__init__.py[c]</code> file. This is a case where
PyOxidizer's code for turning files into <em>resources</em> is currently confused.</p>
<p>It is tempting to argue that file layouts like NumPy's are <em>wrong</em>. But
there doesn't seem to be any formal specification preventing the use of
such layouts. The arbiter of truth here is what Python packaging tools
accept and the current code for installing <em>wheels</em> gladly accepts file
layouts like these. So I've accepted that PyOxidizer is just going to have
to support edge cases like this. (I've captured more details about this
particular issue
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/technotes.html#ambiguous-file-classification">in the docs</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, PyOxidizer 0.9 ships a new, simpler mode for handling files:
<em>files mode</em>. In <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/packaging_resources.html#classified-resources-versus-files">files mode</a>,
PyOxidizer disables its code for <em>classifying</em> files as typed Python
resources (like module sources and extension modules) and instead treats
a file as... a file.</p>
<p>When in files mode, actions that invoke Python packaging tools return
files objects instead of classified resources. If you then add these files
for packaging, those files are materialized on the filesystem next to your
built executable. You can then use Python's standard filesystem importer
to load these files at run-time.</p>
<p>This allows you to use PyOxidizer with packages like NumPy that were
previously incompatible due to bugs with file/resource classification.
In fact, getting NumPy working with PyOxidizer is
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/packaging_additional_files.html#installing-unclassified-files-on-the-filesystem">now in the official documentation</a>!</p>
<p><em>Files mode</em> is still in its infancy. There exists code for embedding
files data in the produced executable. I plan to eventually teach PyOxidizer's
run-time code to extract these embedded files to a temporary directory,
SquashFS FUSE filesystem, etc. This is the approach that other Python
packaging tools like PyInstaller and XAR use. While it is less efficient, this
approach is highly compatible with Python code in the wild since you sidestep
issues with <code>__file__</code> and other assumptions about installed file layouts. So
it makes sense for PyOxidizer to provide support for this so you can still
achieve the friendliness of a self-contained executable without worrying
about compatibility. Look for improvements to <em>files mode</em> in future releases.</p>
<p>And to help debug issues with PyOxidizer's file handling and resource
classification, the new
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/managing_projects.html#debugging-resource-scanning-and-identification-with-find-resources">pyoxidizer find-resources</a>
command can be used to invoke PyOxidizer's code for scanning and classifying
files. Hopefully this makes it easier to diagnose bugs in this critical
component of PyOxidizer!</p>
<h2>Some Important Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 shipped with some pretty annoying bugs and behavior quirks.</p>
<p>The ability to set custom <code>sys.path</code> values via Starlark was broken. How I
managed to ship that, I'm not sure. But it is fixed in 0.9.</p>
<p>Another bug I can't believe I shipped was
the <code>PythonExecutable.read_virtualenv()</code> Starlark method being broken due to
a typo. You can read from virtualenvs again in PyOxidizer 0.9.</p>
<p>Another important improvement is in the default Python interpreter
configuration. We now automatically initialize Python's locales configuration
by default. Without this, the encoding of filesystem paths and <code>sys.argv</code> may
not have been correct. If someone passed a non-ASCII argument, the Python <code>str</code>
value was likely mangled. PyOxidizer built binaries should behave reasonably
by default now. The <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/294">issue</a>
is a good read if the subtle behaviors of how encodings work in Python and on
different operating systems is interesting to you.</p>
<h2>Better Binary Portability Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation on
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/packaging_binary_compatibility.html">binary portability</a>
has been overhauled. Hopefully it is much more clear about the capabilities
of PyOxidizer to produce a binary that <em>just works</em> on other machines.</p>
<p>I eventually want to get PyOxidizer to a point where users don't have to
think about binary portability. But until PyOxidizer starts generating
installers and providing the ability to run builds in deterministic and
reproducible environments, it is sadly a problem that is being externalized
to end users.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.9 is a small release representing just 1 week of work. But
it contains some notable features that I wanted to get out the door.</p>
<p>As always, please report any issues or feedback in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/new">GitHub issue tracker</a>
or the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyoxidizer-users">users mailing list</a>.</p>
