  <p>The <a href="/blog/2019/06/24/building-standalone-python-applications-with-pyoxidizer/">initial release</a>
of PyOxidizer generated a bit of excitement across the Internet! The post was
commented on heavily in various forums and my phone was constantly buzzing from
all the Twitter activity. There has been a steady stream of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">GitHub Issues</a> for the project,
which I consider a good sign. So thank you everybody for the support and
encouragement! And especially thank you to everyone who filed an issue or
submitted a pull request!</p>
<p>While I don't usually read the comments, I was looking at various forums
posting about PyOxidizer to see what reactions were like. A common negative
theme was the lack of C extension support in PyOxidizer. People seemed
dismissive of PyOxidizer because it didn't support C extensions. Despite the
documentation stating that the feature was planned and that I had an idea for
how to implement it, people seemed pessimistic. Perhaps I didn't adequately
communicate that making C extensions work is actually a subset of the
already-solved <em>single file executable</em> problem and therefore was already
a <em>solved problem</em> at the technical level (only the integration with the
Python and PyOxidizer <em>build systems</em> was missing). So in my mind C
extension support was only a matter of time and the only open question was
how many hacks would be needed to make it work, not <em>whether</em> it would work.</p>
<p>Well, I'm pleased to report that <strong>the just-released version 0.2 of PyOxidizer
supports C extensions on Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>. If you install a Python
package through a <code>pip-install-simple</code>, <code>pip-requirements-file</code>, or
<code>setup-py-install</code> packaging rule, C extensions will be compiled in a special
way that enables them to be embedded in the same binary containing Python
itself. I've tested it with the <code>zope.interface</code>, <code>zstandard</code>, and
<code>mercurial</code> packages and it seems to work (although Mercurial has other
issues that prevent it from being packaged as a PyOxidizer application - but
the C extensions do compile).</p>
<p>There are some
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html#native-extension-modules">limitations</a>
to the support, however. I'm pretty confident the limitations can be eliminated
given enough time. Given how many people were hung up on the lack of C extensions
and were seemingly writing off PyOxidizer thinking it was snake oil or something,
I wanted to deliver basic C extension support to curtail this line of criticism.
Perfect is the enemy of good and hopefully basic C extension support is good
enough to ease concerns about PyOxidizer's viability.</p>
<p>Also in PyOxidizer 0.2 are some minor new features, like the <code>--pip-install</code> and
<code>--python-code</code> flags to <code>pyoxidizer init</code>. These allow you to generate a
<code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file pre-configured to install some packages from pip and run
custom Python code. So now applications can be created and built with a one-liner
without having to edit a <code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file!</p>
<p>The full release notes <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html">are available</a>.
As always, please keep
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>. I'm particularly
interested in hearing about packages whose C extensions don't work properly.</p>

  <p>Python application distribution is generally considered an unsolved
problem. At their PyCon 2019 keynote talk, Russel Keith-Magee
<a href="https://youtu.be/ftP5BQh1-YM?t=2033">identified code distribution</a> as
a potential <em>black swan</em> - an existential threat for longevity - for
Python. In their words, <em>Python hasn't ever had a consistent story for
how I give my code to someone else, especially if that someone else
isn't a developer and just wants to use my application.</em> I completely
agree. And I want to add my opinion that unless your target user is a
Python developer, they shouldn't need to know anything about Python
packaging, Python itself, or even the existence of Python in order to
use your application. (And you can replace <em>Python</em> in the previous
sentence with any programming language or software technology: most
end-users don't care about the technical implementation, they just
want to get stuff done.)</p>
<p>Today, I'm excited to announce the first release of PyOxidizer
(<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">project</a>,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>), an open
source utility that aims to solve the Python application distribution
problem! (The installation instructions are in the docs.)</p>
<h2>Standalone Single File, No Dependencies Executable Python Applications</h2>
<p><strong>PyOxidizer's marquee feature is that it can produce a single file
executable containing a fully-featured Python interpreter, its
extensions, standard library, and your application's modules and
resources.</strong> In other words, you can have a single <code>.exe</code> providing
your application. And unlike other tools in this space which tend to
be operating system specific, PyOxidizer works across platforms
(currently Windows, macOS, and Linux - the most popular platforms for
Python today). Executables built with PyOxidizer have minimal
dependencies on the host environment nor do they do anything
complicated at run-time. I believe PyOxidizer is the only open
source tool to have all these attributes.</p>
<p><strong>On Linux, it is possible to build a fully statically linked executable.</strong>
You can drop this executable into a chroot or container where it is the
only file and it will <em>just work</em>. On macOS and Windows, the only
library dependencies are on always-present or extremely common
libraries. More details are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributing.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>At execution time, binaries built with PyOxidizer do not do anything
special to run the Python interpreter. (Other tools in this space do
things like create a temporary directory or SquashFS filesystem and
extract Python to it.) <strong>PyOxidizer loads everything from memory and there
is no explicit I/O being performed. When you <code>import</code> a Python module,
the bytecode for that module is being loaded from a memory address in
the executable using zero-copy.</strong> This makes PyOxidizer executables
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#faster-python-programs">faster</a>
to start and <code>import</code> - faster than a <code>python</code> executable itself!</p>
<h2>Current Release and Future Roadmap</h2>
<p>Today's release of PyOxidizer is just the first release milestone in
what I envision is a long and successful project history. While my
over-arching goal with PyOxidizer is to <em>solve</em> vast swaths of the
Python application distribution problem, I want to be clear that this
first release comes nowhere close to doing so. I toiled with what
features <em>must</em> be in the initial release. I ultimately decided that
PyOxidizer's current functionality is extremely valuable to <em>some</em>
audiences and that the project has matured to the point where more
eyeballs and users would substantially help its development. (I could
definitely use some help prioritizing which features to work on and
for that I need users and user feedback.)</p>
<p>In today's release, PyOxidizer is good at producing executables
embedding Python. It doesn't yet venture too far into the <em>distribution</em>
part of the problem (I want it to be trivial to produce MSI installers,
DMG images, deb/rpm packages, etc). But on Linux, this is already a huge
step forward because PyOxidizer makes it easy (hopefully!) to produce
binaries that should <em>just work</em> on other machines. (Anyone who has
attempted to distribute Linux applications will tell you how painful this
problem can be.)</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, I believe today's release of PyOxidizer to
be a viable tool for some applications. And I believe PyOxidizer can
start to replace existing tools in this space. (See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparisons.html">Comparisons to Other Tools</a>
document for how PyOxidizer compares to other Python packaging and
distribution tools.)</p>
<p>Using today's release of PyOxidizer, larger user-facing applications
using Python (like Dropbox, <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>,
<a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a>, etc) could use
PyOxidizer to produce self-contained executables. This would likely cut
down on installer size, decrease install/update time (fewer files means
faster operations), and hopefully make packaging simpler for application
maintainers. Maintainers of Python utilities could produce self-contained
executables, making their utilities faster to start and easier to
package and distribute.</p>
<h2>New Possibilities and Reliability for Python</h2>
<p>By enabling support for self-contained, single file Python applications,
PyOxidizer opens exciting new doors for Python. Because Python has
historically required an explicit, separate runtime not part of the
executable, Python was not viable (or was a hinderance) in many domains.
For example, if you wanted to use Python to <em>bootstrap</em> a fresh server
or empty container environment, you had a chicken-and-egg problem because
you needed to install Python before you could use it.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> for example. One of Ansible's
features is that it remotes into a machine and runs things. The way
it does this is it dynamically generates Python scripts locally, uploads
them to the remote machine, and tells the remote to execute them. Those
Python scripts require the existence of a Python interpreter on the
remote machine. This means you need to install Python on a machine before
you can control it with Ansible. Furthermore, because the remote's Python
isn't under Ansible's control, you can assume very little about its behavior
and capabilities, making interaction a bit brittle.</p>
<p>Using PyOxidizer, projects like Ansible could produce a self-contained
executable containing a Python interpreter. They could transfer that
single binary to the remote machine and execute it, instantly giving the
remote machine access to a fully-featured and modern Python interpreter.
From there, the sky is the limit. In Ansible's case, the executable could
contain the full Ansible runtime, along with any 3rd party Python
packages they wanted to leverage. This would allow execution to occur
(possibly mostly independently) on the remote machine. This architecture
is simpler, scales better, would likely result in faster operations, and
would probably improve the quality of life for everyone involved, from
application developers to its end users.</p>
<p><strong>Self-contained Python applications built with PyOxidizer essentially
solve the <em>Python interpreter bootstrapping and reliability</em> problems.</strong>
By providing a Python interpreter and a known set of Python modules, you
provide a highly deterministic and reliable execution environment for your
application. You don't need to fret about which version of Python
is installed: you <em>know</em> which version of Python you are using.
You don't need to worry about which Python packages are installed:
you control explicitly which packages are available. You don't need to
worry about whether you are running in a virtualenv, what <code>sys.path</code>
is set to, whether <code>.pth</code> files come into play, whether various
<code>PYTHON*</code> environment variables can mess up your application, whether
some Linux distribution packaged Python differently, what to put in your
script's <em>shebang</em>, etc: executables built with PyOxidizer behave as
you have instructed them to because they are <em>compiled</em> that way.</p>
<p>All of the concerns in the previous paragraph contribute to a larger
problem in the eyes of application maintainers that can be summarized as
<em>Python isn't reliable</em>. And because <em>Python isn't reliable</em>, many
people reach the conclusion that <em>Python shouldn't be used</em> (this is the
<em>black swan</em> that was referred to earlier). With PyOxidizer, the Python
environment is isolated and highly deterministic making the
reliability problem largely go away. This makes Python a more viable
technology choice. And it enables application maintainers to aggressively
adopt modern Python versions, utilize third party packages fearlessly,
and spend far less time chasing an extremely long tail of issues related
to Python environment variance. Succinctly, application developers can
focus on building great applications instead of toiling with Python
environment problems.</p>
<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer is still in its relative infancy. While it is far from
feature complete, I'm mentally committed to working on the remaining
major functionality. The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html">Status</a>
document lists major missing functionality, lesser missing functionality,
and potential future value-add functionality.</p>
<p>I want PyOxidizer to provide a Python application packaging and
distribution experience that <em>just works</em> with minimal cognitive effort
from Python application maintainers. I have spent a lot of effort
documenting PyOxidizer. I care passionately about user experience and want
everything about PyOxidizer to be simple and frustration free. I
know things aren't there yet. The problems that PyOxidizer is attempting
to solve are hard (that's a reason nobody has solved them well yet). I
know there's details floating around in my head that haven't been
added to the documentation yet. I know there's missing features and
bugs in PyOxidizer. I know there are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_pitfalls.html">Packaging Pitfalls</a>
yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to make PyOxidizer great.</strong> I encourage Python
application maintainers reading this to head over to
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
and the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging.html">Packaging User Guide</a>
and try to package your applications with PyOxidizer. If things don't
work, let me know by <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing an issue</a>.
If you are confused by lack of or unclear documentation, file an issue.
If something frustrates you, file an issue. If you want to suggest I
work on a certain feature or fix a bug, file an issue! Tweet to
<a href="https://twitter.com/indygreg">@indygreg</a> to engage with me there. Join
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyoxidizer-users">pyoxidizer-users mailing list</a>.
While I feel PyOxidizer is usable today (that's why I'm announcing it),
<strong>I need your feedback to help guide future prioritization.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I know PyOxidizer has significant implications for some
companies and projects that use Python. While I'm not looking to
enrich myself or make my livelihood from PyOxidizer, if PyOxidizer is
useful to you and you'd like to send money my way as appreciation, you
can do so <a href="https://www.patreon.com/indygreg">on Patreon</a> or
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=gregory%2eszorc%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=PyOxidizer&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted">PayPal</a>.
If not, that's totally fine: I wouldn't be making PyOxidizer open source
if I didn't want to share it with the world for free! And I am
financially well off as well. I just feel like there should be
more financial contribution to open source because it would improve
the health of the ecosystem and I can help achieve that end by
advocating for it and giving myself.</p>
<h2>Leveraging Rust</h2>
<p>The <em>oxidize</em> part of PyOxidizer comes from Rust (See the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust">Wikipedia Rust article</a> - for the
chemical not the programming language - to understand where <em>oxidize</em>
comes from.) The build time packaging and building functionality is
implemented in Rust. And the binary that embeds and controls the
Python interpreter in built applications is Rust code. Rationale for
these decisions is
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-rust">explained in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first non-toy project using Rust and I have to say that
Rust is... incredible! I may have to author a dedicated blog post
extolling the virtues of Rust. In short, Rust is now my go-to language
for systems level projects. Unless you need the target platform
versatility, I don't think C or C++ are defensibles choices in 2019 given
their security deficiencies. Languages like Go, Java, and various JVM
or CLR languages are acceptable if you can tolerate having a garbage
collector and/or a larger runtime. But what makes Rust superior in my
mind is the ability for the compiler to prevent large classes of
software bugs (especially those that turn into CVEs) and inefficiencies that
have plagued our industry for decades. <strong>Rust is the first programming
language I've used where I feel like the language itself, the compiler,
the tools around it (cargo, rustfmt, clippy, rustup, etc), and the
community surrounding it all actually care about and assist me with
writing high quality software. Nothing else I've used comes even close.</strong></p>
<p>What I've been most surprised about Rust is how high level it feels
for a systems level language that isn't garbage collected. When you
program lower-level languages like C or C++, compared to a higher level
language like Python, you have to type a lot more and be more explicit
in nearly everything you do. While Rust is certainly not as expressive
or compact as say Python, it is far, far closer to Python than I was
expecting it to be. Yes, you do have to type more and think more about
your code to appease the Rust compiler's constraints. But the return
on that investment is the compiler preventing entire classes of bugs
and C/C++ levels of performance. When I started PyOxidizer, the build
time logic was implemented in Python and only the run-time pieces were
in Rust. <strong>After learning a bit more Rust and realizing the obvious
code quality benefits, I ditched Python and adopted Rust for the build
time logic.</strong> And as the code base has grown and gone through various
refactorings, I am so glad I did so! The Rust compiler has caught
dozens of would-be bugs in Python. Granted, many of these can be
attributed to having strong typing and compile time type checking and
Rust is little different than say Java on this front. But a significant
number of prevented bugs covered invariants in the code because of the
way Rust's type system often intersects with control flow. e.g. <code>match</code>
arms must be exhaustive, so you can't have unhandled values/types and
unchecked <code>Result</code> instances result ina compiler warning. And clippy
has been just fantastic helping to guide me towards writing more
<em>acceptable</em> code following community accepted best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Even though PyOxidizer is implemented in Rust, most end-users shouldn't
have to care</strong> (beyond having to install a Rust compiler and build
PyOxidizer from source). The existence of Rust should be abstracted
away from Python packagers. I did this on purpose because I believe that
users of an application shouldn't have to care about the technical
implementation of that application. It is a bit unfortunate that I
force users to install Rust before using PyOxidizer, but in my defense
the target audience is technically savvy developers, bootstrapping Rust
is easy, and PyOxidizer is young, so I think it is acceptble for now.
If people get hung up on it, I can provide pre-compiled <code>pyoxidizer</code>
executables.</p>
<p>But if you do know Rust, PyOxidizer being implemented in Rust opens
up some exciting possibilities!</p>
<p><strong>One exciting possibility with PyOxidizer is the ability to add Rust
code to your Python application.</strong> PyOxidizer works by generating a
default Rust application (<code>main.rs</code>) that simply instantiates and runs
an embedded Python interpreter then exits. It essentially does what
<code>python</code> or a Python script would do. The key takeaway here is your
<em>Python application</em> is technically a <em>Rust application</em> (in the same
way that <code>python</code> is technically a <em>C application</em>). And being a
Rust application means you can add Rust code to that application. You
can modify the autogenerated <code>main.rs</code> to do things before, during, and
after the embedded Python interpreter runs. It's a regular Rust program
and can do anything that Rust programs can do!</p>
<p>Another possibility - and variant of above - is embedding Python
in existing Rust projects. PyOxidizer's mechanism for embedding a
Python interpreter is implemented as a standalone Rust crate. <strong>One
can add the pyembed crate to an existing Rust project and a little of
build system magic later, your Rust project can now embed and run
a Python interpreter!</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of potential for hybrid Rust + Python programs. And
I am <strong>very</strong> excited about the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a Rust programmer, PyOxidizer allows you to easily embed
Python in your Rust application. If you are a Python programmer,
PyOxidizer allows your to easily leverage Rust in your Python
application.</strong> In short, the package ecosystem of the other becomes
available to you. And if you aren't familiar with Rust, there are some
potentially crazy possibilities. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is a GPU accelerated
terminal emulator written in Rust and
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> is an entire web browser
engine written in Rust. With PyOxidizer, you could integrate a
terminal emulator or browser engine as part of your Python
application if you really wanted to. And, yes, Rust's packaging
tools are so good that stuff like this tends to <em>just work</em>. As
a concrete example, the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool contains <code>libgit2</code>
for performing in-process interactions with Git repositories. Adding
this required a single line change to a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and it
<em>just worked</em> on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Stuff like this often
takes hours to days to integrate in C/C++. It is quite ridiculous
how easy it is to add (complex) components to Rust projects!</p>
<p>For years, Python projects have implemented extensions in C to
realize performance wins. If your Python application is a Rust
executable, then implementing this functionality in Rust (rather
than C) seems rationale. So we may see <em>oxidized</em> Python
applications have their performance critical pieces slowly be
rewritten in Rust. (Honestly, the Rust crates to interface between
Rust and the CPython API still leave a bit to be desired, so the
experience of writing this Rust code still isn't great. But things
will certainly improve over time.)</p>
<p>This type of <em>inside-out</em> split language work has been practiced
in Python for years. What PyOxidizer brings to the table is the
ability to more easily port code <em>outside-in</em>. For example, you
could implement performance-criticial, early application logic such
as config file parsing and command line argument parsing in Rust.
You could then have Rust service some application functionality
without Python. Why would you want this? Performance is a valid
reason. Starting a Python interpreter, importing modules, and running
code can consume several dozen or even hundreds of milliseconds. If
you are writing performance sensitive applications, the existence
of <em>any</em> Python can add enough latency that people no longer perceive
the interaction as instananeous. This added latency can make Python
totally inappropriate for some contexts, such as for programs that run
as part of populating your shell's prompt. Writing such code in Rust
instead of Python dramatically increases the probability that the
code is fast and likely delivers stronger correctness guarantees
courtesy of Rust's compile time validation as well!</p>
<p>An extreme practice of <em>outside-in</em> porting of Python to Rust would
be to incrementally rewrite an entire Python application in Rust.
Rust's ergonomics are exceptional and I do think we'll see people
choose Rust where they previously would have chosen Python. I've
done this myself with PyOxidizer and feel it is a very defensible
decision to reach! I feel a bit conflicted releasing a tool which
may undermine Python's popularity by encouraging use of Rust over
Python. But at the end of the day, PyOxidizer increases the utility
of both Python and Rust by giving each more readily accessible
access to the other and PyOxidizer improves the overall utility of
Python by improving the application distribution story. I have no
doubt PyOxidizer is a net benefit for the Python ecosystem, even if
it does help usher in more people choosing Rust over Python. If
I have an ulterior motive in developing PyOxidizer, it is to enable
Mercurial's official distribution to be a Rust executable and
for some functionality (like <code>hg status</code>) to be runnable without
Python (for performance reasons).</p>
<p>Another possible use of PyOxidizer is as a library. All the build time
functionality of PyOxidizer exists in a Rust crate. So, you can add
the <code>pyoxidizer</code> crate to your own Rust project and use its code to
do things like build a library containing Python, compile Python
source modules to bytecode, or walk a directory tree and find Python
resources within. The code is still heavily geared towards PyOxidizer
and there's no promise of API stability. But this potential for library
usage exists and if others want to experiment with building custom
Python binaries not using the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool, using PyOxidizer
as a library might save you a lot of time.</p>
<h2>Standalone Python Distributions</h2>
<p>One of the most time consuming parts of building PyOxidizer was
figuring out how to build self-contained Python distributions.
Typically, a Python build consists of a library, shared libraries for
various extension modules, shared libraries required by the prior
items, and a hodgepodge of other files, such as .py files implementing
the Python standard library. The
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
project was created to automate creating special builds of Python
which are self-contained and distributable. This requires doing
dirty things with build systems. But I don't want to inflict the
details on you here. What I do think is worth mentioning is how
those Python distributions are distributed. The output of the
build is a tarball containing the Python installation, build artifacts
that can be used to link a custom libpython, and a <code>PYTHON.json</code>
file describing the contents of the distribution. PyOxidizer reads
the <code>PYTHON.json</code> file and learns how it should interact with that
distribution. <strong>If you produce a Python distribution conforming to the
format that <code>python-build-standalone</code> defines, you can use that
Python with PyOxidizer.</strong></p>
<p>While I have no urgency to do so at this time, I could see a future
where this Python distribution format is standardized. Then maintainers
of various Python distributions (CPython, PyPy, etc) would independently
produce their own distributable artifacts conforming to this standard,
in turn allowing machine consumers of Python distributions (such as
PyOxidizer) to easily consume different Python distributions and do
interesting things with them. You could even imagine these Python
distribution archives being readily available as packages in your
system's package manager and their locations exposed via the
<code>sysconfig</code> Python module, making it easy for tools (like PyOxidizer)
to find and use them.</p>
<p>Over time, I could see PyOxidizer's functionality rolling up into
official packaging tools like <code>pip</code>, which would know how to consume
the distribution archives and produce an executable containing a
Python interpreter, required Python modules, etc.</p>
<p>Getting PyOxidizer's functionality rolled into official Python
packaging tools is likely years away (if it ever happens). But I think
standardizing a format describing a Python distribution and (optionally)
contains build artifacts that can be used to <em>repackage</em> it is a
prerequisite and would be a good place to start this journey. I would
certainly love for Python distributions (like CPython) to be in charge of
producing official <em>repackagable</em> distributions because this is not
something I want to be in the business of doing long term (I'm
lazy, less equipped to make the correct decisions, and there are
various trust and security concerns). And while I'm here, I am
definitely interested in upstreaming some of the
<code>python-build-standalone</code> functionality into the existing CPython
build system because coercing CPython's build system to produce
distributable binaries is currently a major pain and I'd love to enable
others to do this. I just haven't had time nor do I know if the patches
would be well received. If a CPython maintainer wants to get in
touch, I'd love to have a conversation!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started hacking on PyOxidizer in November 2018. After months
of chipping away at it, I think I finally have a useful utility
for some audiences. There's still a lot of missing features and
some rough edges. But the core functionality is there and I'm
convinced that PyOxidizer or its underlying technology could be
an integral part of solving Python's application distribution
<em>black swan</em> problem. I'm particularly proud of the hacks I
concocted to coerce Python into importing module bytecode from
memory using zero-copy. Those are documented in
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">this blog post</a>
and in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/master/pyoxidizer/src/pyembed/lib.rs">pyembed crate docs</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation</a>,
install PyOxidizer, and let me know how it goes by
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy <em>oxidizing</em> your Python applications!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As I write this, I'm hours away from starting to interview for full-time
jobs in the software field. I've spoken with a number of recruiters and
hiring managers and have received interview preparation materials from
a handful of companies, many of which you've probably heard of.</p>
<p>I was hoping things would have changed since I last seriously underwent
this endeavor ~7.5 years ago (I did interview periodically when I was at
Mozilla in order to test waters, keep my interview skills sharp, etc). But
it appears the industry is still generally fixated on algorithms and
data structures in interviews. <strong>The way algorithms and similar coding tricks
are emphasized in the preparation materials I've received, you'd think people
in software spend a major part of their work days thinking about and
implementing algorithms</strong>. But from my experience, this is very far from
the case! So why are so many companies and interviewers fixated on
algorithms. And is this a good thing?</p>
<p>When they matter, efficient algorithms, data structures, and other tricks
are important and useful skills to have. But from my experience, they
matter far less than you would think. If I were to make a list of important
job skills and traits for software and programming, memorized knowledge of
algorithms and data structures is so far down the list that I don't think I
would even ask about algorithms fundamentals for most job candidates! (In
fact I don't.) I think it is vastly more important to focus on behavioral
qualities and potential to actually think and apply knowledge rather than
regurgitate it. Algorithms and data structures, after all, are learned
knowledge. All other things be equal, I'd rather have someone who knows
when to ask for help with an algorithms issue or can pick up the skill
than a curmudgeon algorithms genius who has an abrasive personality and
clings to old habits.</p>
<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, I should to state that my algorithms skills
are relatively weak. You can accuse me of writing this post to fulfill my
own selfish interests. You wouldn't be wrong. But I know there are others
like me who are good at programming yet struggle with algorithms and question
the utility of algorithms in interviews. I'm attempting to write this post
for all of us. </p>
<p>I have failed job interviews because the interviewer assessed my algorithms
abilities as weak. I'm able to work through this <em>deficiency</em> with interviewers
who care more about the behavioral traits I exhibit when in such a situation (I
try to be quick about admitting my technical weaknesses and to ask for help
when needed). But some interviewers aren't as interested in the behavioral
traits or insist on a baseline level of memorized algorithms knowledge beyond
my own. I feel like my relative algorithms weakness hasn't hurt me <em>on</em> the
job, as I hardly find myself caring about algorithms in the work I do. In the
majority of cases, the choice of an algorithm just doesn't matter for the size
of the data set. Or a standard algorithm or data structure available in the
standard library of the language I'm using is <em>good enough</em>. In the cases where
I realize algorithms and data structures would matter, I run my
technical questions past someone with more knowledge in the domain than me. Or
if I don't do that, it often comes up during code review.
Without strong algorithms and data structures knowledge, I'm able to maintain
the Firefox build system, become a core contributor to a version control
tool (something you think would require a lot of heavy algorithms knowledge),
maintain various open source projects, diagnose and address low-level
performance issues in complex software and systems. <strong>About the only impact that
being weak in algorithms and data structures has had on my career is that some
companies passed on hiring me because they perceived strength in this area to
be important.</strong></p>
<p>Albert Einstein once said, <em>I never commit to memory anything that can
easily be looked up in a book.</em> A modern adaptation of that quote may
go something like, <em>never memorize how to implement an algorithm or data
structure when you can just Google it or use a software library
implementing it.</em> If you have knowledge of how to implement various algorithms
in your head, that's good for you, I suppose. But I think the <em>bigger brain</em>
knowledge to possess is <em>when</em> algorithms matter and to a lesser extent, what
types of algorithms are appropriate for particular problems. Answering these
problems requires critical thinking. Actually implementing algorithms, by
contrast, merely requires knowledge <em>that can easily be looked up in a book</em> (the
algorithm or data structure itself) coupled with some programming knowledge for
how to apply it. A capable programmer will be able to do both these things and
pick up algorithms and data structure knowledge on the job, if necessary.</p>
<p>Some would say that algorithms are a good way to flush out coding
ability. And coding ability is important to assess as part of interviewing
a job candidate for a programming position! They aren't wrong. But there
are much better ways to receive stronger signals about an interviewee's
compatibility! On the coding front, there are infinite ways to assess
programming capability without involving algorithms. So why involve
algorithms as part of the interview?</p>
<p>One way I approach interviewing people is to imagine what the typical
work day of that role will be like. How much time do they spend coding,
investigating bugs, debugging, attending meetings, writing proposals,
politicking with managers, etc. This produces a conceptual pie chart
of that role's activities. I then try to structure the interview such
that the topics covered in the interview correlate with and somewhat
in proportion to activities in that job role. Is the role a heads down
junior coder? A team lead or manager? When you start trying to map the
time in various areas of the role to time spent in the interview, you
realize that the common technical interview overly emphasizes some areas
and often completely ignores others! One of the areas that is
over-emphasizes is algorithms. <strong>Again, your typical programmer is going
to be spending most of their typical day doing things unrelated to
algorithms. So why are you spending precious interview time asking about
algorithms when you could be probing an area that actually correlates
to typical job activities?</strong> When viewed through this lens, the prevalence
of algorithms in interviews just doesn't make much sense to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps knowledge of algorithms should be basic knowledge that every
programmer should possess. If so, then asking about algorithms is fair
game during an interview, I suppose. But I'm not comfortable with this
line of thought.</p>
<p>I've always found it fascinating the ways that people with different
backgrounds and degrees approach problems differently. From my experience,
some of the best ideas and perspectives come from people with backgrounds
and degrees which are minorities in the field. I've worked with
programmers with degrees in philosophy and history who were some of the
best programmers and overall minds in the room. One of the great things
about software and programming is it is accessible to anyone, regardless
of background. If you can code, you can land a (usually high-paying) job.
Yes, the field is highly technical. But you don't need formal education
or a degree to enter it like you do similar <em>high-end</em> professions, such
as medicine or law. You can argue whether this is a good thing or not. But
I think the accessibility of the software profession - the lack of formal
gatekeeping - is something to marvel at, something that we as an industry
should embrace and be proud of. Do arbitrary hurdles to joining the
industry help or hinder it?</p>
<p>A problem with emphasizing algorithms in interviews is that algorithms
are somewhat highly specialized and academic. There are entire areas of
programming and software where detailed knowledge of algorithms just
isn't that important. <strong>The bar for so much software is <em>it works</em> and it
quite frankly doesn't matter if you have a quadratic algorithm instead of
something better.</strong></p>
<p>Most people I know are exposed to algorithms fundamentals during their
university education as part of pursuing a degree in
computer science or engineering. You almost certainly aren't going to
have academic exposure to algorithms if you are say a liberal arts
major - never mind someone who doesn't attend university at all (I also
know plenty of terrific programmers who don't have degrees). From my
own experience, my degree is in computer engineering. Not computer
science or software engineering: computer engineering. I remember from
my university days that my computer science friends seemed to have a much
better grasp at algorithms and theory of software and programming
than I did. When I was taking classes about how hardware and electronics
work, they were learning all about the mathematical concepts underpinning
the field, different approaches to programming language design, etc. I
received very little of that. And on top of that, I struggled with my
single algorithms course at university. So I entered the workforce without
as good of a grasp on the computer science fundamentals as others I knew.
(But I still probably knew more than someone in an unrelated field.)
The point I'm trying to make is that because algorithms are somewhat highly
specialized and academic in nature, requiring knowledge in algorithms
will effectively bias your hiring towards people with strong computer
science backgrounds. Stated another way, <strong>screening on algorithms knowledge
undermines diversity and inclusion initiatives by excluding viable
candidates who don't have strong backgrounds in computer science.</strong>
Sure, if someone wants to enter the industry they can take the time to
study up on algorithms. But why force them to do that? It feels like
arbitrary gatekeeping given the relative non-importance of algorithms
given the typical activities of the typical programmer. So why do it?</p>
<p>I suspect major contributing reasons to why algorithms are so prevalent
in interviews are cargo culting, laziness, and lack of formal interview
training / caring about diversity. As an industry, the software
field is pretty bad at applying best practices and learning from our
mistakes. I suspect this will change once the relatively young
industry catches up to more-established industries and we're forced to
cope with the realities of legal and monetary liabilities the way
practically every other industry is. (We're starting to see this with
monetary damages for security breaches.) Anyway, we as an industry are pretty
bad at self-regulating and adopting practices with proven benefits. We
like to settle for what is known. Laziness and the comfort associated with
is easy. Seeking out and implementing change is harder. This is human
nature. We see this with well-known people in industry rejecting the
ideas of continuous testing (years ago) or fuzzing (more recently). We see
it in C/C++ programmers who are delusional about their abilities to write
secure code and decry e.g. Rust's safety guarantees as superfluous. The
industry is disproportionately white and male (at least in the United
States). And this brings with it certain personality tendencies. One is a
<em>macho</em> attitude, which can manifest in interviews via the interviewer
embarking on an ego trip proving they know some esoteric algorithm or
data structure the candidate does not. </p>
<p>As a clear example of this, Google was known for asking <em>brainteaser</em>
interview questions. (The practice may have been prevalent at Microsoft
before Google was the darling of Silicon Valley, but that was before I
entered industry.) This <em>trend</em> caught on and soon companies all over were
asking brainteasers! The problem was that these questions
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-brainteasers-dont-belong-in-job-interviews">didn't correlate to actual job performance</a>!
From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=all">2013 NYTimes interview with Google's VP of People Operations</a>:</p>
<pre><code>On the hiring side, we found that brainteasers are a complete waste of
time. How many golf balls can you fit into an airplane? How many gas
stations in Manhattan? A complete waste of time. They don’t predict
anything. They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.
</code></pre>
<p>But the damage was done. I still heard these kinds of questions when
interviewing in the wild long after Google realized they were bad
questions and instructed interviewers not to ask them. I even believe I
got a brainteaser when interviewing at Google after the supposed
banning of these types of questions! And I won't be shocked if I'm
asked a brainteaser in 2019 as part of the several interviews I'll
be doing in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Asking questions with no correlation to job performance because a
popular company asked that type of question for a while: that's
textbook cargo culting. Failing to change your ways despite evidence
saying you should: laziness. Insisting that your way is correct and
others need to be like you: gatekeeping.</p>
<p>I'm not saying algorithms and data structures during interviews are
intrinsically bad and that we should stop asking about them. What I am
saying is that we as an industry need to examine how we interview. We need
to invest in scientifically proven techniques. (Research shows that
behavioral interview questions are <em>better</em>. <em>Tell me about a
time when</em>, etc.) And after more than ten years in industry, my experience
tells me that interviews place a disproportionate emphasis on algorithms
and data structures compared to the daily activities of the typical
programmer. And on top of that, due to their academic nature, I worry
that screening for algorithms and data structures knowledge is undermining
the diversity and inclusivity of our field by biasing towards people
with strong computer science backgrounds. I think it is time we
examine the role of algorithms and data structures in interviews and
consider focusing on other areas instead.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've used Python more than any other programming language in the past
4-5 years. Python is the lingua franca for Firefox's build, test, and
CI tooling. Mercurial is written in mostly Python. Many of my
side-projects are in Python.</p>
<p>Along the way, I've accrued a bit of knowledge about Python
performance and how to optimize Python. This post is about sharing
that knowledge with the larger community.</p>
<p>My experience with Python is mostly with the CPython interpreter,
specifically CPython 2.7. Not all observations apply to all Python
distributions or have the same characteristics across Python versions.
I'll try to call this out when relevant. And this post is in no
way a thorough survey of the Python performance landscape. I mainly
want to highlight areas that have particularly plagued me.</p>
<h2>Startup and Module Importing Overhead</h2>
<p>Starting a Python interpreter and importing Python modules is
relatively slow if you care about milliseconds.</p>
<p>If you need to start hundreds or thousands of Python processes
as part of a workload, this overhead will amount to several seconds
of overhead.</p>
<p>If you use Python to provide CLI tools, the overhead can cause
enough lag to be noticeable by people. If you want <em>instantaneous</em>
CLI tools, launching a Python interpreter on every invocation will
make it very difficult to achieve that with a sufficiently complex
tool.</p>
<p>I've written about this problem extensively. My
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-May/134528.html">2014 post on python-dev</a>
outlines the problem. Posts in
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-May/153296.html">May 2018</a>
and <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">October 2018</a>
restate and refine it.</p>
<p>There's not much you can do to alleviate interpreter startup overhead:
fixing this mostly resides with the maintainers of the Python
interpreter because they control the code that is taking precious
milliseconds to complete. About the best you can do is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id3">disable the site import</a>
in your shebangs and invocations to avoid some extra Python code
running at startup. However, many applications rely on functionality
provided by <code>site.py</code>, so use at your own risk.</p>
<p>Related to this is the problem of module importing. What good is a
Python interpreter if it doesn't have code to run! And the way code
is made available to the interpreter is often through importing
modules.</p>
<p>There are multiple steps to importing modules. And there are sources
of overhead in each one.</p>
<p>There is overhead in finding modules and reading their data. As
I've <a href="/blog/2019/01/06/pyoxidizer-support-for-windows/">demonstrated with PyOxidizer</a>,
replacing the default <em>find and load a module from the filesystem</em>
with an architecturally simpler solution of <em>read the module data
from an in-memory data structure</em> makes importing the Python standard
library take 70-80% of its original time! Having a single module
per filesystem file introduces filesystem overhead and can slow
down Python applications in the critical first milliseconds of
execution. Solutions like PyOxidizer can mitigate this. And hopefully
the Python community sees the overhead in the current approach
and considers moving towards module distribution mechanisms that
don't rely so much on separate files per module.</p>
<p>Another source of module importing overhead is executing code in
that module at import time. Some modules have code in the module
scope outside of functions and classes that runs when the module
is imported. This code execution can add overhead to importing. A
mitigation for this is to not run as much code at import time: only
run code as needed. Python 3.7 supports a module <code>__getattr__</code>
that will be called when a module attribute is not found. This can
be used to lazily populate module attributes on first access.</p>
<p>Another workaround for module importing slowness is lazy module
importing. Instead of actually loading a module when it is imported,
you register a custom module importer that returns a <em>stub</em> for
that module instead. When that stub is first accessed, it will
load the actual module and mutate itself to be that module.</p>
<p>By avoiding the filesystem and module running overhead for unused
modules (modules are typically imported globally and then only
used by certain functions in a module), you can easily shave
dozens of milliseconds from applications importing several dozens
of modules.</p>
<p>But lazy module importers are a bit fragile. Lots of modules
have a pattern where they <code>try: import foo; except ImportError:</code>.
A lazy module importer may never raise <code>ImportError</code> here because
to do so, it would need to search the filesystem for a module
to know if it exists and searching the filesystem would add overhead,
so they don't do it! You work around this by accessing an attribute
on the imported module. This forces the <code>ImportError</code> to be raised
if the module doesn't exist but undermines the laziness of the module
import! This problem is quite nasty. Mercurial's lazy module
importer has to maintain a list of modules that are known to not
be lazy importable to work around it. Another issue is the
<code>from foo import x, y</code> syntax, which also undermines lazy module
importing in cases where <code>foo</code> is a module (as opposed to a package)
because in order to return a reference to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the module
has to be imported.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer, having a fixed set of modules <em>frozen</em> into the binary,
can be efficient about raising <code>ImportError</code>. And Python 3.7's
module <code>__getattr__</code> provides additional flexibility for lazy
module importers. I hope to integrate a robust lazy module importer
into <code>PyOxidizer</code> so these gains are realized automatically.</p>
<p>The best solution to avoiding the interpreter startup and module
import overhead problem is to run a persistent Python process.
If you run Python in a daemon process (say for a web server), you
pretty much get this for free. Mercurial's solution to this is to
run a persistent Python process in the background which exposes a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer">command server</a>
protocol. <code>hg</code> is aliased to a C (or now Rust) executable
which connects to that persistent process and dispatches a
command. The command server approach is a lot of work and can
be a bit fragile and has security concerns. I'm exploring the
idea of shipping a command server with <code>PyOxidizer</code> so
executable can easily gain its benefits and the cost to solving
the problem only needs to be paid in one central place: the
<code>PyOxidizer</code> project.</p>
<h2>Function Call Overhead</h2>
<p>Function calls in Python are relatively slow. (This observation
applies less to PyPy, which can JIT code execution.)</p>
<p>I've seen literally dozens of patches to Mercurial where we inline
code or combine Python functions in order to avoid function
call overhead. In the current development cycle, some effort was
made to reduce the number of functions called when updating
progress bars. (We try to use progress bars for any operation
that could take a while so users know what is going on.) The
old progress bar update code would dispatch to a handful of
functions.
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/6603de284b0a">Caching function call results</a>
and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/963462786f6e">avoiding simple lookups via functions</a>
shaves dozens to hundreds of milliseconds off execution when we're
talking about 1 million executions.</p>
<p>If you have tight loops or recursive functions in Python where
hundreds of thousands or more function calls could be in play, you
need to be aware of the overhead of calling an individual function,
as it can add up quickly! Consider in-lining simple functions
and combining functions to avoid the overhead.</p>
<h2>Attribute Lookup Overhead</h2>
<p>This problem is similar to function call overhead because it
can actually be the same problem!</p>
<p>Resolving an attribute in Python can be relatively slow. (Again,
this observation applies less to PyPy.)</p>
<p>Again, working around this issue is something we do a lot in
Mercurial.</p>
<p>Say you have the following code:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Ignoring that there are better ways to write this example
(<code>total = sum(obj.member)</code> should work), as written, the loop
here will need to resolve <code>obj.member</code> on every iteration.
Python has a relatively complex mechanism for
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">resolving attributes</a>.
For simple types, it can be quite fast. But for complex types,
that attribute access can silently be invoking <code>__getattr__</code>,
<code>__getattribute__</code>, various other <em>dunder</em> methods, and even
custom <code>@property</code> functions. What looks like it should be
a fast attribute lookup can silently be several function calls,
leading to function call overhead! And this overhead can compound
if you are doing things like <code>obj.member1.member2.member3</code> etc.</p>
<p>Each attribute lookup adds overhead. And since nearly everything
in Python is a dictionary, it is somewhat accurate to equate
each attribute lookup as a dictionary lookup. And we know from
basic data structures that dictionary lookups are intrinsically not
as fast as having say a pointer. Yes, there are some tricks in
CPython to avoid the dictionary lookup overhead. But the general
theme I want to get across is that each attribute lookup is a
potential performance sink.</p>
<p>For tight loops - especially those over potentially hundreds of
thousands of iterations - you can avoid this measurable attribute
lookup overhead by aliasing the value to a local. We would write the
example above as:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="n">member</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, this is only safe when the aliased item isn't
replaced inside the loop! If that happens, your iterator will
hold a reference to the old item and things may blow up.</p>
<p>The same trick can be used when calling a method of an object.
Instead of:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Do the following:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">:)</span>
    <span class="n">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's also worth noting that in cases where the attribute lookup
is used to call a method (such as the previous example),
Python 3.7 is
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue26110">significantly faster</a>
than previous releases. But I'm pretty sure this is due to
dispatch overhead to the method function itself, not attribute
lookup overhead. So things will be faster yet by avoiding the
attribute lookup.</p>
<p>Finally, unless attribute lookup is calling functions to
resolve the attribute, attribute lookup is generally less of
a problem than function call overhead. And it generally requires
eliminating a lot of attribute lookups for you to notice a
meaningful improvement. That being said, once you add up all
attribute accesses inside a loop, you may be talking about
10 or 20 attributes in the loop alone - before function calls.
And loops with only thousands or low tens of thousands of iterations
can quickly provide hundreds of thousands or millions of attribute
lookups. So be on the lookout!</p>
<h2>Object Overhead</h2>
<p>From the perspective of the Python interpreter, every value is
an object. In CPython, each value is a <code>PyObject</code> struct. Each
object managed by the interpreter is on the heap and needs to have
its own memory holding its reference count, its type, and other
state. Every object is garbage collected. This means that each
new object introduces overhead for the reference counting / garbage
collection mechanism to process. (Again, PyPy can avoid some of
this overhead by being more intelligent about the <em>lifetimes</em> of
short-lived values.)</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the more unique Python values/objects
you create, the slower things are.</p>
<p>For example, say you are iterating over a collection of 1 million
objects. You call a function to process that object into a tuple:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_collection</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>process()</code> returns an <code>8-tuple</code>. It doesn't
matter of we destructure the return value or not: this tuple requires
the creation of at least 9 Python values: 1 for the tuple itself
and 8 for its inner members. OK, in reality there could be fewer
values if <code>process()</code> returns a reference to an existing value.
Or there could be more if the types aren't simple types and require
multiple <code>PyObject</code> to represent. My point is that under the hood
the interpreter is having to juggle multiple objects to represent
things.</p>
<p>From my experience, this overhead is only relevant for operations
that benefit from speedups when implemented in a native language
like C or Rust. The reason is the CPython interpreter is just
unable to execute bytecode fast enough for object overhead itself
to matter. Instead, you will likely hit performance issues with
function call overhead, processing overhead, etc long before
object overhead. But there are some exceptions to this, such as
constructing tuples or dicts with several members.</p>
<p>As a concrete example of this overhead, Mercurial has C code for
parsing some of the lower-level data structures. In terms of
raw parsing speed, the C code runs on an order of two magnitudes
faster than CPython. But once we have that C code create
<code>PyObject</code> to present the result, the speedup drops to just a
few times faster, if that. In other words, the overhead is coming
from creating and managing Python values so they can be used
by Python code.</p>
<p>A workaround for this is to produce fewer Python values. If you
only need to access a single value, have a function return that
single value instead of say a tuple or dict with N values. However,
watch out for function call overhead!</p>
<p>When you have a lot of speedup code using the CPython C API and
values need to be shared across different modules, pass around Python
types that expose data as C structs and have the compiled code
access those C structs instead of going through the CPython
C API. By avoiding the Python C API for data access, you will
be avoiding most of its overhead.</p>
<p>Treating values as data (instead of having functions for accessing
everything) is more Pythonic. So another workaround for compiled
code is is to lazily create
<code>PyObject</code> instances. If you create a custom Python
type (<code>PyTypeObject</code>) to represent your complex values, you
can define the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_members">tp_members</a>
and/or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_getset">tp_getset</a>
fields to register custom C functions to resolve the value for
an attribute. If you are say writing a parser and you know that
consumers will only access a subset of the parsed fields, you can
quickly construct a type holding the raw data, return that type,
and have the Python attribute lookup call a C function which
resolves the <code>PyObject</code>. You can even defer parsing until this
function is called, saving additional overhead if a parse is
never required! This technique is quite rare (because it requires
writing a non-trivial amount of code against the Python C API).
But it can result in substantial wins.</p>
<h2>Pre-Sizing Collections</h2>
<p>This one applies to the CPython C API.</p>
<p>When creating collections like lists or dicts, use e.g.
<code>PyList_New()</code> + <code>PyList_SET_ITEM()</code> to populate new
collections when their size is known at collection creation
time. This will pre-size the collection to have capacity to hold
the final number of elements. And it skips checks when inserting
elements that the collection is large enough to hold them. When
creating collections of thousands of elements, this can save a
bit of overhead!</p>
<h2>Using Zero-copy in the C API</h2>
<p>The CPython C API really likes to make copies of things rather
than return references. For example,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/bytes.html#c.PyBytes_FromStringAndSize">PyBytes_FromStringAndSize()</a>
copies a <code>char*</code> to memory <em>owned</em> by Python. If you are doing
this for a large number of values or sufficiently large data,
we could be talking about gigabytes of memory I/O and associated
allocator overhead.</p>
<p>If writing high-performance code against the C API, you'll want
to become familiar with the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/buffer.html">buffer protocol</a>
and related types, like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/memoryview.html">memoryview</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>buffer protocol</em> is implemented by Python types and allows
the Python interpreter to <em>cast</em> a type to/from bytes. It essentially
allows the interpreter's C code to get a handle on a
<code>void*</code> of certain size representing the object. This allows you
to associate any address in memory with a <code>PyObject</code>. Many
functions operating on binary data transparently accept any
object implementing the <em>buffer protocol</em>. And if you are coding
against the C API and want to accept any object that can be
treated as bytes, you should be using the
<code>s*</code>, <code>y*</code> or <code>w*</code>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#strings-and-buffers">format units</a>
when parsing function arguments.</p>
<p>By using the buffer protocol, you give the interpreter the
best opportunity possible to be using zero-copy operations and
avoiding having to copy bytes around in memory.</p>
<p>By using Python types like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a>,
you are also allowing Python to reference slices of memory by
reference instead of by copy.</p>
<p>When you have gigabytes of data flowing through your Python
program, astute use of Python types that support zero-copy can
make a world of difference on performance. I once measured
that <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">python-zstandard</a>
was faster than some Python LZ4 bindings (LZ4 should be faster
than zstandard) because I made heavy use of the buffer protocol
and avoiding excessive memory I/O in python-zstandard!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post has outlined some of the things I've learned optimizing
Python programs over the years. This post is by no means
a comprehensive overview of Python performance techniques and
gotchas. I recognize that my use of Python is probably more
demanding than most and that the recommendations I made are
not applicable to many Python programs. <strong>You should not
mass update your Python code to e.g. inline functions and
remove attribute lookups after reading this post.</strong> As always,
when it comes to performance optimization, measure first and
optimize where things are observed to be slow. I highly recommend
<a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy">py-spy</a> for profiling Python
applications. That being said, it's hard to attach a time value
to low-level activity in the Python interpreter such as calling
functions and looking up attributes. So if you e.g. have a loop 
that you know is tight, experiment with suggestions in this post,
and see if you can measure an improvement!</p>
<p>Finally this post should not be interpreted as a dig against Python
or its performance properties. Yes, you can make arguments that
Python should or shouldn't be used in particular areas because of
performance properties. But Python is extremely versatile -
especially with PyPy delivering exceptional performance for a
dynamic programming language. The performance of Python is probably
<em>good enough</em> for most people. For better or worse, I have used
Python for uses cases that often feel like outliers across all
users. And I wanted to share my experiences such that others
know what life at the frontier is like. And maybe, just maybe, I
can cause the smart people who actually maintain Python distributions
to think about the issues I've had in more detail and provide
improvements to mitigate them.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>After almost seven and a half years as an employee of Mozilla Corporation,
I'm moving on. I have already worked my final day as an employee.</p>
<p>This post is the first time that I've publicly acknowledged my departure.
To any Mozillians reading this, I regret that I did not send out a
farewell email before I left. But the circumstances of my departure weren't
conducive to doing so. I've been drafting a proper farewell blog post. But
it has been very challenging to compose. Furthermore, each passing day
brings with it new insights into my time at Mozilla and a new wrinkle to
integrate into the reflective story I want to tell in that post. I vow to
eventually publish a proper goodbye that serves as the bookend to my
employment at Mozilla. Until then, just let me say that I'm already missing
working with many of you. I've connected with several people since I left
and still owe responses or messages to many more. If you want to get in
touch, my contact info is in my <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>
<p>I left Mozilla without new employment lined up. That leads me to the
subject line of this post: I'm seeking employment. The remainder of this
post is thus tailored to potential employers.</p>
<p>My <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a> has been updated. But that two page summary
only scratches the surface of my experience and set of skills. The
<a href="/work.html">Body of Work</a> page of my website is a more detailed record
of the work I've done. But even it is not complete!</p>
<p>Perusing through my posts on this blog will reveal even more about the
work I've done and how I go about it. My résumé links to a few posts
that I think are great examples of the level of understanding and detail
that I'm capable of harnessing.</p>
<p>As far as the kind of work I want to do or the type of company I want
to work for, I'm trying to keep an open mind. But I do have some biases.</p>
<p>I prefer established companies to early start-ups for various reasons.
Dan Luu's <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">Big companies v. startups</a>
is aligned pretty well with my thinking.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I worked for Mozilla was because of my personal
alignment with the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. So
I gravitate towards employers that share those principles and am
somewhat turned off by those that counteract them. But I recognize that
the world is complex and that competing perspectives aren't intrinsically
evil. In other words, I try to maintain an open mind.</p>
<p>I'm attracted to employers that align their business with improving the
well-being of the planet, especially the people on it. The link
between the business and well-being can be tenuous: a B2B business for
example is presumably selling something that helps people, and that helping
is what matters to me. The tighter the link between the business and
improving the world will increase my attraction to a employer.</p>
<p>I started my university education as a biomedical engineer because I
liked the idea of being at the intersection of technology and medicine.
And part of me really wants to return to this space because there
are few things more noble than helping a fellow human being in need.</p>
<p>As for the kind of role or technical work I want to do, I could go in
any number of directions. I still enjoy doing individual contributor type
work and believe I could be an asset to an employer doing that work. But
I also crave working on a team, performing technical mentorship, and being
a leader of technical components. I enjoy participating in high-level
planning as well as implementing the low-level aspects. I recognize that
while my individual output can be substantial (I can provide data showing
that I was one of the most prolific technical contributors at Mozilla
during my time there) I can be more valuable to an employer when I
bestow skills and knowledge unto others through teaching, mentorship,
setting an example, etc.</p>
<p>I have what I would consider expertise in a few domains that may be
attractive to employers.</p>
<p>I was a technical maintainer of Firefox's build system and initiated a
transition away from an architecture that had been in place since the
Netscape days. I definitely geek out way too much on build systems.</p>
<p>I am a contributor to the Mercurial version control tool. I know way
too much about the internals of Mercurial, Git, and other version
control tools. I am intimately aware of scaling problems with these
tools. Some of the scaling work I did for Mercurial saved Mozilla tens
of thousands of dollars in direct operational costs and probably
hundreds of thousands of dollars in saved people time due to fewer
service disruptions and faster operations.</p>
<p>I have exposure to both client and server side work and the problems
encountered within each domain. I've dabbled in lots of technologies,
operating systems, and tools. I'm not afraid to learn something new.
Although as my experience increases, so does my skepticism of shiny
new things (I've been burned by technical fads too many times).</p>
<p>I have a keen fascination with optimization and scaling, whether it
be on a technical level or in terms of workflows and human behavior.
I like to ask <em>and then what</em> so I'm thinking a few steps out and am
prepared for the next problem or consequence of an immediate action.</p>
<p>I seem to have a knack for caring about user experience and interfaces.
(Although my own visual design skills aren't the greatest - see my
website design for proof.) I'm pretty passionate that tools that people
use should be simple and usable. Cognitive dissonance, latency, and
distractions are real and as an industry we don't do a great job
minimizing these disruptions so focus and productivity can be
maximized. I'm not saying I would be a good product manager or
UI designer. But it's something I've thought about because not many
engineers seem to exhibit the passion for good user experience that
I do and that intersection of skills could be valuable.</p>
<p>My favorite time at Mozilla was when I was working on a unified
<em>engineering productivity</em> team. The team controlled most of the tools
and infrastructure that Firefox developers interacted with in order
to do their jobs. I absolutely loved taking a whole-world view of
that problem space and identifying the high-level problems - and
low-hanging fruit - to improve the overall Firefox development
experience. I derived a lot of satisfaction from identifying pain
points, equating them to a dollar cost by extrapolating people time
wasted due to them, justifying working on them, and finally
celebrating - along with the overall engineering team - when improvements
were made. I think I would be a tremendous asset to a company working
in this space. And if my experience at Mozilla is any indicator, I
would more than offset my total employment cost by doing this kind
of work.</p>
<p>I've been entertaining the idea of contracting for a while before
I resume full-time employment with a single employer. However, I've
never contracted before and need to do some homework before I commit
to that. (Please leave a comment or email me if you have recommendations
on reading material.)</p>
<p>My dream contract gig would likely be to finish the Mercurial wire
protocol and storage work I started last year. I would need to type
up a formal proposal, but the gist of it is the work I started has the
potential to leapfrog Git in terms of both client-side and server-side
performance and scalability. Mercurial would be able to open Git
repositories on the local filesystem as well as consume them via the
Git wire protocol. Transparent Git interoperability would enable
Mercurial to be used as a drop-in replacement for Git, which would
benefit users who don't have control over the server (such as projects
that live on GitHub). Mercurial's new wire protocol is designed with
global scalability and distribution in mind. The goal is to enable
server operators to deploy scalable VCS servers in a turn-key manner
by relying on scalable key-value stores and content distribution
networks as much as possible (Mercurial and Git today require servers
to perform way too much work and aren't designed with modern distributed
systems best practices, which is why scaling them is hard). The new
protocol is being designed such that a <em>Mercurial</em> server could expose
Git data. It would then be possible to teach a Git client to speak the
<em>Mercurial</em> wire protocol, which would result in Mercurial being a more
scalable Git server than Git is today. If my vision is achieved, this
would make server-side VCS scaling problems go away and would eliminate
the religious debate between Git and Mercurial (the answer would be
<em>deploy a Mercurial server, allow data to be exposed to Git, and let
consumers choose</em>). I conservatively estimate that the benefits to
industry would be in the millions of dollars. How I would structure
a contract to deliver aspects of this, I'm not sure. But if you are
willing to invest six figures towards this bet, let's talk. A good
foundation of this work is already implemented in Mercurial and the
Mercurial core development team is already on-board with many aspects
of the vision, so I'm not spewing vapor.</p>
<p>Another potential contract opportunity would be funding
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/category/pyoxidizer/">PyOxidizer</a>.
I started the project a few months back as a side-project as an
excuse to learn Rust while solving a <em>fun</em> problem that I thought
needed solving. I was hoping for the project to be useful for
Mercurial and Mozilla one day. But if social media activity is any
indication, there seems to be somewhat widespread interest in this
project. I have no doubt that once complete, companies will be using
PyOxidizer to ship products that generate revenue and that PyOxidizer
will save them engineering resources. I'd very much like to recapture
some of that value into my pockets, if possible. Again, I'm somewhat
naive about how to write contracts since I've never contracted, but I
imagine <em>deliver a tool that allows me to ship product X as a
standalone binary to platforms Y and Z</em> is definitely something that
could be structured as a contract. </p>
<p>As for the timeline, I was at Mozilla for what feels like an eternity
in Silicon Valley. And Mozilla's way of working is substantially
different from many companies. I need some time to decompress and
unlearn some Mozilla habits. My future employer will inherit a happier
and more productive employee by allowing me to take some much-needed
time off.</p>
<p>I'm looking to resume full-time work no sooner than March 1. I'd like
to figure out what the next step in my career is by the end of January.
Then I can sign some papers, pack up my skiis, and become a ski bum
for the month of February: if I don't use this unemployment opportunity
to have at least 20 days on the slopes this season and visit some new
mountains, I will be very disappointed in myself!</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch, my contact info is in my
<a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>. I tend not to answer incoming calls from
unknown numbers, so email is preferred. But if you leave a voicemail,
I'll try to get back to you.</p>
<p>I look forward to working for a great engineering organization in the
near future!</p>
