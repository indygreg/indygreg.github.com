  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>After almost seven and a half years as an employee of Mozilla Corporation,
I'm moving on. I have already worked my final day as an employee.</p>
<p>This post is the first time that I've publicly acknowledged my departure.
To any Mozillians reading this, I regret that I did not send out a
farewell email before I left. But the circumstances of my departure weren't
conducive to doing so. I've been drafting a proper farewell blog post. But
it has been very challenging to compose. Furthermore, each passing day
brings with it new insights into my time at Mozilla and a new wrinkle to
integrate into the reflective story I want to tell in that post. I vow to
eventually publish a proper goodbye that serves as the bookend to my
employment at Mozilla. Until then, just let me say that I'm already missing
working with many of you. I've connected with several people since I left
and still owe responses or messages to many more. If you want to get in
touch, my contact info is in my <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>
<p>I left Mozilla without new employment lined up. That leads me to the
subject line of this post: I'm seeking employment. The remainder of this
post is thus tailored to potential employers.</p>
<p>My <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a> has been updated. But that two page summary
only scratches the surface of my experience and set of skills. The
<a href="/work.html">Body of Work</a> page of my website is a more detailed record
of the work I've done. But even it is not complete!</p>
<p>Perusing through my posts on this blog will reveal even more about the
work I've done and how I go about it. My résumé links to a few posts
that I think are great examples of the level of understanding and detail
that I'm capable of harnessing.</p>
<p>As far as the kind of work I want to do or the type of company I want
to work for, I'm trying to keep an open mind. But I do have some biases.</p>
<p>I prefer established companies to early start-ups for various reasons.
Dan Luu's <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">Big companies v. startups</a>
is aligned pretty well with my thinking.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I worked for Mozilla was because of my personal
alignment with the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. So
I gravitate towards employers that share those principles and am
somewhat turned off by those that counteract them. But I recognize that
the world is complex and that competing perspectives aren't intrinsically
evil. In other words, I try to maintain an open mind.</p>
<p>I'm attracted to employers that align their business with improving the
well-being of the planet, especially the people on it. The link
between the business and well-being can be tenuous: a B2B business for
example is presumably selling something that helps people, and that helping
is what matters to me. The tighter the link between the business and
improving the world will increase my attraction to a employer.</p>
<p>I started my university education as a biomedical engineer because I
liked the idea of being at the intersection of technology and medicine.
And part of me really wants to return to this space because there
are few things more noble than helping a fellow human being in need.</p>
<p>As for the kind of role or technical work I want to do, I could go in
any number of directions. I still enjoy doing individual contributor type
work and believe I could be an asset to an employer doing that work. But
I also crave working on a team, performing technical mentorship, and being
a leader of technical components. I enjoy participating in high-level
planning as well as implementing the low-level aspects. I recognize that
while my individual output can be substantial (I can provide data showing
that I was one of the most prolific technical contributors at Mozilla
during my time there) I can be more valuable to an employer when I
bestow skills and knowledge unto others through teaching, mentorship,
setting an example, etc.</p>
<p>I have what I would consider expertise in a few domains that may be
attractive to employers.</p>
<p>I was a technical maintainer of Firefox's build system and initiated a
transition away from an architecture that had been in place since the
Netscape days. I definitely geek out way too much on build systems.</p>
<p>I am a contributor to the Mercurial version control tool. I know way
too much about the internals of Mercurial, Git, and other version
control tools. I am intimately aware of scaling problems with these
tools. Some of the scaling work I did for Mercurial saved Mozilla tens
of thousands of dollars in direct operational costs and probably
hundreds of thousands of dollars in saved people time due to fewer
service disruptions and faster operations.</p>
<p>I have exposure to both client and server side work and the problems
encountered within each domain. I've dabbled in lots of technologies,
operating systems, and tools. I'm not afraid to learn something new.
Although as my experience increases, so does my skepticism of shiny
new things (I've been burned by technical fads too many times).</p>
<p>I have a keen fascination with optimization and scaling, whether it
be on a technical level or in terms of workflows and human behavior.
I like to ask <em>and then what</em> so I'm thinking a few steps out and am
prepared for the next problem or consequence of an immediate action.</p>
<p>I seem to have a knack for caring about user experience and interfaces.
(Although my own visual design skills aren't the greatest - see my
website design for proof.) I'm pretty passionate that tools that people
use should be simple and usable. Cognitive dissonance, latency, and
distractions are real and as an industry we don't do a great job
minimizing these disruptions so focus and productivity can be
maximized. I'm not saying I would be a good product manager or
UI designer. But it's something I've though about because not many
engineers seem to exhibit the passion for good user experience that
I do and that intersection of skills could be valuable.</p>
<p>My favorite time at Mozilla was when I was working on a unified
<em>engineering productivity</em> team. The team controlled most of the tools
and infrastructure that Firefox developers interacted with in order
to do their jobs. I absolutely loved taking a whole-world view of
that problem space and identifying the high-level problems - and
low-hanging fruit - to improve the overall Firefox development
experience. I derived a lot of satisfaction from identifying pain
points, equating them to a dollar cost by extrapolating people time
wasted due to them, justifying working on them, and finally
celebrating - along with the overall engineering team - when improvements
were made. I think I would be a tremendous asset to a company working
in this space. And if my experience at Mozilla is any indicator, I
would more than offset my total employment cost by doing this kind
of work.</p>
<p>I've been entertaining the idea of contracting for a while before
I resume full-time employment with a single employer. However, I've
never contracted before and need to do some homework before I commit
to that. (Please leave a comment or email me if you have recommendations
on reading material.)</p>
<p>My dream contract gig would likely be to finish the Mercurial wire
protocol and storage work I started last year. I would need to type
up a formal proposal, but the gist of it is the work I started has the
potential to leapfrog Git in terms of both client-side and server-side
performance and scalability. Mercurial would be able to open Git
repositories on the local filesystem as well as consume them via the
Git wire protocol. Transparent Git interoperability would enable
Mercurial to be used as a drop-in replacement for Git, which would
benefit users who don't have control over the server (such as projects
that live on GitHub). Mercurial's new wire protocol is designed with
global scalability and distribution in mind. The goal is to enable
server operators to deploy scalable VCS servers in a turn-key manner
by relying on scalable key-value stores and content distribution
networks as much as possible (Mercurial and Git today require servers
to perform way too much work and aren't designed with modern distributed
systems best practices, which is why scaling them is hard). The new
protocol is being designed such that a <em>Mercurial</em> server could expose
Git data. It would then be possible to teach a Git client to speak the
<em>Mercurial</em> wire protocol, which would result in Mercurial being a more
scalable Git server than Git is today. If my vision is achieved, this
would make server-side VCS scaling problems go away and would eliminate
the religious debate between Git and Mercurial (the answer would be
<em>deploy a Mercurial server, allow data to be exposed to Git, and let
consumers choose</em>). I conservatively estimate that the benefits to
industry would be in the millions of dollars. How I would structure
a contract to deliver aspects of this, I'm not sure. But if you are
willing to invest six figures towards this bet, let's talk. A good
foundation of this work is already implemented in Mercurial and the
Mercurial core development team is already on-board with many aspects
of the vision, so I'm not spewing vapor.</p>
<p>Another potential contract opportunity would be funding
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/category/pyoxidizer/">PyOxidizer</a>.
I started the project a few months back as a side-project as an
excuse to learn Rust while solving a <em>fun</em> problem that I thought
needed solving. I was hoping for the project to be useful for
Mercurial and Mozilla one day. But if social media activity is any
indication, there seems to be somewhat widespread interest in this
project. I have no doubt that once complete, companies will be using
PyOxidizer to ship products that generate revenue and that PyOxidizer
will save them engineering resources. I'd very much like to recapture
some of that value into my pockets, if possible. Again, I'm somewhat
naive about how to write contracts since I've never contracted, but I
imagine <em>deliver a tool that allows me to ship product X as a
standalone binary to platforms Y and Z</em> is definitely something that
could be structured as a contract. </p>
<p>As for the timeline, I was at Mozilla for what feels like an eternity
in Silicon Valley. And Mozilla's way of working is substantially
different from many companies. I need some time to decompress and
unlearn some Mozilla habits. My future employer will inherit a happier
and more productive employee by allowing me to take some much-needed
time off.</p>
<p>I'm looking to resume full-time work no sooner than March 1. I'd like
to figure out what the next step in my career is by the end of January.
Then I can sign some papers, pack up my skies, and become a ski bum
for the month of February: if I don't use this unemployment opportunity
to have at least 20 days on the slopes this season and visit some new
mountains, I will be very disappointed in myself!</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch, my contact info is in my
<a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>. I tend not to answer incoming calls from
unknown numbers, so email is preferred. But if you leave a voicemail,
I'll try to get back to you.</p>
<p>I look forward to working for a great engineering organization in the
near future!</p>
