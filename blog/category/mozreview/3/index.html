  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mozilla is very close to rolling out a new
<a href="http://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview.html">code review tool based on Review Board</a>.
When I became involved in the project, I viewed it as an opportunity to
start from a clean slate and design the ideal code development workflow
for the average Firefox developer. When the design of the code review
experience was discussed, I would push for decisions that were
compatible with my utopian end state.</p>
<p>As part of formulating the ideal workflows and design of the new tool,
I needed to investigate why we do things the way we do, whether they are
optimal, and whether they are necessary. As part of that, I spent a lot
of time thinking about Bugzilla's role in shaping the code that goes into
Firefox. This post is a summary of my findings.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this post is to dissect the practices that Bugzilla
influences and to prepare the reader for the potential to reassemble the
pieces - to change the workflows - in the future, primarily around
Mozilla's new code review tool. By showing that Bugzilla has influenced
the popularization of what I consider non-optimal practices, it is my
hope that readers start to question the existing processes and open up
their mind to change.</p>
<p>Since the impetus for this post in the near deployment of Mozilla's new
code review tool, many of my points will focus on code review.</p>
<p>Before I go into my findings, I'd like to explicitly state that while
many of the things I'm about to say may come across as negativity
towards Bugzilla, my intentions are not to put down Bugzilla or the
people who maintain it. Yes, there are limitations in Bugzilla. But I
don't think it is correct to point fingers and blame Bugzilla or its
maintainers for these limitations. I think we got where we are following
years of very gradual shifts. I don't think you can blame Bugzilla for
the circumstances that led us here. Furthermore, Bugzilla maintainers
are quick to admit the faults and limitations of Bugzilla. And, they are
adamant about and instrumental in rolling out the new code review tool,
which shifts code review <em>out</em> of Bugzilla. Again, my intent is not to
put down Bugzilla. So please don't direct ire that way yourself.</p>
<p>So, let's drill down into some of the implications of using Bugzilla.</p>
<h2>Difficult to Separate Contexts</h2>
<p>The stream of changes on a bug in Bugzilla (including review comments)
is a flat, linear list of plain text comments. This works great when the
activity of a bug follows a nice, linear, singular topic flow. However,
real bug activity does not happen this way. All but the most trivial bugs
usually involve multiple points of discussion. You typically have
discussion about what the bug is. When a patch comes along, reviewer
feedback comes in both high-level and low-level forms. Each
item in each group is its own logical discussion thread. When patches
land, you typically have points of discussion tracking the state of this
patch. Has it been tested, does it need uplift, etc.</p>
<p>Bugzilla has things like keywords, flags, comment tags, and the
whiteboard to enable some isolation of these various contexts. However,
you still have a flat, linear list of plain text comments that contain
the meat of the activity. It can be extremely difficult to follow these
many interleaved logical threads.</p>
<p>In the context of code review, lumping all review comments into the same
linear list adds overhead and undermines the process of landing the
highest-quality patch possible.</p>
<p>Review feedback consists of both high-level and low-level comments.
High-level would be things like architecture discussions. Low-level
would be comments on the code itself. When these two classes of comments
are lumped together in the same text field, I believe it is easy to
lose track of the high-level comments and focus on the low-level. After
all, you may have a short paragraph of high-level feedback right next to
a mountain of low-level comments. Your eyes and brain tend to gravitate
towards the larger set of more concrete low-level comments because you
sub-consciously want to fix your problems and that large mass of text
represents more problems, easier problems to solve than the shorter and
often more abstract high-level summary. You want instant gratification
and the pile of low-level comments is just too tempting to pass up. We
have to train ourselves to temporarily ignore the low-level comments and
focus on the high-level feedback. This is very difficult for some people.
It is not an ideal disposition.
<a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2014-10-22/how-i-do-code-reviews-at-mozilla/">Benjamin Smedberg's recent post on code
review</a>
indirectly talks about some of this by describing his rational
approach of tackling high-level first.</p>
<p>As review iterations occur, the bug devolves into a mix of comments
related to high and low-level comments. It thus becomes harder and
harder to track the current high-level state of the feedback, as they
must be picked out from the mountain of low-level comments. If you've
ever inherited someone else's half-finished bug, you know what I'm
talking about.</p>
<p>I believe that Bugzilla's threadless and contextless comment flow
disposes us towards focusing on low-level details instead of the
high-level. I believe that important high-level discussions aren't
occurring at the rate they need and that technical debt increases as a
result.</p>
<h2>Difficulty Tracking Individual Items of Feedback</h2>
<p>Code review feedback consists of multiple items of feedback. Each one is
related to the review at hand. But oftentimes each item can be
considered independent from others, relevant only to a single line or
section of code. Style feedback is one such example.</p>
<p>I find it helps to model code review as a tree. You start with one thing
you want to do. That's the root node. You split that thing into multiple
commits.  That's a new layer on your tree. Finally, each comment on those
commits and the comments on those comments represent new layers to the tree.
Code review thus consists of many related, but independent branches, all
flowing back to the same central concept or goal. There is a one to many
relationship at nearly every level of the tree.</p>
<p>Again, Bugzilla lumps all these individual items of feedback into a
linear series of flat text blobs. When you are commenting on code, you
do get some code context printed out. But everything is plain text.</p>
<p>The result of this is that tracking the progress on individual items of
feedback - individual branches in our conceptual tree - is difficult. Code
authors must pore through text comments and manually keep an inventory
of their progress towards addressing the comments. Some people copy the
review comment into another text box or text editor and delete items once
they've fixed them locally! And, when it comes time to review the new
patch version, reviewers must go through the same exercise in order to
verify that all their original points of feedback have been adequately
addressed! You've now redundantly duplicated the feedback tracking
mechanism among at least two people. That's wasteful in of itself.</p>
<p>Another consequence of this unstructured feedback tracking mechanism is
that points of feedback tend to get lost. On complex reviews, you may be
sorting through dozens of individual points of feedback. It is extremely
easy to lose track of something. This could have disastrous
consequences, such as the accidental creation of a 0day bug in Firefox.
OK, that's a worst case scenario. But I know from experience that review
comments can and do get lost. This results in new bugs being filed,
author and reviewer double checking to see if other comments were not
acted upon, and possibly severe bugs with user impacting behavior. In
other words, this unstructured tracking of review feedback tends to lessen
code quality and is thus a contributor to technical debt.</p>
<h2>Fewer, Larger Patches</h2>
<p>Bugzilla's user interface encourages the writing of fewer, larger
patches. (The opposite would be many, smaller patches - sometimes
referred to as <em>micro commits</em>.)</p>
<p>This result is achieved by a user interface that handles multiple
patches so poorly that it effectively discourages that approach, driving
people to create larger patches.</p>
<p>The stream of changes on a bug (including review comments) is
a flat, linear list of plain text comments. This works great when
the activity of a bug follows a nice, linear flow. However, reviewing
multiple patches doesn't work in a linear model. If you attach multiple
patches to a bug, the review comments and their replies for all the
patches will be interleaved in the same linear comment list. This
flies in the face of the reality that each patch/review is logically
its own thread that deserves to be followed on its own. The end result
is that it is extremely difficult to track what's going on in each
patch's review. Again, we have different contexts - different branches
of a tree - all living in the same flat list.</p>
<p>Because conducting review on separate patches is so painful, people are
effectively left with two choices: 1) write a single, monolithic patch
2) create a new bug. Both options suck.</p>
<p>Larger, monolithic patches are harder and slower to review. Larger
patches require much more cognitive load to review, as the reviewer
needs to capture the entire context in order to make a review
determination. This takes more time. The increased surface area of the
patch also increases the liklihood that the reviewer will find something
wrong and will require a re-review. The added complexity of a larger
patch also means the chances of a bug creeping in are higher, leading
to more bugs being filed and more reviews later. The more review cycles
the patch goes through, the greater the chances it will suffer from bit
rot and will need updating before it lands, possibly incurring yet more
rounds of review. And, since we measure progress in terms of code
landing, the delay to get a large patch through many rounds of review
makes us feel lethargic and demotivates us. <strong>Large patches have
intrinsic properties that lead to compounding problems and increased
development cost.</strong></p>
<p>As bad as large patches are, they are roughly in the same badness range
as the alternative: creating more bugs.</p>
<p>When you create a new bug to hold the context for the review of an
individual commit, you are doing a lot of things, very few of them
helpful. First, you must create a new bug. There's overhead to do
that. You need to type in a summary, set up the bug dependencies,
CC the proper people, update the commit message in your patch, upload
your patch/attachment to the new bug, mark the attachment on the old
bug obsolete, etc. This is arguably tolerable, especially with tools
that can automate the steps (although I don't believe there is a
single tool that does all of what I mentioned automatically). But the
badness of multiple bugs doesn't stop there.</p>
<p><strong>Creating multiple bugs fragments the knowledge and history of your
change and diminishes the purpose of a bug.</strong> You got in the situation
of creating multiple bugs because you were working on a <em>single logical
change</em>. It just so happened that you needed/wanted multiple
commits/patches/reviews to represent that singular change. That initial
change was likely tracked by a single bug. And now, because of
Bugzilla's poor user interface around mutliple patch reviews, you now
find yourself creating yet another bug. Now you have two bug
numbers - two identifiers that look identical, only
varying by their numeric value - referring to the same logical thing.
We've started with a single bug number referring to your logical
change and created what are effectively sub-issues, but allocated them
in the same namespace as <em>normal bugs</em>. We've diminished the importance
of the average bug. We've introduced confusion as to where one should go
to learn about this single, logical change. <em>Should I go to bug X or bug
Y?</em> Sure, you can likely go to one and ultimately find what you were
looking for. But that takes more effort.</p>
<p><strong>Creating separate bugs for separate reviews also makes refactoring
harder.</strong> If you are going the micro commit route, chances are you do
a lot of history rewriting. Commits are combined. Commits are split.
Commits are reordered. And if those commits are all mapping to
individual bugs, you potentially find yourself in a huge mess. Combining
commits might mean resolving bugs as duplicates of each other. Splitting
commits means creating yet another bug. And let's not forget about
managing bug dependencies. Do you set up your dependencies so you have a
linear, waterfall dependency corresponding to commit order? That
logically makes sense, but it is hard to keep in sync. Or, do you
just make all the <em>review bugs</em> depend on a single parent bug? If you do
that, how do you communicate the order of the patches to the reviewer?
Manually? That's yet more overhead. History rewriting - an operation
that modern version control tools like Git and Mercurial have enabled
to be a lightweight operation and users love because it doesn't
constrain them to pre-defined workflows - thus become much more costly.
The cost may even be so high that some people forego rewriting completely,
trading their effort for some poor reviewer who has to inherit a series of
patches that isn't organized as logically as it could be. Like larger
patches, this increases cognitive load required to perform reviews
and increases development costs.</p>
<p>As you can see, reviewing multiple, smaller patches with Bugzilla often
leads to a horrible user experience. So, we find ourselves writing
larger, monolithic patches and living with their numerous
deficiencies. At least with monolithic patches we have a predictable
outcome for how interaction with Bugzilla will play out!</p>
<p><strong>I have little doubt that large patches (whose existence is influenced
by the UI of Bugzilla) slows down the development velocity of Firefox.</strong></p>
<h2>Commit Message Formatting</h2>
<p>The heavy involvement of Bugzilla in our code development
lifecycle has influenced how we write commit messages. Let's start with
the obvious example. Here is our standard commit message format for
Firefox:</p>
<p>Bug 1234 - Fix some feature foo; r=gps</p>
<p>The bug is right there at the front of the commit message. That
prominent placement is effectively saying <strong>the bug number is the most
important detail about this commit - everything else is ancillary</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure some of you are saying, <em>but Greg, the short description
of the change is obviously more important than the bug number</em>. You are
right. But we've allowed ourselves to make the bug and the content
therein more important than the commit.</p>
<p>Supporting my theory is the commit message content following the
first/summary line. That data is almost always - wait for it -
<strong>nothing: we generally don't write commit messages that contain more
than a single summary line</strong>. My repository forensics show that that
less than 20% of commit messages to Firefox in 2014 contain multiple
lines (this excludes merge and backout commits). (We are doing better
than 2013 - the rate was less than 15% then).</p>
<p>Our commit messages are basically saying, <em>here's a highly-abbreviated
summary of the change and a pointer (a bug number) to where you can
find out more</em>. And of course loading the bug typically reveals a mass of
interleaved comments on various topics, hardly the high-level summary
you were hoping was captured in the commit message.</p>
<p>Before I go on, in case you are on the fence as to the benefit of
detailed commit messages, please read Phabricator's recommendations on
<a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/recommendations_on_revision_control/">revision control</a>
and <a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/writing_reviewable_code/">writing reviewable code</a>.
I think both write-ups are terrific and are excellent templates that
apply to nearly everyone, especially a project as large and complex as
Firefox.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are many reasons why we don't capture a detailed, multi-line
commit message. For starters, you aren't immediately rewarded for doing
it: writing a good commit message doesn't really improve much in the short
term (unless someone <em>yells</em> at you for not doing it). This is a generic
problem applicable to all organizations and tools. This is a problem that
culture must ultimately rectify. But our tools shouldn't reinforce the
disposition towards laziness: they should reward best practices.</p>
<p>I don't believe Bugzilla and our interactions with it do an adequate job
rewarding good commit message writing. Chances are your mechanism for posting
reviews to Bugzilla or posting the publishing of a commit to Bugzilla
(pasting the URL in the simple case) brings up a text box for you to type
<em>review notes</em>, a patch description, or extra context for the landing. These
<em>should</em> be going in the commit message, as they are the type of high-level
context and summarizations of choices or actions that people crave when
discerning the history of a repository. But because that text box is there,
taunting you with its presence, we write content there instead of in the
commit message. Even where tools like bzexport exist to upload patches
to Bugzilla, potentially nipping this practice in the bug, it still engages
in frustrating behavior like reposting the same long commit message on
every patch upload, producing unwanted bug spam. Even a tool that is
pretty sensibly designed has an implementation detail that undermines a
good practice.</p>
<h2>Machine Processing of Patches is Difficult</h2>
<p>I have a challenge for you: identify all patches currently under
consideration for incorporation in the Firefox source tree, run static
analysis on them, and tell me if they meet our code style policies.</p>
<p>This should be a solved problem and deployed system at Mozilla. It
isn't. Part of the problem is because we're using Bugzilla for
conducting review and doing patch management. That may sound
counter-intuitive at first: Bugzilla is a centralized service - surely we
can poll it to discover patches and then do stuff with those patches.
We can. In theory. Things break down very quickly if you try this.</p>
<p>We are uploading patch files to Bugzilla. Patch files are
representations of commits that live outside a repository. In order to
get the full context - the result of the patch file - you need all the
content leading up to that patch file - the repository data. When a
naked patch file is uploaded to Bugzilla, you don't always have this
context.</p>
<p>For starters, you don't know with certainly which repository
the patch belongs to because that isn't part of the standard patch
format produced by Mercurial or Git. There are patches for various
repositories floating around in Bugzilla. So now you need a way to
identify which repository a patch belongs to. It is a solvable problem
(aggregate data for all repositories and match patches based on file
paths, referenced commits, etc), albeit one Mozilla has not yet solved
(but should).</p>
<p>Assuming you can identify the repository a patch belongs to, you need to
know the parent commit so you can apply this patch. Some patches list
their parent commits. Others do not. Even those that do may lie about
it. Patches in MQ don't update their parent field when they are <em>pushed</em>,
only after they are <em>refreshed</em>. You could be testing and uploading a
patch with a different parent commit than what's listed in the patch
file! Even if you do identify the parent commit, this commit could
belong to another patch under consideration that's also on Bugzilla! So
now you need to assemble a directed graph with all the patches known
from Bugzilla applied. Hopefully they all fit in nicely.</p>
<p>Of course, some patches don't have any metadata at all: they are just
naked diffs or are malformed commits produced by tools that e.g. attempt
to convert Git commits to Mercurial commits (Git users: you should be
using hg-git to produce proper Mercurial commits for Firefox patches).</p>
<p>Because Bugzilla is talking in terms of patch files, we often lose
much of the context needed to build nice tools, preventing numerous
potential workflow optimizations through automation. There are many
things machines could be doing for us (such as looking for coding style
violations). Instead, humans are doing this work and costing Mozilla a
lot of time and lost developer productivity in the process. (A human
costs ~$100/hr. A machine on EC2 is pennies per hour and should do the
job with lower latency. In other words, you can operate over 300
machines 24 hours a day for what you may an engineer to work an 8 hour
shift.)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have outlined a few of the side-effects of using Bugzilla as part of
our day-to-day development, review, and landing of changes to Firefox.</p>
<p>There are several takeways.</p>
<p>First, one cannot argue the fact that Firefox development is bug(zilla)
centric. Nearly every important milestone in the lifecycle of a patch
involves Bugzilla in some way. This has its benefits and drawbacks. This
article has identified many of the drawbacks. But before you start
crying to expunge Bugzilla from the loop completely, consider the
benefits, such as a place anyone can go to to add metadata or comments
on something. That's huge. There is a larger discussion to be had here.
But I don't want to be inviting it quite yet.</p>
<p>A common thread between many of the points above is Bugzilla's
unstructured and generic handling of code and metadata attached to it
(patches, review comments, and landing information). Patches are
attachments, which can be anything under the sun. Review comments are
plain text comments with simple author, date, and tag metadata. Landings
are also communicated by plain text review comments (at least
initially - keywords and flags are used in some scenarios).</p>
<p>By being a generic tool, Bugzilla throws away a lot of the rich metadata
that we produce. That data is still technically there in many scenarios.
But it becomes extremely difficult if not practically impossible for
both humans and machines to access efficiently. We lose important
context and feedback by <em>normalizing all this data to Bugzilla</em>. This
data loss creates overhead and technical debt. It slows Mozilla down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the solutions to these problems and shortcomings are
conceptually simple (and generally applicable): preserve rich context. In
the context of patch distribution, push commits to a repository and tell
someone to pull those commits. In the context of code review, create
sub-reviews for different commits and allow tracking and easy-to-follow
(likely threaded) discussions on found issues. Design workflow to be code
first, not tool or bug first. Optimize workflows to minimize people time.
Lean heavily on machines to do grunt work. Integrate issue tracking and
code review, but not too tightly (loosely coupled, highly cohesive). Let
different tools specialize in the handling of different forms of data:
let code review handle code review. Let Bugzilla handle issue tracking.
Let a landing tool handle tracking the state of landings. Use middleware
to make them appear as one logical service if they aren't designed to be
one from the start (such as is Mozilla's case with Bugzilla).</p>
<p>Another solution that's generally applicable is to refine and optimize
the whole process to land a finished commit. Your product is based on
software. So anything that adds overhead or loss of quality in the
process of developing that software is fundamentally a product problem
and should be treated as such. Any time and brain cycles lost to
development friction or bugs that arise from things like inadequate
code reviews tools degrade the quality of your product and take away
from the user experience. This should be plain to see. Attaching a
cost to this to convince the business-minded folks that it is worth
addressing is a harder matter. I find management with empathy and shared
understanding of what amazing tools can do helps a lot.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the solution in one sentence, it would be: <em>invest in
tools and developer happiness.</em></p>
<p>I hope to soon publish a post on how Mozilla's new code review tool
addresses many of the workflow deficiencies present today. Stay tuned.</p>
