  <p>As of today, ~15.6% of commits landing in Firefox in July have gone
through <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> or have been produced
on machines that have used MozReview. This is still a small percentage
of overall commits. But, signs are that the percentage is going up. Last
month, about half as many commits exhibited the same signature. It's
only July 16 and we've already passed the total from June.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the differences between commits that have
gone through MozReview versus the rest. When you look at the diff
statistics (a quick proxy of change size), we find that MozReview
commits tend to be smaller. The median <em>adds</em> as reported by diff stat
(basically lines that were changed) is 12 for MozReview versus 17
elsewhere. The average is 58 for MozReview versus 100 elsewhere. For
number of files modified, MozReview averages 2.59 versus elsewhere's
2.71. (These numbers exclude some specific large commits that appeared to
be bulk imports of external projects and drove up the non-MozReview
figures.)</p>
<p>It's entirely possible the root cause behind the discrepancy is a
side-effect of the population of MozReview users: perhaps MozReview
users just write smaller commits. However, I'd like to think it's because
MozReview makes it easier to manage multiple commits and people are taking
advantage of that (this is an explicit design goal of MozReview). Whatever
the root cause, I'm glad diffs are smaller.
As I've <a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written about before</a>,
smaller commits are easier to review and land, thus enabling projects to
move faster.</p>
<p>I have a quarterly goal to remove the requirement for a Mozilla LDAP
account to push to MozReview. That will allow first time contributors to
use MozReview. This will be a huge win, as we can do much more magic in
the MozReview world than we can from vanilla Bugzilla (automatic bug
filing, automatic reviewer assignment, etc). Unofficially, I'd like to
have more than 50% of Firefox commits go through MozReview by the end of
the year.</p>

  <p>A lot of people contributed some really great feedback about MozReview
at Whistler. One of the most frequent requests was for the ability to
publish submitted review requests without having to open a browser.
I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday, this feature is implemented!
If reviewers have been assigned to all your review requests, Mercurial
will now prompt you to publish the review requests during <em>hg push</em>.
It should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we also introduced more advanced feature
negotiation into the handshake between client and server. This means
we now have a mechanism for detecting out-of-date client installations.
This will enable us to more aggressively drop backwards compatibility
(making server-side development easier) while simultaneously ensuring
that more people are running modern and hopefully better versions of the
client code. This should translate to moving faster and a better
experience for everyone.</p>

  <p>This was a busy week for MozReview! There are a number of changes people
need to be aware of.</p>
<h2>Support for Specifying Reviewers via Commit Messages</h2>
<p>MozReview will now parse <strong>r?gps</strong> syntax out of commit messages to
set reviewers for pushed commits.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/review-requests.html#specifying-reviewers-in-commit-messages">Read the docs</a>
for more information, including why we are preferring <strong>r?</strong> to <strong>r=</strong>.</p>
<p>Since it landed, a number of workflow concerns have been reported.
See the bug tree for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1142251">bug 1142251</a>
before filing a bug to help avoid duplicates.</p>
<p>Thank Dan Minor for the feature!</p>
<h2>Review Attachment/Flag Per Commit</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of MozReview, there was one Bugzilla attachment /
review flag per commit series. This has changed to one attachment /
review flag per commit.</p>
<p>Before, you needed to grant <em>Ship It</em> on the parent/root review request
in order to r+ the MozReview review request. Now, you grant <em>Ship It</em>
on individual commits and these turn into individual r+ on Bugzilla.
To reinforce that reviewing the parent/root review request doesn't do
anything meaningful any more, the <em>Ship It</em> button and checkbox have been
removed from the parent/root review request.</p>
<p>The new model more closely maps to how code review in Bugzilla has
worked at Mozilla for ages. And, it is a superior workflow for
future workflows we're trying to enable.</p>
<p>We tried to run a one-time migration script to convert existing
parent/root attachments/review flags to per-commit attachments/flags.
However, there were issues. We will attempt again sometime next week.
In the interim, <strong>in-flight review requests may enter an inconsistent
state if they are updated</strong>. If a new push is performed, the old
parent/root attachment/review flag may linger and per-commit
attachments/flags will be created. This could be confusing. The
workaround is to manually clear the r? flag from the parent/root
attachment or wait for the migration script to run in a few days.</p>
<p>Mark Côté put in a lot of hard work to make this change happen.</p>
<h2>r? Flags Cleared After Review</h2>
<p>Before, submitting a review without granting <em>Ship It</em> wouldn't do
anything to the r? flag: the r? flag would linger.</p>
<p>Now, submitting review without granting <em>Ship It</em> will clear the r?
flag. We think the new default is better for the majority of users.
However, we recognize it isn't always wanted. There is a bug open to
provide a checkbox to keep the r? flag present.</p>
<h2>Metadata Added to Changesets</h2>
<p>If you update to the tip of the version-control-tools repository
(you should do this every week or so to stay fresh - use <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em> to do this automatically), metadata will automatically
be added to commits when working with MozReview-enabled repositories.</p>
<p>Specifically, we insert a hidden, unique, random ID into every changeset.
This ID can be used to map commits to each other. We don't use this ID
yet. But we have plans.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this change is that you can no longer push to MozReview
if you have uncommitted local changes. If this is annoying, use <em>hg
shelve</em> and <em>hg unshelve</em> to create and undo temporary commits. If this
is too annoying, complain by filing a bug and we can look into doing
this automatically as part of pushing.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>We're actively working on more workflow enhancements to make MozReview
an even more compelling experience.</p>
<p>I'm building a web service to query file metadata from moz.build files.
This will allow MozReview to automatically file bugs in proper
components based on what files changed. Once code reviewer metadata
is added to moz.build files, it will enable us to assign reviewers
automatically as well. The end goal here is to lower the number of steps
needed to turn changed code into a landing. This will be useful when we
turn GitHub pull requests into MozReview review requests (random GitHub
contributors shouldn't need to know who to flag for review, nor should
they be required to file a bug if they write some code). Oh year, we're
working on integrating GitHub pull requests.</p>
<p>Another area of focus is better commit tracking and partially landed
series. I have preliminary patches for automatically adding review URL
annotations to commit messages. This will enable people to easily go
from commit (message) to MozReview, without having to jump through
Bugzilla. This also enables better commit tracking. If you e.g.
perform complicated history rewriting, the review URL annotation will
enable the MozReview server to better map previously-submitted commits
to existing review requests. Partially landed series will enable
commits to land as soon as they are reviewed, without having to wait
on the entire series. It's my strong belief that if a commit is granted
review, it should land as soon as possible. This helps prevent bit rot
of ready-to-land commits. Landings also make people feel better because
you feel like you've accomplished something. Positive feedback loops are
good.</p>
<p>Major work is also being done to overhaul the web UI. The commit series
view (which is currently populated via XHR) will soon be generated on
the server and served as part of the page. This should make pages load a
bit faster. And, things should be prettier as well.</p>
<p>And, of course, work is being invested into Autoland. Support for
submitting pushes to Try landed a few weeks ago. Having Autoland
actually land reviewed commits is on the radar.</p>
<p>Exciting times are ahead. Please continue to provide feedback. If you
see something, <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hacking-mozreview.html#filing-bugs">say something</a>.</p>

  <p>It is common for commit messages in Firefox to contains strings like
<em>Part 1</em>, <em>Part 2</em>, etc. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/build-system/pushloghtml?changeset=5cb8bcab09cc">this push</a>
for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841">bug 784841</a>
for an extreme multi-part example.</p>
<p>When code review is conducted in Bugzilla, these identifiers are
necessary because Bugzilla orders attachments/patches in the order they
were updated or their patch title (I'm not actually sure!). If part
numbers were omitted, it could be very confusing trying to figure out
which order patches should be applied in.</p>
<p>However, when code review is conducted in
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview.html">MozReview</a>,
<strong>there is no need for explicit part numbers to convey ordering</strong> because
the ordering of commits is implicitly defined by the repository history
that you pushed to MozReview!</p>
<p>I argue that if you are using MozReview, you should stop writing <em>Part
N</em> in your commit messages, as it provides little to no benefit.</p>
<p>I, for one, welcome this new world order: I've previously wasted a lot
of time rewriting commit messages to reflect new part ordering after
doing history rewriting. With MozReview, that overhead is gone and I
barely pay a penalty for rewriting history, something that often
produces a more reviewable series of commits and makes reviewing
and landing a complex patch series significantly easier.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A bunch of us were in Toronto last week hacking on MozReview.</p>
<p>One of the cool things we did was deploy a bot for performing Python
static analysis. If you submit some .py files to MozReview, the bot
should leave a review. If it finds violations (it uses
<a href="https://flake8.readthedocs.org/">flake8</a> internally), it will open
an issue for each violation. It also leaves a comment that should
hopefully give enough detail on how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While we haven't done much in the way of performance optimizations,
the bot typically submits results less than 10 seconds after the review
is posted! So, a human should never be reviewing Python that the bot
hasn't seen. This means you can stop thinking about style nits and start
thinking about what the code does.</p>
<p>This bot should be considered an alpha feature. The code for the bot
isn't even checked in yet. We're running the bot against production
to get a feel for how it behaves. If things don't go well, we'll turn
it off until the problems are fixed.</p>
<p>We'd like to eventually deploy C++, JavaScript, etc bots. Python won out
because it was the easiest to integrate (it has sane and efficient
tooling that is compatible with Mozilla's code bases - most existing
JavaScript tools won't work with Gecko-flavored JavaScript, sadly).</p>
<p>I'd also like to eventually make it easier to locally run the same
static analysis we run in MozReview. Addressing problems locally before
pushing is a no-brainer since it avoids needless context switching from
other people and is thus better for productivity. This will come in
time.</p>
<p>Report issues in #mozreview or in the Developer Services :: MozReview
Bugzilla component.</p>
