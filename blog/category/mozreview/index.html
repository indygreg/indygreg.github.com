  <p>MozReview - Mozilla's Review Board based code review tool - now
supports ingestion from Git. Previously, it only supported Mercurial.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install-git.html">Instructions</a>
for configuring Git with MozReview are available. Because blog posts
are not an appropriate medium for documenting systems and processes, I
will not say anything more here on how to use Git with MozReview.</p>
<p>Somewhat related to the introduction of Git support is an improved
mechanism for mapping commits to existing review requests.</p>
<p>When you submit commits to MozReview, MozReview has to decide how
to <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/commits.html#understanding-how-commits-are-mapped-to-review-requests">map</a>
those commits to review requests in Review Board. It has to choose
whether to recycle an existing review request or create a new one.
When recycling, is has to pick an appropriate one. If it chooses
incorrectly, wonky things can happen. For example, a review request
could switch to tracking a new and completely unrelated commit. That's
bad.</p>
<p>Up until today, our commit mapping algorithm was extremely simple. Yet
it seemed to work 90% of the time. However, a number of people
found the cracks and complained. With Git support coming online,
I had a feeling that Git users would find these cracks with higher
frequency than Mercurial users due to what I perceive to be
variations in the commit workflows of Git versus Mercurial. So,
I decided to proactively improve the commit mapping before the Git
users had time to complain.</p>
<p><strong>Both the Git and Mercurial MozReview client-side extensions now insert
a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> metadata line in commit messages.</strong> This line
effectively defines a (likely) unique ID that identifies the commit
across rewrites. When MozReview maps commits to review requests,
it uses this identifier to find matches. What this means is that
history rewriting (such as reordering commits) should be handled
well by MozReview and should not confuse the commit mapping
mechanism.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming the commit mapping mechanism is perfect. In fact,
I know of areas where it can still fall apart. But it is much
better than it was before. If you think you found a bug in the
commit mapping, don't hesitate to
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=MozReview">file a bug</a>.
Please have it block <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1243483">bug 1243483</a>.</p>
<p>A side-effect of introducing this improved commit mapping is that
commit messages will have a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> line in them. This
may startle some. Some may complain about the <em>spam</em>. Unfortunately,
there's no better alternative. Both Mercurial and Git do support a
hidden key-value dictionary for each commit object. In fact, the
MozReview Mercurial extension has been storing the very commit IDs
that now appear in the commit message in this dictionary for months!
Unfortunately, actually using this hidden dictionary for metadata
storage is riddled with problems. For example, some Mercurial
commands don't preserve all the metadata. And accessing or setting
this data from Git is painful. While I wish this metadata (which
provides little value to humans) were not located in the commit
message where humans could be bothered by it, it's really the only
practical place to put it. If people find it super annoying, we
could modify Autoland to strip it before landing. Although, I think
I like having it preserved because it will enable some useful
scenarios down the road, such as better workflows for uplift
requests. It's also worth noting that there is precedent for storing
unique IDs in commit messages for purposes of commit mapping in the
code review tool: <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11.5/user-changeid.html">Gerrit uses Change-ID lines</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the Git support and the more robust commit to review
request mapping mechanism!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I first started writing web services, I was a huge RESTful fan
boy. The architectural properties - especially the parts related to
caching and scalability - really jived with me. But as I've grown
older and gained experienced, I've realized that RESTful design,
like many aspects of software engineering, is more of a guideline
or ideal than a panacea. This post is about one of those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/webapi/">Review Board's Web API</a>
is RESTful. It's actually one of the better examples of a RESTful API
I've seen. There is a very clear separation between <em>resources</em>. And
everything - and I mean everything - is a resource. <em>Hyperlinks</em> are
used for the purposes described in Roy T. Fielding's dissertation.
I can tell the people who authored this web API understood RESTful
design and they succeeded in transferring that knowledge to a web API.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview code review tool</a>
is built on top of Review Board. We've made a number of customizations.
The most significant is the ability to submit a series of commits
as one logical review series. This occurs as a side-effect of a
<em>hg push</em> to the code review repository. Once your changesets
are pushed to the remote repository, that server issues a number of
Review Board Web API HTTP requests to reviewboard.mozilla.org to
create the review requests, assign reviewers, etc. This is mostly all
built on the built-in web API endpoints offered by Review Board.</p>
<p>Because Review Board's Web API adheres to RESTful design principles
so well, turning a series of commits into a series of review requests
takes a lot of HTTP requests. For each commit, we have to perform
something like 5 HTTP requests to define the server state. For
series of say 10 commits (which aren't uncommon since we try to
encourage the use of microcommits), this can add up to dozens of
HTTP requests! And that's just counting the HTTP requests to
Review Board: because we've integrated Review Board with Bugzilla,
events like publishing result in additional RESTful HTTP requests from
Review Board to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, submitting and publishing a series of 10
commits consumes somewhere between 75 and 100 HTTP requests! While
the servers are all in close physical proximity (read: low network
latencies), we are reusing TCP connections, and each HTTP request
completes fairly quickly, the overhead adds up. <strong>It's not uncommon
for publishing commit series to take over 30s.</strong> This is unacceptable
to developers. We want them to publish commits for review as quickly
as possible so they can get on with their next task. Humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>Over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229468">bug 1220468</a>,
I implemented a new batch submit web API for Review Board and converted
the Mercurial server to call it instead of the classic, RESTful Review
Board web APIs. <strong>In other words, I threw away the RESTful properties
of the web API and implemented a monolith API doing exactly what we
need.</strong> The result is a drastic reduction in net HTTP requests. In our
tests, submitting a series of 20 commits for review reduced the HTTP
request count by 104! Furthermore, the new API endpoint performs
all modifications in a single database transaction. Before, each HTTP
request was independent and we had bugs where failures in the middle of
a HTTP request series left the server in inconsistent and unexpected
state. The new API is significantly faster and more atomic as a bonus.
The main reason the new implementation isn't yet nearly instantaneous
is because we're still performing several RESTful HTTP requests to
Bugzilla from Review Board. But there are plans for Bugzilla to
implement the batch APIs we need as well, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>(I don't want to blame the Review Board or Bugzilla maintainers for
their RESTful web APIs that are giving MozReview a bit of scaling pain.
MozReview is definitely abusing them almost certainly in ways that
weren't imagined when they were conceived. To their credit, the
maintainers of both products have recognized the limitations in their
APIs and are working to address them.)</p>
<p>As much as I still love the properties of RESTful design, there are
practical limitations and consequences such as what I described
above. The older and more experienced I get, the less patience I have
for tolerating architecturally pure implementations that sacrifice
important properties, such as ease of use and performance.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the properties of RESTful design are
applicable to <em>microservices</em> as well. When you create a new service
in a microservices architecture, you are creating more overhead for
clients that need to speak to multiple services, making changes less
transactional and atomic, and making it difficult to consolidate
multiple related requests into a higher-level, simpler, and performant
API. I recommend
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">Microservice Trade-Offs</a>
for more on this subject.</p>
<p>There is a place in the world for RESTful and microservice
architectures. And as someone who does a lot of server-side engineering,
I sympathize with wanting scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. But
like most complex problems, you need to be cognizant of trade-offs. It is
also important to not get too caught up with architectural purity if
it is getting in the way of delivering a simple, intuitive, and fast
product for your users. So, please, follow me down from the ivory tower.
The air was cleaner up there - but that was only because it was so
distant from the swamp at the base of the tower that surrounds every
software project.</p>

  <p>Starting today, a Mozilla LDAP account with Mercurial SSH access is no
longer required to <em>hg push</em> into
<a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview</a> to initiate code review
with Mozilla projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install.html">instructions for configuring your client to use MozReview</a>
have been updated to reflect how you can now push to MozReview over HTTP
using a Bugzilla API Key for authentication.</p>
<p>This change effectively enables first-time contributors to use MozReview
for code review. Before, you had to obtain an LDAP account and configure
your SSH client, both of which could be time consuming processes and
therefore discourage people from contributing. (Or you could just use
Bugzilla/Splinter and not get the benefits of MozReview, which many
did.)</p>
<p><strong>I encourage others to update contribution docs to start nudging people
towards MozReview over Bugzilla/patch-based workflows</strong> (such as
bzexport).</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As of today, ~15.6% of commits landing in Firefox in July have gone
through <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> or have been produced
on machines that have used MozReview. This is still a small percentage
of overall commits. But, signs are that the percentage is going up. Last
month, about half as many commits exhibited the same signature. It's
only July 16 and we've already passed the total from June.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the differences between commits that have
gone through MozReview versus the rest. When you look at the diff
statistics (a quick proxy of change size), we find that MozReview
commits tend to be smaller. The median <em>adds</em> as reported by diff stat
(basically lines that were changed) is 12 for MozReview versus 17
elsewhere. The average is 58 for MozReview versus 100 elsewhere. For
number of files modified, MozReview averages 2.59 versus elsewhere's
2.71. (These numbers exclude some specific large commits that appeared to
be bulk imports of external projects and drove up the non-MozReview
figures.)</p>
<p>It's entirely possible the root cause behind the discrepancy is a
side-effect of the population of MozReview users: perhaps MozReview
users just write smaller commits. However, I'd like to think it's because
MozReview makes it easier to manage multiple commits and people are taking
advantage of that (this is an explicit design goal of MozReview). Whatever
the root cause, I'm glad diffs are smaller.
As I've <a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written about before</a>,
smaller commits are easier to review and land, thus enabling projects to
move faster.</p>
<p>I have a quarterly goal to remove the requirement for a Mozilla LDAP
account to push to MozReview. That will allow first time contributors to
use MozReview. This will be a huge win, as we can do much more magic in
the MozReview world than we can from vanilla Bugzilla (automatic bug
filing, automatic reviewer assignment, etc). Unofficially, I'd like to
have more than 50% of Firefox commits go through MozReview by the end of
the year.</p>

  <p>A lot of people contributed some really great feedback about MozReview
at Whistler. One of the most frequent requests was for the ability to
publish submitted review requests without having to open a browser.
I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday, this feature is implemented!
If reviewers have been assigned to all your review requests, Mercurial
will now prompt you to publish the review requests during <em>hg push</em>.
It should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we also introduced more advanced feature
negotiation into the handshake between client and server. This means
we now have a mechanism for detecting out-of-date client installations.
This will enable us to more aggressively drop backwards compatibility
(making server-side development easier) while simultaneously ensuring
that more people are running modern and hopefully better versions of the
client code. This should translate to moving faster and a better
experience for everyone.</p>
