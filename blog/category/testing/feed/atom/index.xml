    <content type="html" xml:base="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/05/10/better-sharing-of-test-code-in-mozilla-projects"><![CDATA[<p>Just <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&amp;rev=b063ba6dd084">landed</a>
in mozilla-inbound (Firefox's integration tree) is
support for test-only JavaScript modules. That is, JavaScript modules
that are utilized by just test code. This is being tracked in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748490">bug 748490</a>.</p>
<p>The use case for this feature is sharing common test code, mock types,
etc between tests. For example, in the Services code, we have a number
of mock types (like a JS implementation of the Sync HTTP server) that
need to be utilized across sub-modules. With test-only modules, it is
now possible to publish these modules to a common location and import
them using the familiar Cu.import() syntax. Previously, you had to
perform the equivalent of a <em>#include</em> (possibly by utilizing the
<em>[head]</em> section of xpcshell.ini files). The previous method of
importing is dirty because you pollute the global object. Furthermore,
it is really inconvenient when you wish to utilize shared files from
different directories. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/f80568dba010/services/sync/tests/unit/xpcshell.ini#l2">this file</a>
for an example.</p>
<p>The new method of publishing and consuming test-only JavaScript modules
is clean and simple. From your Makefile, define <strong>TESTING_JS_MODULES</strong> to
a list of (JavaScript) files to publish. Optionally, define
<strong>TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR</strong> to the relative path they should be published
to. If the directory variable is not defined, they will be published to
the root directory. Here is an example Makefile.in:</p>
<pre><code>DEPTH     = ../..
topsrcdir = @top_srcdir@
srcdir    = @srcdir@

include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

TESTING_JS_MODULES = mockserver.js common.js
TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR = foobar
</code></pre>
<p>All test modules are installed to a common directory somewhere in the
object directory. Where is not relevant. Just know it is outside the
normal distribution directory, so the test modules aren't packaged. This
common directory is registered with the resource manager under
<em>resource://testing/</em>. So, once a build is performed, you can import these
files via Components.utils.import():</p>
<pre><code>Cu.import("resource://testing-common/foobar/mockserver.js");
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this feature facilitates better reuse of test code. So, next time
you are writing test code, please consider writing writing and publishing it
as a module so others can utilize it.</p>
<p>One more thing. Currently, integration with the resource manager is only
implemented for xpcshell tests. I'd like to see this supported in all
the test runners eventually. I implemented xpcshell support because a)
that is the test harness I use almost exclusively and b) it is the only
one I'm comfortable modifying. If you want to implement support in
another test runner, please have a go at it!</p>]]></content>
