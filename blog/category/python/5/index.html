  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Over the winter break, I set out on an ambitious project to create
a service to help developers and others manage the flury
of patches going into Firefox. While the project is far from complete,
I'm ready to unleash the first part of the project upon the world.</p>
<p>If you point your browsers to
<a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/">moztree.gregoryszorc.com</a>, you'll
hopefully see some documentation about what I've built.
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/moz-tree-utopia">Source code</a> is
available and free, of course. Patches very welcome.</p>
<p>Essentially, I built a centralized indexing service for version
control repositories with Mozilla's extra metadata thrown in.
I tell it what repositories to mirror, and it clones everything,
fetches data such as the pushlog and Git SHA-1 mappings, and
stores everything in a central database. It then exposes this
aggregated data through world-readable web services.</p>
<p>Currently, I have the service indexing the popular project branches
for Firefox (central, aurora, beta, release, esr, b2g, inbound, fx-team,
try, etc). You can view the
<a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/repos">full list</a> via the web
service. As a bonus, I'm also serving these repositories via
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/">hg.gregoryszorc.com</a>. My server appears
to be significantly faster than
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org">hg.mozilla.org</a>. If you want to use it for
your daily needs, go for it. I make no SLA guarantees, however.</p>
<p>I'm also using this service as an opportunity to experiment with
alternate forms of Mercurial hosting. I have mirrors of mozilla-central
and the try repository with generaldelta and lz4 compression enabled.
I may blog about what those are eventually. The teaser is that they can
make Mercurial perform a lot faster under some conditions. I'm also
using ZFS under the hood to manage repositories. Each repository is a
ZFS filesystem. This means I can create repository copies on the server
(user repositories anyone?) at a nearly free cost. Contrast this to the
traditional method of full clones, which take lots of time, memory, CPU,
and storage.</p>
<p>Anyway, some things you can do with the existing web service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain metadata about Mercurial changesets.
  <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/changeset/940b2974f35b">Example</a>.</li>
<li>Look up metadata about Git commits.
  <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/git-sha1/40438af67c321">Example</a>.</li>
<li>Obtain a <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/spore">SPORE descriptor</a>
  describing the web service endpoints. This allows you to auto-generate
  clients from descriptors. Yay!</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, that's not a lot. But adding new endpoints is relatively
straightforward. See the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/moz-tree-utopia/src/tip/repodata/web/app.py">source</a>.
It's literally as easy as defining a URL mapping and writing a
database query.</p>
<p>The performance is also not the best. I just haven't put in the effort
to tune things yet. All of the querying hits the database, not
Mercurial. So, making things faster should merely be a matter of
database and hosting optimization. Patches welcome!</p>
<p>Some ideas that I haven't had time to implement yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return changests in a specific repository</li>
<li>Return recently pushed changesets</li>
<li>Return pushes for a given user</li>
<li>Return commits for a given author</li>
<li>Return commits referencing a given bug</li>
<li>Obtain TBPL URLs for pushes with changeset</li>
<li>Integrate bugzilla metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those are in place, I foresee this service powering a number of
dashboards. Patches welcome.</p>
<p>Again, this service is only the tip of what's possible. There's a lot
that could be built on this service. I have ideas. Others have ideas.</p>
<p>The project includes a Vagrant file and Puppet
manifests for provisioning the server. It's a one-liner to get a
development environment up and running. It should be really easy to
contribute to this project. Patches welcome.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I see a number of open source projects supporting old versions
of Python. Mercurial supports 2.4, for example. I have to ask: why do
projects continue to support old Python releases?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.4.6/">Python 2.4</a> was last
  released on December 19, 2008 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.5.6/">Python 2.5</a> was last
  released on May 26, 2011 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.5</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.9/">Python 2.6</a> was last
  released on October 29, 2013 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.6</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Everything before Python 2.7 is end-of-lifed</strong></li>
<li>Python 2.7 continues to see periodic releases, but mostly for bug fixes.</li>
<li>Practically all of the work on CPython is happening in the 3.3 and 3.4
  branches. Other implementations continue to support 2.7.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 has been available since July 2010</li>
<li>Python 2.7 provides some very compelling language features over
  earlier releases that developers want to use</li>
<li>It's much easier to write dual compatible 2/3 Python when 2.7 is the
  only 2.x release considered.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 can be installed in userland relatively easily (see
  projects like <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these facts, I'm not sure why projects insist on supporting old
and end-of-lifed Python releases.</p>
<p><strong>I think maintainers of Python projects should seriously consider
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below.</strong> Are there really that many
people on systems that don't have Python 2.7 easily available? Why are
we Python developers inflicting so much pain on ourselves to support
antiquated Python releases?</p>
<p>As a data point, I successfully transitioned Firefox's build system
from requiring Python 2.5+ to 2.7.3+ and it was relatively
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/djN02O03APc/OS8A9LuHX0sJ">pain</a>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870420">free</a>.
Sure, a few people complained. But as far as I know, not very many new
developers are coming in and complaining about the requirement.
If we can do it with a few thousand developers, I'm guessing your
project can as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-01-09 16:05:00 PST</strong>: This post is being discussed on
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/01/09/1940232/why-do-projects-continue-to-support-old-python-releases">Slashdot</a>. A lot of the comments
talk about Python 3. Python 3 is its own set of
considerations. The intended focus of this post is strictly about
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below. Python 3 is related
in that porting Python 2.x to Python 3 is much easier the higher
the Python 2.x version. This especially holds true when you want
to write Python that works simultaneously in both 2.x and 3.x.</p>

  <p>I have a number of Python projects and tools that interact with

<p>I have consolidated all these Python modules into a unified source

<p>Currently included in the Python package are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client for <a href="https://treestatus.mozilla.org/">treestatus.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>Module for extracting cookies from Firefox profiles (useful for
  programmatically getting Bugzilla auth credentials).</li>

  <small>May 14, 2012 at 12:05 AM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/python'>Python</a>, <a href='/blog/category/clang'>Clang</a>, <a href='/blog/category/compilers'>compilers</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> 3.1 is scheduled to be released any hour
now. And, I'm proud to say that I've contributed to it! Specifically,
I've contributed improvements to the Python bindings, which are an
interface to
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html">libclang</a>, the C
interface to Clang.</p>
<p>Since 3.1 is being released today, I wanted to share some of the new
features in this release. An exhaustive list of newly supported APIs is
available in the
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#pythonchanges">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Diagnostic Metadata</h2>
<p><em>Diagnostics</em> are how Clang represents warnings and errors during
compilation. The Python bindings
now allow you to get at more metadata. Of particilar interest is
<strong>Diagnostic.option</strong>. This property allows you to see the compiler flag
that triggered the diagnostic. Or, you could query
<strong>Diagnostic.disable_option</strong> for the compiler flag that would silence
this diagnostic.</p>
<p>These might be useful if you are analyzing diagnostics produced by the
compiler. For example, you could parse source code using the Python
bindings and collect aggregate information on all the diagnostics
encountered.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import Index

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('hello.c')

for diag in tu.diagnostics:
    print diag.severity
    print diag.location
    print diag.spelling
    print diag.option
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you are using the Python bindings from trunk:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import TranslationUnit

tu = TranslationUnit.from_source('hello.c')
...
</code></pre>
<p>Sadly, the patch that enabled this simpler usage did not make the 3.1
branch.</p>
<h2>Finding Entities from Source Location</h2>
<p>Two new APIs, <strong>SourceLocation.from_position</strong> and
<strong>Cursor.from_location</strong>, allow you to easily extract a cursor in the AST
from any arbitrary point in a file.</p>
<p>Say you want to find the element in the AST that occupies column 6 of
line #10 in the file <em>foo.c</em>:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import Cursor
from clang.cindex import Index
from clang.cindex import SourceLocation

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('foo.c')

f = File.from_name(tu, 'foo.c')

location = SourceLocation.from_position(tu, f, 10, 6)
cursor = Cursor.from_location(tu, location)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you could do this by iterating over cursors in the AST until
one with the desired source range is found. But, that would involve more
API calls.</p>
<p>I would like to say that these APIs feel klunky to me. There is lots of
redundancy in there. In my opinion, there should just be a
<strong>TranslationUnit.get_cursor(file='foo.c', line=10, column=6)</strong> that
does the right thing. Maybe that will make it into a future release.
Maybe it won't. After all, the Python bindings are really a thin wrapper
around the C API and an argument can be made that there should be
minimal extra logic and complexity in the Python bindings. Time will
tell.</p>
<h2>Type Metadata</h2>
<p>It is now possible to access more metadata on <strong>Type</strong> instances. For
example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>See what the elements of an array are using <strong>Type.get_array_element_type</strong></li>
<li>See how many elements are in a static array using
  <strong>Type.get_array_element_count</strong></li>
<li>Determine if a function is variadic using <strong>Type.is_function_variadic</strong></li>
<li>Inspect the Types of function arguments using <strong>Type.argument_types</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, I will show how to iterate over all the functions
declared in a file and to inspect their arguments.</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import CursorKind
from clang.cindex import Index
from clang.cindex import TypeKind

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('hello.c')

for cursor in tu.cursor.get_children():
    # Ignore AST elements not from the main source file (e.g.
    # from included files).
    if not cursor.location.file or cursor.location.file.name != 'hello.c':
        continue

    # Ignore AST elements not a function declaration.
    if cursor.kind != CursorKind.FUNCTION_DECL:
        continue

    # Obtain the return Type for this function.
    result_type = cursor.type.get_result()

    print 'Function: %s' % cursor.spelling
    print '  Return type: %s' % result_type.kind.spelling
    print '  Arguments:'

    # Function has no arguments.
    if cursor.type.kind == TypeKind.FUNCTIONNOPROTO:
        print '    None'
        continue

    for arg_type in cursor.argument_types():
        print '    %s' % arg_type.kind.spelling
</code></pre>
<p>This example is overly simplified. A more robust solution would also
inspect the Type instances to see if they are constants, check for
pointers, check for variadic functions, etc.</p>
<p>An example application of these APIs is to build a tool which
automatically generated
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> or similar
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>
bindings. Many of these tools today use custom parsers. Why invent a
custom (and likely complex) parser when you can call out into Clang and
have it to all the heavy lifting for you?</p>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<p>As I write this, there are already a handful of Python binding features
checked into Clang's SVN trunk that were made after the 3.1 branch was cut.
And, I'm actively working at integrating many more.</p>
<p>Still to come to the Python bindings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better memory management support (currently, not all references are
  kept everywhere, so it is possible for a GC to collect and dispose of
  objects that should be alive, even though they are not in scope).</li>
<li>Support for token API (lexer output)</li>
<li>More complete coverage of Cursor and Type APIs</li>
<li>More friendly APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a personal goal for the Python bindings to cover 100% of the
functionality in libclang. My work towards that goal is captured in my
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/clang/tree/python_features/">python features</a>
branch on GitHub. I periodically clean up a patch, submit it for review,
apply feedback, and commit. That branch is highly volatile and I do
rebase. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to add additional functionality to libclang
[and expose it to Python]. For example, I would love for libclang to
support code generation (i.e. compiling), not just parsing. This would
enable all kinds of nifty scenarios (like channeling your build system's
compiler calls through a proxy which siphons off metadata such as
diagnostics).</p>
<h2>Credits and Getting Involved</h2>
<p>I'm not alone in my effort to improve Clang's Python bindings.
Anders Waldenborg has landed a number of patches to add functionality
and tests. He has also been actively reviewing patches and implementing
official LLVM Python bindings! On the reviewing front, Manuel Klimek has been
invaluable. I've lost track of how many bugs he's caught and good
suggestions he's made. Tobias Grosser and Chandler Carruth have also
reviewed their fair share of patches and handled community contributions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the Python bindings, we could
use your help! You can find me in <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/#irc">#llvm</a> as
IndyGreg. If I'm not around, the LLVM community is generally pretty helpful,
so I'm sure you'll get an answer. If you prefer email, send it to the
<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev</a> list.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, leave them in the comments or ask using one
of the methods above.</p>
