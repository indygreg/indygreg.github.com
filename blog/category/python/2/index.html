  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I am very pleased to announce the 0.7 release of
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyOxidizer</a>, a modern
Python application packaging tool.</p>
<p>There are a host of notable new features in this release. You can
read all about them in the project
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>I want to use this blog post to call out the more meaningful ones.</p>
<p>I started PyOxidizer as a science experiment of sorts: I sat out to
prove the hypothesis that it was possible to produce high performance
single file executables embedding Python and all of its resources
(Python modules, non-module resource files, compiled extensions, etc).
PyOxidizer has achieved this on Windows, Linux, and macOS since its
very earliest releases. Hypothesis confirmed!</p>
<p>In order to actually achieve single file executables, you have to
fundamentally change aspects of Python's behavior. Some of these
changes invalidate deeply rooted assumptions about how Python works,
such as the existence of <code>__file__</code> in modules. As you can imagine,
these broken assumptions translated to numerous compatibility issues
and PyOxidizer didn't work with many popular Python packages.</p>
<p>With the science experiment phase of PyOxidizer out of the way, I
have been making a concerted effort to broaden the user base of
PyOxidizer. While single file executables can be an amazing property,
it isn't critical for many use cases and the issues it was causing
were preventing people from exploring PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>This brings us to what I think are the major new features in
PyOxidizer 0.7.</p>
<h2>Better Support for Loading Extension Modules</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer insisted that you compile Python
(C) extension modules from source and statically link them into
a produced binary. This requirement prevented the use of pre-built
extension modules (commonly found in Python binary wheels available
on PyPI) with PyOxidizer, forcing people to compile them locally.
While this often <em>just worked</em> for many extension modules, it
frequently failed on complex extension modules and it frequently
failed on Windows.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer now supports loading compiled extension modules from
standalone files (typically <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code> files, which are actually
shared libraries). There are still some sharp edges and known
deficiencies. But in many cases, if you tell PyOxidizer to run
<code>pip install</code> and package the result, pre-built wheels can be
installed and PyOxidizer will pick up the standalone files.</p>
<p>On Windows, PyOxidizer even supports embedding the shared library
data into the produced <code>.exe</code> and loading the <code>.pyd</code>/DLL directly
from memory.</p>
<h2>Loading Resources from the Filesystem</h2>
<p>Binaries built with PyOxidizer contain a blob holding an index
of available Python resources along with their data.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer only allowed you to define resources
as <em>in-memory</em>. If the resource was defined in this blob, it was
imported from memory. Otherwise it wasn't known to PyOxidizer.
You could still install files next to the produced binary and
tell PyOxidizer to enable Python's default filesystem-based
importer. But PyOxidizer didn't explicitly know about these
files on the filesystem.</p>
<p>In PyOxidizer 0.7, the blob index of Python resources is able to
express different <em>locations</em> for that resource. Currently, a
resource can have its data made available <em>in-memory</em> or
<em>filesystem-relative</em>. <em>in-memory</em> works as before: the raw
data is embedded next to the next in memory and loaded from
there (using 0-copy). <em>filesystem-relative</em> encodes a filesystem
path to the resource. During packaging, PyOxidizer will place
the resource next to the executable (using a typical Python
file layout scheme) and store the relative path to that resource
in the resources index.</p>
<p>The <em>filesystem-relative</em> resource indexing feature has a few
implications for PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>First, it is more standard. When PyOxidizer loads a Python
module from the filesystem, it sets <code>__file__</code>, <code>__path__</code>,
etc and the module semantics should behave as if the file
were imported by Python's standard importer. This means that
if a package is having issues with <em>in-memory</em> importing, you
can simply fall back to <em>filesystem-relative</em> to get standard
Python behavior and everything should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>Second, PyOxidizer's filesystem resource loading is faster
than Python's! When Python's standard importer goes to
<code>import</code> a module, it needs to <code>stat()</code> various paths to
first locate the file. It then performs some sanity checking
and other minor actions before actually importing the module.
All of this has overhead. Since the goal of PyOxidizer is
to produce standalone applications and applications should
be immutable, PyOxidizer can avoid most of this overhead.
PyOxidizer simply tries to <code>open()</code> and <code>read()</code> the relative
path baked into the resource index at build time. If that
works, the resource is loaded. Else there is a failure.
The code path in PyOxidizer to locate a Python resource
is effectively a lookup in a Rust <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;str, T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to isolate the performance
benefits of this new feature. I ran Mercurial's test harness
with different variants of <code>hg</code> on Linux on my Ryzen 3950X.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>traditional</em> - A <code>hg</code> script with a <code>#!/path/to/python3.7</code> shebang.</li>
<li><em>oxidized</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer, without
  PyOxidizer's custom module importer.</li>
<li><em>filesystem</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer using the
  new filesystem-relative resource index.</li>
<li><em>in-memory</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer with all
  resources loaded from memory (how PyOxidizer has traditionally worked).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are quite clear:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variant</th><th>CPU Time (s)</th><th>Delta (s)</th><th>% Orig</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>traditional</td><td style="text-align: right">11,287</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>oxidized</td><td style="text-align: right">10,735</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">95.1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>filesystem</td><td style="text-align: right">10,186</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,101</td><td style="text-align: right">90.2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>in-memory</td><td style="text-align: right">9,883</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,404</td><td style="text-align: right">87.6</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We see a nice win just from using a native executable built
with PyOxidizer (<em>traditional</em> to <em>oxidized</em>).</p>
<p>Then from <em>oxidized</em> to <em>filesystem</em> we see another jump of
~5%. This difference is attributed to using PyOxidizer's
Rust-powered importer with an index of resources available
on the filesystem. In other words, all that work that Python's
standard importer is doing to discover files and then operate
on them is non-trivial!</p>
<p>Finally, the smaller jump from <em>filesystem</em> to <em>in-memory</em>
isolates the benefits of importing resource data from
memory instead of involving filesystem I/O. (Filesystems
are generally slow.) While I haven't measured explicitly,
I hypothesize that macOS and Windows will see a bigger
jump between these two variants, as the filesystem
performance on these platforms generally isn't as good
as it is on Linux.</p>
<h2>PyOxidizer's Future</h2>
<p>With PyOxidizer now supporting a couple of much-needed
features to support a broader set of users, I'm hoping that
future releases of PyOxidizer continue to broaden the utility
of PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>The over-arching goal of PyOxidizer is to solve large aspects
of the Python application packaging and distribution problem.
So far a lot of focus has been spent on the former. PyOxidizer
in its current form can materialize files on the filesystem
that you can copy or package up manually and distribute. But
I want these processes to be part of PyOxidizer: I want it to
be possible for PyOxidizer to emit a Windows MSI installer, a
macOS dmg, a Debian package, etc for a Python application.</p>
<p>In order to support the aforementioned marquee features
of this PyOxidizer release, I had to pay down a lot of
technical debt in the code base left over from the science
experiment phase of PyOxidizer's inception.</p>
<p>In the short term, I plan to continue shoring up the code base
and rounding out support for features requested in the
issue tracker on GitHub. The next release of PyOxidizer will
also <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/234">likely require</a>
Python 3.8, as this will improve run-time control over the
embedded Python interpreter and enable PyOxidizer to better
support package metadata (<code>importlib.metadata</code>), enabling
support for features like <em>entry points</em>.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about extracting PyOxidizer's custom
module importer to be usable as a standalone Python extension
module. I think there's some value in publishing a
<code>pyoxidizer_importer</code> package on PyPI that you can easily
add to your installed packages to speed up Python's
standard filesystem importer by a few percent. If nothing else,
this may drum up interest in the larger Python community for
standardizing a format for serializing Python resources in a
single file. Perhaps we can get other Python packaging tools
producing the same
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packed-resources">packed resources data</a>
blob that PyOxidizer uses so we can all standardize on a
more efficient mechanism for loading Python modules. Time
will tell.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new release. File issues at

  <p>Mercurial 5.2 was released on November 5, 2019. It is the first version
of Mercurial that supports Python 3. This milestone comes nearly 11 years
after Python 3.0 was first released on December 3, 2008.</p>
<p>Speaking as a maintainer of Mercurial and an avid user of Python, I
feel like the experience of making Mercurial work with Python 3 is
worth sharing because there are a number of lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>This post is logically divided into two sections: a mostly factual recount
of Mercurial's Python 3 porting effort and a more opinionated commentary
of the transition to Python 3 and the Python language ecosystem as a whole.
Those who don't care about the mechanics of porting a large Python project
to Python 3 may want to skip the next section or two.</p>
<h2>Porting Mercurial to Python 3</h2>
<p>Let's start with a brief history lesson of Mercurial's support for
Python 3 as told by its own commit history.</p>
<p>The Mercurial version control tool was first released in April 2005
(the same month that Git was initially released). Version 1.0 came out
in March 2008. The first reference to Python 3 I found in the code base
was in <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/8fee8ff13d37">September 2008</a>.
Then not much happens for a while until
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/4494fb02d549">June 2010</a>, when
someone authors a bunch of changes to make the Python C extensions
start to recognize Python 3. Then things were again quiet for a while
until <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/56ef99fbd6f2">January 2013</a>,
when a handful of changes landed to remove 2 argument <code>raise</code>. There were
a handful of commits in 2014 but nothing worth calling out.</p>
<p>Mercurial's meaningful journey to Python 3 started in 2015. In code,
the work started in
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/af6e6a0781d7">April 2015</a>, with
effort to make Mercurial's test harness run with Python 3. Part of
this was a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/fefc72523491">decision</a>
that Python 3.5 (to be released several months later in September 2015)
would be the minimum Python 3 version that Mercurial would support.</p>
<p>Once the Mercurial Project decided it wanted to port to Python 3 (as opposed
to another language), one of the earliest decisions was how to perform that
port. <strong>Mercurial's code base was too large to attempt a flag day conversion</strong>
where there would be a Python 2 version and a Python 3 version and one day
everyone would switch from Python 2 to 3. <strong>Mercurial needed a way to run the
same code (or as much of the same code) on both Python 2 and 3.</strong> We would
maintain a single code base and users would gradually switch from running with
Python 2 to Python 3.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/e1fb276d4619">May 2015</a>,
Mercurial dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5. Dropping support for
these older Python versions was critical, as it was effectively impossible to
write Python code that ran on this wide gamut of versions because of
incompatibilities in syntax and language features. For example, you needed
Python 2.6 to get <code>print()</code> via <code>from __future__ import print_function</code>.
The project's late start at a Python 3 port can be significantly attributed
to Python 2.4 and 2.5 compatibility holding us back.</p>
<p>The main goal with Mercurial's early porting work was just getting the code base
to a point where <code>import mercurial</code> would work. There were a myriad of places
where Mercurial used syntax that was invalid on Python 3 and Python 3
couldn't even parse the source code, let alone compile it to bytecode and
execute it.</p>
<p>This effort began in earnest in
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/e93036747902">June 2015</a>
with global source code rewrites like using modern octal syntax,
modern exception catching syntax (<code>except Exception as e</code> instead of
<code>except Exception, e</code>), <code>print()</code> instead of <code>print</code>, and a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/1a6a117d0b95">modern import convention</a>
along with the use of <code>from __future__ import absolute_import</code>.</p>
<p>In the early days of the port, our first goal was to get all source code
parsing as valid Python 3. The next step was to get all the modules <code>import</code>ing
cleanly. This entailed fixing code that ran at <code>import</code> time to work on
Python 3. Our thinking was that we would need the code base to be <code>import</code>
clean on Python 3 before seriously thinking about run-time behavior. In reality,
we quickly ported a lot of modules to <code>import</code> cleanly and then moved on
to higher-level porting, leaving a long-tail of modules with <code>import</code> failures.</p>
<p>This initial porting effort played out over months. There weren't many
people working on it in the early days: a few people would basically hack on
Python 3 as a form of itch scratching and most of the project's energy was
focused on improving the existing Python 2 based product. You can get a rough
idea of the timeline and participation in the early porting effort through the
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/log/081a77df7bc6/tests/test-check-py3-compat.t?revcount=960">history of test-check-py3-compat.t</a>.
We see the test being added in <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/40eb385f798f">December 2015</a>,
By June 2016, most of the code base was ported to our modern import convention
and we were ready to move on to more meaningful porting.</p>
<p>One of the biggest early hurdles in our porting effort was how to overcome
the string literals type mismatch between Python 2 and 3. In Python 2, a
<code>''</code> string literal is a sequence of bytes. In Python 3, a <code>''</code> string literal
is a sequence of Unicode code points. These are fundamentally different types.
And in Mercurial's code base, <strong>most of our <em>string</em> types are binary by design:
use of a Unicode based <code>str</code> for representing data is flat out wrong for our use
case</strong>. We knew that Mercurial would need to eventually switch many string
literals from <code>''</code> to <code>b''</code> to preserve type compatibility. But doing so would
be problematic.</p>
<p>In the early days of Mercurial's Python 3 port in 2015, Mercurial's project
maintainer (Matt Mackall) set a ground rule that the Python 3 port shouldn't overly
disrupt others: he wanted the Python 3 port to more or less happen in the background
and not require every developer to be aware of Python 3's low-level behavior in order
to get work done on the existing Python 2 code base. This may seem like a questionable
decision (and I probably disagreed with him to some extent at the time because I was
doing Python 3 porting work and the decision constrained this work). But it was the
correct decision. Matt knew that it would be years before the Python 3 port was either
necessary or resulted in a meaningful return on investment (the value proposition of
Python 3 has always been weak to Mercurial because Python 3 doesn't demonstrate a
compelling advantage over Python 2 for our use case). What Matt was trying to do was
minimize the externalized costs that a Python 3 port would inflict on the project.
He correctly recognized that maintaining the existing product and supporting
existing users was more important than a long-term bet in its infancy.</p>
<p>This ground rule meant that a mass insertion of <code>b''</code> prefixes everywhere
was not desirable, as that would require developers to think about whether
a type was a <code>bytes</code> or <code>str</code>, a distinction they didn't have to worry about
on Python 2 because we practically never used the Unicode-based string type in
Mercurial.</p>
<p>In addition, there were some other practical issues with doing a bulk <code>b''</code>
prefix insertion. One was that the added <code>b</code> characters would cause a lot of lines
to grow beyond our length limits and we'd have to reformat code. That would
require manual intervention and would significantly slow down porting. And
a sub-issue of adding all the <code>b</code> prefixes and reformatting code is that it would
<em>break</em> annotate/blame more than was tolerable. The latter issue was addressed
by teaching Mercurial's annotate/blame feature to <em>skip</em> revisions. The project
now has a convention of annotating commit messages with <code># skip-blame &lt;reason&gt;</code>
so structural only changes can easily be ignored when performing an
annotate/blame.</p>
<p>A stop-gap solution to the <code>b''</code> everywhere issue came in
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/1c22400db72d">July 2016</a>, when I
introduced a custom Python module importer that rewrote source code as part
of <code>import</code> when running on Python 3. (I have
<a href="/blog/2017/03/13/from-__past__-import-bytes_literals/">previously blogged</a>
about this hack.) What this did was transparently add <code>b''</code> prefixes to all
un-prefixed string literals as well as modify how a few common functions were
called so that we wouldn't need to modify source code so things would run natively
on Python 3. The source transformer allowed us to have the benefits of progressing
in our Python 3 port without having to rewrite tens of thousands of lines of
source code. The solution was hacky. But it enabled us to make significant
progress on the Python 3 port without externalizing a lot of cost onto others.</p>
<p>I thought the source transformer would be relatively short-lived and would be
removed shortly after the project inevitably decided to go all in on Python 3.
To my surprise, others built additional transforms over the years and the source
transformer persisted all the way until
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/d783f945a701">October 2019</a>, when
I removed it just before the first non-alpha Python 3 compatible version
of Mercurial was released.</p>
<p>A common problem Mercurial faced with making the code base dual Python 2/3 native
was dealing with standard library differences. Most of the problems stemmed
from changes between Python 2.7 and 3.5+. But there are changes within the
versions of Python 3 that we had to wallpaper over as well. In
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/6041fb8f2da8">April 2016</a>, the
<code>mercurial.pycompat</code> module was introduced to export aliases or wrappers around
standard library functionality to abstract the differences between Python
versions. This file <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/log/66af68d4c751/mercurial/pycompat.py?revcount=240">grew over time</a>
and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/66af68d4c751/mercurial/pycompat.py">eventually became</a>
Mercurial's version of <a href="https://six.readthedocs.io/">six</a>. To be honest, I'm
not sure if we should have used <code>six</code> from the beginning. <code>six</code> probably would
have saved some work. But we had to eventually write a lot of shims for
converting between <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code> and would have needed to invent a
<code>pycompat</code> layer in some form anyway. So I'm not sure <code>six</code> would have saved
enough effort to justify the baggage of integrating a 3rd party package into
Mercurial. (When Mercurial accepts a 3rd party package, downstream packagers
like Debian get all hot and bothered and end up making questionable patches
to our source code. So we prefer to minimize the surface area for
problems by minimizing dependencies on 3rd party packages.)</p>
<p>Once we had a source transforming module importer and the <code>pycompat</code>
compatibility shim, we started to focus in earnest on making core
functionality actually work on Python 3. We established a convention of
annotating changesets needed for Python 3 with <code>py3</code>, so a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/log?rev=desc(py3)&amp;revcount=4000">commit message search</a>
yields a lot of the history. (But it isn't a full history since not every Python 3
oriented change used this convention). We see from that history that after
the source importer landed, a lot of porting effort was spent on things
very early in the <code>hg</code> process lifetime. This included handling environment
variables, loading config files, and argument parsing. We introduced a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/log/@/tests/test-check-py3-commands.t">test-check-py3-commands.t</a>
test to track the progress of <code>hg</code> commands working in Python 3. The very early
history of that file shows the various error messages changing, as underlying
early process functionality was slowly ported to work on Python 3. By
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/2d555d753f0e">December 2016</a>, we
had <code>hg version</code> working on Python 3!</p>
<p>With basic <code>hg</code> command dispatch ported to Python 3 at the end of 2016,
2017 represented an inflection point in the Python 3 porting effort. With the
early process functionality working, different people could pick up different
commands and code paths and start making code work with Python 3. By
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/52ee1b5ac277">March 2017</a>, basic
repository opening and <code>hg files</code> worked. Shortly thereafter,
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/ed23f929af38">hg init started working as well</a>.
And <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/935a1b1117c7">hg status</a> and
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/aea8ec3f7dd1">hg commit</a> did as well.</p>
<p>Within a few months, enough of Mercurial's functionality was working with Python
3 that we started to <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/7a877e569ed6">track which tests passed on Python 3</a>.
The <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/log/@/contrib/python3-whitelist?revcount=480">evolution of this file</a>
shows a reasonable history of the porting velocity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/feb910d2f59b">May 2017</a>, we dropped
support for Python 2.6. This significantly reduced the complexity of supporting
Python 3, as there was tons of functionality in Python 2.7 that made it easier
to target both Python 2 and 3 and now our hands were untied to utilize it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/bd8875b6473c">November 2017</a>, I
landed a test harness feature to report exceptions seen during test runs. I
later <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/8de90e006c78">refined the output</a>
so the most frequent failures were reported more prominently. This feature
greatly enabled our ability to target the most common exceptions, allowing
us to write patches to fix the most prevalent issues on Python 3 and uncover
previously unknown failures.</p>
<p>By the end of 2017, we had most of the structural pieces in place to complete
the port. Essentially all that was required at that point was time and labor.
We didn't have a formal mechanism in place to target porting efforts. Instead,
people would pick up a component or test that they wanted to hack on and then
make incremental changes towards making that work. All the while, we didn't
have a strict policy on not regressing Python 3 and regressions in Python 3
porting progress were semi-frequent. Although we did tend to correct
regressions quickly. And over time, developers saw a flurry of Python 3
patches and slowly grew awareness of how to accommodate Python 3, and the
number of Python 3 regressions became less frequent.</p>
<p>As useful as the source-transforming module importer was, it incurred some
additional burden for the porting effort. The source transformer effectively
converted all un-prefixed string literals (<code>''</code>) to bytes literals (<code>b''</code>)
to preserve string type behavior with Python 2. But various aspects of Python
3 didn't like the existence of <code>bytes</code>. Various standard library functionality
now wanted unicode <code>str</code> and didn't accept <code>bytes</code>, even though the Python
2 implementation used the equivalent of <code>bytes</code>. So our <code>pycompat</code> layer
grew pretty large to accommodate calling into various standard library
functionality. Another side-effect which we didn't initially anticipate
was the <code>**kwargs</code> calling convention. Python allows you to use <code>**</code>
with a dict with string keys to turn those keys into named arguments
in a function call. But Python 3 requires these <code>dict</code> keys to be
<code>str</code> and outright rejects <code>bytes</code> keys, even if the <code>bytes</code> instance
is ASCII safe and has the same underlying byte representation of the
string data as the <code>str</code> instance would. So we had to invent support
functions that would convert <code>dict</code> keys from <code>bytes</code> to <code>str</code> for
use with <code>**kwargs</code> and another to convert a <code>**kwargs</code> dict from
<code>str</code> keys to <code>bytes</code> keys so we could use <code>''</code> syntax to access keys
in our source code! Also on the string type front, we had to sprinkle
the codebase with raw string literals (<code>r''</code>) to force the use of
<code>str</code> irregardless of which Python version you were running on (our
source transformer only changed unprefixed string literals, so existing
<code>r''</code> strings would be preserved as <code>str</code>).</p>
<p>Blind transformation of all string literals to <code>bytes</code> was less than ideal
and it did impose some unwanted side-effects. But, again, most <em>strings</em>
in Mercurial are bytes by design, so we thought it would be easier to
<em>byteify</em> all strings then selectively undo that where native strings
were actually warranted (like keys in most <code>dict</code>s) than to take the
up-front cost to examine every string and make an intelligent determination
as to what type it should be. I go back and forth as to whether this was the
correct call. But when you factor in that the source transforming
module importer unblocked Python 3 porting at a time in the project's
history when there was so much focus on improving the core product and it
did so without externalizing many costs onto the people doing the critical
core product work, I think it was the right call.</p>
<p>By mid 2019, the number of test failures in Python 3 had been whittled
down to a reasonable, less daunting number. It felt like victory was
in grasp and inevitable. But a few significant issues lingered.</p>
<p>One remaining question was around addressing differences between Python
3 versions. At the time, Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 were released and 3.8
was scheduled for release by the end of the year. We had a surprising
number of issues with differences in Python 3 versions. Many of us
were running Python 3.7, so it had the fewest failures. We had to spend
extra effort to get Python 3.5 and 3.6 working as well as 3.7. Same for
3.8.</p>
<p>Another task we deferred until the second half of 2019 was standing up
robust CI for Python 3. We had some coverage, but it was minimal. Wanting
a distraction from PyOxidizer for a bit and wanting to overhaul Mercurial's
CI system (which is officially built on Buildbot), I cobbled together a
<em>serverless</em> CI system built on top of AWS DynamoDB and S3 for storage,
Lambda functions and CloudWatch events for all business logic, and EC2 spot
instances for job execution. This CI system executed Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7,
and 3.8 variants of our test harness on Linux and Python 3.7 on Windows.
This gave developers insight into version-specific failures. More
importantly, it also gave insight into Windows failures, which was
previously not well tested. It was discovered that Python 3 on Windows was
lagging significantly behind POSIX.</p>
<p>By the time of the Mercurial developer meetup in October 2019, nearly
all tests were passing on POSIX platforms and we were confident that
we could declare Python 3 support as at least beta quality for the
Mercurial 5.2 release, planned for early November.</p>
<p>One of our blockers for ripping off the alpha label on Python 3 support
was removing our source-transforming module importer. It had performance
implications and it wasn't something we wanted to ship because it felt
too hacky. A blocker for this was we wanted to automatically format
our source tree with <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a>
because if we removed the source transformer, we'd have to rewrite
a lot of source code to apply changes the transformer was performing,
which would necessitate wrapping a lot of lines, which would involve a lot
of manual effort. We wanted to <em>blacken</em> our code base first so that
mass rewriting source code wouldn't involve a lot of tedious reformatting
since <code>black</code> would handle that for us automatically. And rewriting the
source tree with <code>black</code> was blocked on a specific feature landing in
<code>black</code>! (We did not agree with <code>black</code>'s behavior of
unwrapping comma-delimited lists of items if they could fit on a single
line. So one of our core contributors wrote a patch to <code>black</code> that
changed its behavior so a trailing <code>,</code> in a list of items will force
items to be formatted on multiple lines. I personally find the multiple line
formatting much easier to read. And the behavior is arguably better for
code review and <em>annotation</em>, which is line based.) Once this feature
landed in <code>black</code>, we reformatted our source tree and started ripping
out the source transformations, starting by inserting <code>b''</code> literals
everywhere. By late October, the source transformer was no more and
we were ready to release beta quality support for Python 3 (at least
on UNIX-like platforms).</p>
<p>Having described a mostly factual overview of Mercurial's port to Python
3, it is now time to shift gears to the speculative and opinionated
parts of this post. <strong>I want to underscore that the opinions reflected
here are my own and do not reflect the overall Mercurial Project or even
a consensus within it.</strong></p>
<h2>The Future of Python 3 and Mercurial</h2>
<p>Mercurial's port to Python 3 is still ongoing. While we've shipped
Python 3 support and the test harness is clean on Python 3, I view shipping
as only a milestone - arguably <em>the</em> most important one - in a longer
journey. There's still a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>It is now 2020 and Python 2 support is now officially dead from the
perspective of the Python language maintainers. Linux distributions are
starting to rip out Python 2. Packages are dropping Python 2 support in
new versions. The world is moving to Python 3 only. But <strong>Mercurial still
officially supports Python 2</strong>. And it is still yet to be determined how
long we will retain support for Python 2 in the code base. We've only had
one release supporting Python 3. Our users still need to port their
extensions (implemented in Python). Our users still need to start widely
using Mercurial with Python 3. Even our own developers need to switch to
Python 3 (old habits are hard to break).</p>
<p>I anticipate a long tail of random bugs in Mercurial on Python 3. While
the tests may pass, our code coverage is not 100%. And even if it were,
Python is a dynamic language and there are tons of invariants that aren't
caught at compile time and can only be discovered at run time. <strong>These
invariants cannot all be detected by tests, no matter how good your test
coverage is.</strong> This is a <em>feature</em>/<em>limitation</em> of dynamic languages. Our
users will likely be finding a long tail of miscellaneous bugs on Python
3 for <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>At present, our code base is littered with tons of random hacks to bridge
the gap between Python 2 and 3. Once Python 2 support is dropped, we'll
need to remove these hacks and make the source tree Python 3 native, with
minimal shims to wallpaper over differences in Python 3 versions. <strong>Removing
this Python version bridge code will likely require hundreds of commits and
will be a non-trivial effort.</strong> It's likely to be deemed a low priority (it
is glorified busy work after all), and code for the express purpose of
supporting Python 2 will likely linger for years.</p>
<p>We are also still shoring up our packaging and distribution story on
Python 3. This is easier on some platforms than others. I created
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a> partially because
of the poor experience I had with Python application packaging and
distribution through the Mercurial Project. The Mercurial Project has
already signed off on using PyOxidizer for distributing Mercurial in
the future. So look for an <em>oxidized</em> Mercurial distribution in the
near future! (You could argue PyOxidizer is an epic yak shave to better
support Mercurial. But that's for another post.)</p>
<p>Then there's Windows support. A Python 3 powered Mercurial on Windows
still has a handful of known issues. It may require a few more releases
before we consider Python 3 on Windows to be stable.</p>
<p>Because we're still on a code base that must support Python 2, our
adoption of Python 3 features is very limited. The only Python 3
feature that Mercurial developers seem to almost universally get excited
about is type annotations. We already have some people playing around
with <code>pytype</code> using comment-based annotations and <code>pytype</code> has already
caught a few bugs. We're eager to go all in on type annotations and
uncover lots of dynamic typing bugs and poorly implemented APIs.
Beyond type annotations, I can't name any feature that people are screaming
to adopt and which makes a lot of sense for Mercurial. There's a long
tail of minor features I'm sure will get utilized. But none of the
marquee features that define major language releases seem that interesting
to us. Time will tell.</p>
<h2>Commentary on Python 3</h2>
<p>Having described Mercurial's ongoing journey to Python 3, I now want to
focus more on Python itself. Again, the opinions here are my own and
don't reflect those of the Mercurial Project.</p>
<p><strong>Succinctly, my experience porting Mercurial and other projects to
Python 3 has significantly soured my perceptions of Python. As much as
I have historically loved Python - from the language to the welcoming
community - I am still struggling to understand how Python could manage
to inflict so much hardship on the community by choosing the transition
plan that they did.</strong> I believe Python's choices represent a terrific
example of what not to do when managing a large project or ecosystem.
Maintainers of other largely-deployed systems would benefit from taking
the time to understand and reflect on Python's missteps.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008. And it took the better part of
a decade for the community to embrace it. <strong>This should be universally
recognized as a failure.</strong> While hindsight is 20/20, many of the issues
with Python 3 were obvious at the time and could have been mitigated had
the language maintainers been more accommodating - and dare I say
empathetic - to its users.</p>
<p>Initially, Python 3 had a rather cavalier attitude towards backwards and
forwards compatibility. In the early years of Python 3, the attitude of
Python's maintainers was <em>Python 3 is a new, better language: you should
target it explicitly</em>. There were some tools and methods to ease the
transition. But nothing super polished, especially in the early years.
Adoption of Python 3 in the overall community was slow. Python developers
in the wild justifiably complained that the value proposition of Python 3
was too weak to justify porting effort. Not helping was that the early
advice for targeting Python 3 was to rewrite the source code to become
Python 3 native. This is in contrast with using the same source to run on both
Python 2 and 3. For library and application maintainers, this potentially
meant maintaining separate versions of your code or forcing end-users to
make a giant leap, which would realistically orphan users on an old version,
fragmenting your user base. Neither of those were great alternatives, so
you can understand why many projects didn't bite.</p>
<p>For many projects of non-trivial size, flag day transitions from Python 2 to
3 were simply not viable: the pathway to Python 3 was to make code dual
Python 2/3 compatible and gradually switch over the runtime to Python 3.
But initial versions of Python 3 made this effectively impossible! Let me
give a few specific examples.</p>
<p>In Python 2, a string literal <code>''</code> is effectively an array of bytes. In
Python 3, it is a series of Unicode code points - a fundamentally different
type! In Python 2, you could write <code>b''</code> to be explicit that a string literal
was bytes or you could write <code>u''</code> to indicate a Unicode literal, mimicking
Python 3's behavior. In Python 3, you could write <code>b''</code> to create a <code>bytes</code>
instance. But for whatever reason, Python 3 initially removed the <code>u''</code> syntax,
meaning there wasn't as easy way to explicitly denote the type of each
string literal so that it was consistent between Python 2 and 3! Python 3.3
(released September 2012) restored <code>u''</code> support, making it more viable to
write Python source code that worked on both Python 2 and 3. <strong>For nearly 4
years, Python 3 took away the consistent syntax for denoting bytes/Unicode
string literals.</strong></p>
<p>Another feature was <code>%</code> formatting of strings. Python 2 allowed use of the
<code>%</code> formatting operator on both its string types. But Python 3 initially
removed the implementation of <code>%</code> from <code>bytes</code>. Why, I have no clue. It
is perfectly reasonable to splice byte sequences into a buffer via use of
a formatting string. But the Python language maintainers insisted otherwise.
And it wasn't until the community complained about its absence loudly enough
that this feature was
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-pep-461">restored in Python 3.5</a>,
which was released in September 2015. Fun fact: the lack of this feature was
once considered a blocker for Mercurial moving to Python 3 because
Mercurial uses <code>bytes</code> almost universally, which meant that nearly every use
of <code>%</code> would have to be changed to something else. And to this day, Python
3's <code>bytes</code> still doesn't have a <code>format()</code> method, so the alternative was
effectively string concatenation, which is a massive step backwards from the
expressiveness of <code>%</code> formatting.</p>
<p><strong>The initial approach of Python 3 mirrors a folly that many developers
and projects make: attempting a rewrite instead of performing incremental
evolution.</strong> For established projects, large scale rewrites often go poorly.
And Python 3 is no exception. Yes, from a code level, CPython (and likely
other Python implementations) were incremental changes over Python 2 using
the same code base. But from a language and standard library level, the
differences in Python 3 were significant enough that I - and even Python's
core maintainers - considered it a new language, and therefore a rewrite.
When your random project attempts a rewrite and fails, the blast radius of that is
often contained to that project. Maybe you don't publish a new release
as soon as you otherwise would. <strong>But when you are powering an ecosystem,
the ripple effects from a failed rewrite percolate throughout that ecosystem
and last for years and have many second order effects. We see this with
Python 3, where poor choices made in the late 2000s are inflicting significant
hardship still in 2020.</strong></p>
<p>From the initial restrained adoption of Python 3, it is obvious that the
Python ecosystem overwhelmingly rejected the initial boil the oceans approach
of Python 3. Python's maintainers eventually got the message and started
restoring features like <code>u''</code> and <code>bytes</code> <code>%</code> formatting back into the
language to placate the community. All the while Python 3 had been accumulating
new features and the cumulative sum of those features was compelling enough
to win over users.</p>
<p>For many projects (including Mercurial), Python 3.4/3.5 was the first viable
porting target for Python 3. Python 3.5 was released in September 2015, almost
7 years after Python 3.0 was released in December 2008. <strong>Seven. Years.</strong>
An ecosystem that falters for that long is generally not healthy. What may have
saved Python from total collapse here is that Python 2 was still going strong and
people were generally happy with it. I really do think Python dodged a bullet
here, because there was a massive window where the language could have
hemorrhaged a critical amount of its user base and been relegated to an
afterthought. One could draw an analogy to Perl, which lost out to PHP,
Python, and Ruby, and whose fall from grace aligned with a lengthy
transition from Perl 5 to 6.</p>
<p>If you look back at the early history of Python 3, <strong>I think you are forced
to conclude that Python effectively kneecapped itself for 5-7 years
through questionable implementation choices that prevented users from
incurring incremental transitions between the major language versions. 2008
to 2013-2015 should be known as the <em>lost years of Python</em> because so much
opportunity and energy was squandered.</strong> Yes, Python is still healthy today
and Python 3 is (finally) being adopted at scale. But had earlier versions
of Python 3 been more <em>empathetic</em> towards Python 2 users porting to it,
Python and Python 3 in 2020 would be even stronger than it is. The community
was artificially hindered for years. And we won't know until 2023-2025 what
things could have looked like in 2020 had the Python core language team
spent more time paving a smoother road between the major language versions.</p>
<p>To be clear, I do think Python 3 is generally a better language than Python 2.
It has fewer warts, more compelling features, and better performance (except
for startup time, which is still slower than Python 2). I am ecstatic the
community is finally rallying around Python 3! For my Python coding, it has
reached the point where I curse under my breath when I need to support
Python 2 or even older versions of Python 3, like 3.5 or 3.6: I just wish
the world would move on and adopt the future already!</p>
<p>But I would be remiss if I failed to mention some of my gripes with Python
3 beyond the transition shenanigans.</p>
<p>Perhaps my least favorite <em>feature</em> of Python 3 is its insistence that the
world is Unicode. In Python 2, the default string type was backed by
bytes. In Python 3, the default string type is backed by Unicode code
points. As part of that transition, large parts of the standard library
now operate in the Unicode space instead of the domain of bytes. I understand
why Python does this: they want <em>strings</em> to be Unicode and don't want
users to have to spend that much energy thinking about when to use
<code>str</code> versus <code>bytes</code>. This approach is admirable and somewhat defensible
because it takes a stand on a solution that is arguably <em>good enough</em> for
most users. However, <strong>the approach of assuming the world is Unicode is
flat out wrong and has significant implications for systems level
applications</strong> (like version control tools).</p>
<p>There are a myriad of places in Python's standard library where Python
insists on using the Unicode-backed <code>str</code> type and rejects <code>bytes</code>. For
example, various networking modules refuse to accept <code>bytes</code> for hostnames
or URLs. HTTP libraries won't accept <code>bytes</code> for HTTP header names or values.
Functions that are proxies to POSIX-defined functions won't accept <code>bytes</code>
even though the POSIX function it calls into is using <code>char *</code> and isn't
Unicode aware. Then there's filename handling, where Python assumes the
existence of a global encoding for filenames and uses this encoding to convert
between <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code>. And it does this despite POSIX filesystem paths
being a bag of bytes where the only rules are that <code>\0</code> terminates the
filename and <code>/</code> is special.</p>
<p>In cases like Python refusing to accept <code>bytes</code> for things like HTTP
header names (which will just be spit out over the wire as bytes), Python's
pendulum has swung too far towards Unicode only. In my opinion, Python needs
to be more accommodating and allow <code>bytes</code> when it makes sense. I hope the
pendulum knocks some sense into people when it swings back towards a more
reasonable solution that better acknowledges the realities of the world we
live in.</p>
<p>For areas like filename handling, the world is more complicated. Python
is effectively an abstraction layer over the operating system APIs exposing
this functionality. And there is often an impedance mismatch between operating
systems. For example, POSIX (Linux) tends to use <code>char *</code> for everything
and doesn't care about encoding and Windows tends to use 16 bit character
types where the encoding is... a can of worms.</p>
<p><strong>The reality here is that it is impossible to abstract over differences
between operating system behavior without compromises that can result in data
loss, outright wrong behavior, or loss of functionality. But Python 3 attempts
to do it anyway, making Python 3 unsuitable (or at least highly undesirable) for
certain systems level applications that rely on it</strong> (like a version control
tool).</p>
<p>In fairness to Python, it isn't the only programming language that gets
this wrong. The only language I've seen <em>properly</em> implement higher-order
abstractions on top of operating system facilities is Rust, whose approach can
be generalized as <em>use Python 3's solution of normalizing to Unicode/UTF-8 by
default</em>, but expose <em>escape hatches</em> which allow access to the raw underlying
types and APIs used by the operating system for the advanced consumers who
require it. For example, Rust's <code>Path</code> type which represents a filesystem path
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html#method.as_os_str">allows access</a>
to the raw <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.OsStr.html">OsStr</a> value
used by the operating system, not a normalization of it to bytes or Unicode,
which may be lossy. This allows consumers to e.g. create and retrieve
OS-native filesystem paths without data loss. This functionality is critical
in some domains. Python 3's awareness/insistence that the world is
Unicode (which it isn't universally) reduces Python's applicability in these
domains.</p>
<p>Speaking of Rust, at the Mercurial developer meetup in October 2019, we were
discussing the use of Rust in Mercurial and one of the core maintainers blurted
out something along the lines of <em>if Rust were at its current state 5 years ago,
Mercurial would have likely ported from Python 2 to Rust instead of Python 3</em>.
As crazy as it initially sounded, I think I agree with that assessment. With the
benefit of hindsight, having been a key player in the Python 3 porting effort,
seeing all the complications and headaches Python 3 is introducing, and
having learned Rust and witnessed its benefits for performance, control,
and correctness firsthand, porting to Rust would likely have been the correct
move for the project at that point in time. 2020 is not 2014, however, and I'm
not sure if I would opt for a rewrite in Rust today. (Most rewrites are follies
after all.) But I know one thing: I certainly wouldn't implement a new version
control tool in Python 3 and I would probably choose Rust as an implementation
language for most new projects in the systems level space or with an expected
shelf life of 10+ years. (I really should blog about how awesome Rust is.)</p>
<p>Back to the topic of Python itself, <strong>I'm really soured on Python at this
point in time. The effort required to port to Python 3 was staggering. For
Mercurial, Python 3 introduces a ton of problems and doesn't really solve
many. We effectively sludged through mud for several years only to wind
up in a state that feels strictly worse than where we started. I'm sure it will
be strictly better in a few years. But at that point, we're talking about a
5+ year transition. To call the Python 3 transition disruptive and
distracting for the project would be an understatement. As a project maintainer,
it's natural to ask what we could have accomplished if we weren't forced
to carry out this sideshow.</strong></p>
<p>I can't shake the feeling that a lot of the pain afflicted by the Python 3
transition could have been avoided had Python's language leadership made
a different set of decisions and more highly prioritized the transition
experience. (Like not initially removing features like <code>u''</code> and <code>bytes %</code>
and not introducing gratuitous backwards compatibility breaks, like with
<code>items()/iteritems()</code>. I would have also liked to see a feature like
<code>from __future__</code> - maybe <code>from __past__</code> - that would make it easier for
Python 3 code to target semantics in earlier versions in order to provide
a more turnkey on-ramp onto new versions.) I simultaneously see Python 3
losing its position as a justifiable tool in some domains (like systems
level tooling) due to ongoing design decisions and poor implementation (like
startup overhead problems). (In contrast, I see Rust excelling where Python
is faltering and find Rust code surprisingly expressive to write and maintain
given how low-level it is and therefore feel that Rust is a compelling
alternative to Python in a surprisingly large number of domains.)</p>
<p>Look, I know it is easy for me to armchair quarterback and critique with the
benefit of hindsight/ignorance. I'm sure there is a lot of nuance here. I'm
sure there was disagreement within the Python community over a lot of these
issues. Maintaining a large and successful programming language and community
like Python's is hard and you aren't going to please all the people all the
time. And speaking as a maintainer, I have mad respect for the people leading
such a large community. But niceties aside, everyone knows the Python 3
transition was rough and could have gone better. It should not have taken 11
years to get to where we are today.</p>
<p><strong>I'd like to encourage the Python Project to conduct a thorough postmortem on
the transition to Python 3.</strong> Identify what went well, what could have gone
better, and what should be done next time such a large language change is wanted.
Speaking as a Python user, a maintainer of a Python project, and as someone in
industry who is now skeptical about use of Python at work due to risks of
potentially company crippling high-effort migrations in the future, a postmortem
would help restore my confidence that Python's maintainers learned from the
various missteps on the road to Python 3 and these potentially ecosystem
crippling mistakes won't be made again.</p>
<p>Python had a wildly successful past few decades. And it can continue to
thrive for several more. But the Python 3 migration was painful for all
involved. And as much as we need to move on and leave Python 2 behind us,
there are some important lessons to be learned. I hope the Python community
takes the opportunity to reflect and am confident it will grow stronger by
taking the time to do so.</p>

<a href='/blog/category/python'>Python</a>, <a href='/blog/category/pyoxidizer'>PyOxidizer</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The <a href="/blog/2019/06/24/building-standalone-python-applications-with-pyoxidizer/">initial release</a>
of PyOxidizer generated a bit of excitement across the Internet! The post was
commented on heavily in various forums and my phone was constantly buzzing from
all the Twitter activity. There has been a steady stream of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">GitHub Issues</a> for the project,
which I consider a good sign. So thank you everybody for the support and
encouragement! And especially thank you to everyone who filed an issue or
submitted a pull request!</p>
<p>While I don't usually read the comments, I was looking at various forums
posting about PyOxidizer to see what reactions were like. A common negative
theme was the lack of C extension support in PyOxidizer. People seemed
dismissive of PyOxidizer because it didn't support C extensions. Despite the
documentation stating that the feature was planned and that I had an idea for
how to implement it, people seemed pessimistic. Perhaps I didn't adequately
communicate that making C extensions work is actually a subset of the
already-solved <em>single file executable</em> problem and therefore was already
a <em>solved problem</em> at the technical level (only the integration with the
Python and PyOxidizer <em>build systems</em> was missing). So in my mind C
extension support was only a matter of time and the only open question was
how many hacks would be needed to make it work, not <em>whether</em> it would work.</p>
<p>Well, I'm pleased to report that <strong>the just-released version 0.2 of PyOxidizer
supports C extensions on Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>. If you install a Python
package through a <code>pip-install-simple</code>, <code>pip-requirements-file</code>, or
<code>setup-py-install</code> packaging rule, C extensions will be compiled in a special
way that enables them to be embedded in the same binary containing Python
itself. I've tested it with the <code>zope.interface</code>, <code>zstandard</code>, and
<code>mercurial</code> packages and it seems to work (although Mercurial has other
issues that prevent it from being packaged as a PyOxidizer application - but
the C extensions do compile).</p>
<p>There are some
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html#native-extension-modules">limitations</a>
to the support, however. I'm pretty confident the limitations can be eliminated
given enough time. Given how many people were hung up on the lack of C extensions
and were seemingly writing off PyOxidizer thinking it was snake oil or something,
I wanted to deliver basic C extension support to curtail this line of criticism.
Perfect is the enemy of good and hopefully basic C extension support is good
enough to ease concerns about PyOxidizer's viability.</p>
<p>Also in PyOxidizer 0.2 are some minor new features, like the <code>--pip-install</code> and
<code>--python-code</code> flags to <code>pyoxidizer init</code>. These allow you to generate a
<code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file pre-configured to install some packages from pip and run
custom Python code. So now applications can be created and built with a one-liner
without having to edit a <code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file!</p>
<p>The full release notes <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html">are available</a>.
As always, please keep

interested in hearing about packages whose C extensions don't work properly.</p>

  <p>Python application distribution is generally considered an unsolved
problem. At their PyCon 2019 keynote talk, Russel Keith-Magee
<a href="https://youtu.be/ftP5BQh1-YM?t=2033">identified code distribution</a> as
a potential <em>black swan</em> - an existential threat for longevity - for
Python. In their words, <em>Python hasn't ever had a consistent story for
how I give my code to someone else, especially if that someone else
isn't a developer and just wants to use my application.</em> I completely
agree. And I want to add my opinion that unless your target user is a
Python developer, they shouldn't need to know anything about Python
packaging, Python itself, or even the existence of Python in order to
use your application. (And you can replace <em>Python</em> in the previous
sentence with any programming language or software technology: most
end-users don't care about the technical implementation, they just
want to get stuff done.)</p>
<p>Today, I'm excited to announce the first release of PyOxidizer
(<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">project</a>,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>), an open
source utility that aims to solve the Python application distribution
problem! (The installation instructions are in the docs.)</p>
<h2>Standalone Single File, No Dependencies Executable Python Applications</h2>
<p><strong>PyOxidizer's marquee feature is that it can produce a single file
executable containing a fully-featured Python interpreter, its
extensions, standard library, and your application's modules and
resources.</strong> In other words, you can have a single <code>.exe</code> providing
your application. And unlike other tools in this space which tend to
be operating system specific, PyOxidizer works across platforms
(currently Windows, macOS, and Linux - the most popular platforms for
Python today). Executables built with PyOxidizer have minimal
dependencies on the host environment nor do they do anything
complicated at run-time. I believe PyOxidizer is the only open
source tool to have all these attributes.</p>
<p><strong>On Linux, it is possible to build a fully statically linked executable.</strong>
You can drop this executable into a chroot or container where it is the
only file and it will <em>just work</em>. On macOS and Windows, the only
library dependencies are on always-present or extremely common
libraries. More details are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributing.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>At execution time, binaries built with PyOxidizer do not do anything
special to run the Python interpreter. (Other tools in this space do
things like create a temporary directory or SquashFS filesystem and
extract Python to it.) <strong>PyOxidizer loads everything from memory and there
is no explicit I/O being performed. When you <code>import</code> a Python module,
the bytecode for that module is being loaded from a memory address in
the executable using zero-copy.</strong> This makes PyOxidizer executables
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#faster-python-programs">faster</a>
to start and <code>import</code> - faster than a <code>python</code> executable itself!</p>
<h2>Current Release and Future Roadmap</h2>
<p>Today's release of PyOxidizer is just the first release milestone in
what I envision is a long and successful project history. While my
over-arching goal with PyOxidizer is to <em>solve</em> vast swaths of the
Python application distribution problem, I want to be clear that this
first release comes nowhere close to doing so. I toiled with what
features <em>must</em> be in the initial release. I ultimately decided that
PyOxidizer's current functionality is extremely valuable to <em>some</em>
audiences and that the project has matured to the point where more
eyeballs and users would substantially help its development. (I could
definitely use some help prioritizing which features to work on and
for that I need users and user feedback.)</p>
<p>In today's release, PyOxidizer is good at producing executables
embedding Python. It doesn't yet venture too far into the <em>distribution</em>
part of the problem (I want it to be trivial to produce MSI installers,
DMG images, deb/rpm packages, etc). But on Linux, this is already a huge
step forward because PyOxidizer makes it easy (hopefully!) to produce
binaries that should <em>just work</em> on other machines. (Anyone who has
attempted to distribute Linux applications will tell you how painful this
problem can be.)</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, I believe today's release of PyOxidizer to
be a viable tool for some applications. And I believe PyOxidizer can
start to replace existing tools in this space. (See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparisons.html">Comparisons to Other Tools</a>
document for how PyOxidizer compares to other Python packaging and
distribution tools.)</p>
<p>Using today's release of PyOxidizer, larger user-facing applications
using Python (like Dropbox, <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>,
<a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a>, etc) could use
PyOxidizer to produce self-contained executables. This would likely cut
down on installer size, decrease install/update time (fewer files means
faster operations), and hopefully make packaging simpler for application
maintainers. Maintainers of Python utilities could produce self-contained
executables, making their utilities faster to start and easier to
package and distribute.</p>
<h2>New Possibilities and Reliability for Python</h2>
<p>By enabling support for self-contained, single file Python applications,
PyOxidizer opens exciting new doors for Python. Because Python has
historically required an explicit, separate runtime not part of the
executable, Python was not viable (or was a hinderance) in many domains.
For example, if you wanted to use Python to <em>bootstrap</em> a fresh server
or empty container environment, you had a chicken-and-egg problem because
you needed to install Python before you could use it.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> for example. One of Ansible's
features is that it remotes into a machine and runs things. The way
it does this is it dynamically generates Python scripts locally, uploads
them to the remote machine, and tells the remote to execute them. Those
Python scripts require the existence of a Python interpreter on the
remote machine. This means you need to install Python on a machine before
you can control it with Ansible. Furthermore, because the remote's Python
isn't under Ansible's control, you can assume very little about its behavior
and capabilities, making interaction a bit brittle.</p>
<p>Using PyOxidizer, projects like Ansible could produce a self-contained
executable containing a Python interpreter. They could transfer that
single binary to the remote machine and execute it, instantly giving the
remote machine access to a fully-featured and modern Python interpreter.
From there, the sky is the limit. In Ansible's case, the executable could
contain the full Ansible runtime, along with any 3rd party Python
packages they wanted to leverage. This would allow execution to occur
(possibly mostly independently) on the remote machine. This architecture
is simpler, scales better, would likely result in faster operations, and
would probably improve the quality of life for everyone involved, from
application developers to its end users.</p>
<p><strong>Self-contained Python applications built with PyOxidizer essentially
solve the <em>Python interpreter bootstrapping and reliability</em> problems.</strong>
By providing a Python interpreter and a known set of Python modules, you
provide a highly deterministic and reliable execution environment for your
application. You don't need to fret about which version of Python
is installed: you <em>know</em> which version of Python you are using.
You don't need to worry about which Python packages are installed:
you control explicitly which packages are available. You don't need to
worry about whether you are running in a virtualenv, what <code>sys.path</code>
is set to, whether <code>.pth</code> files come into play, whether various
<code>PYTHON*</code> environment variables can mess up your application, whether
some Linux distribution packaged Python differently, what to put in your
script's <em>shebang</em>, etc: executables built with PyOxidizer behave as
you have instructed them to because they are <em>compiled</em> that way.</p>
<p>All of the concerns in the previous paragraph contribute to a larger
problem in the eyes of application maintainers that can be summarized as
<em>Python isn't reliable</em>. And because <em>Python isn't reliable</em>, many
people reach the conclusion that <em>Python shouldn't be used</em> (this is the
<em>black swan</em> that was referred to earlier). With PyOxidizer, the Python
environment is isolated and highly deterministic making the
reliability problem largely go away. This makes Python a more viable
technology choice. And it enables application maintainers to aggressively
adopt modern Python versions, utilize third party packages fearlessly,
and spend far less time chasing an extremely long tail of issues related
to Python environment variance. Succinctly, application developers can
focus on building great applications instead of toiling with Python
environment problems.</p>
<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer is still in its relative infancy. While it is far from
feature complete, I'm mentally committed to working on the remaining
major functionality. The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html">Status</a>
document lists major missing functionality, lesser missing functionality,
and potential future value-add functionality.</p>
<p>I want PyOxidizer to provide a Python application packaging and
distribution experience that <em>just works</em> with minimal cognitive effort
from Python application maintainers. I have spent a lot of effort
documenting PyOxidizer. I care passionately about user experience and want
everything about PyOxidizer to be simple and frustration free. I
know things aren't there yet. The problems that PyOxidizer is attempting
to solve are hard (that's a reason nobody has solved them well yet). I
know there's details floating around in my head that haven't been
added to the documentation yet. I know there's missing features and
bugs in PyOxidizer. I know there are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_pitfalls.html">Packaging Pitfalls</a>
yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to make PyOxidizer great.</strong> I encourage Python
application maintainers reading this to head over to
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
and the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging.html">Packaging User Guide</a>
and try to package your applications with PyOxidizer. If things don't
work, let me know by <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing an issue</a>.
If you are confused by lack of or unclear documentation, file an issue.
If something frustrates you, file an issue. If you want to suggest I
work on a certain feature or fix a bug, file an issue! Tweet to
<a href="https://twitter.com/indygreg">@indygreg</a> to engage with me there. Join
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyoxidizer-users">pyoxidizer-users mailing list</a>.
While I feel PyOxidizer is usable today (that's why I'm announcing it),
<strong>I need your feedback to help guide future prioritization.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I know PyOxidizer has significant implications for some
companies and projects that use Python. While I'm not looking to
enrich myself or make my livelihood from PyOxidizer, if PyOxidizer is
useful to you and you'd like to send money my way as appreciation, you
can do so <a href="https://www.patreon.com/indygreg">on Patreon</a> or
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=gregory%2eszorc%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=PyOxidizer&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted">PayPal</a>.
If not, that's totally fine: I wouldn't be making PyOxidizer open source
if I didn't want to share it with the world for free! And I am
financially well off as well. I just feel like there should be
more financial contribution to open source because it would improve
the health of the ecosystem and I can help achieve that end by
advocating for it and giving myself.</p>
<h2>Leveraging Rust</h2>
<p>The <em>oxidize</em> part of PyOxidizer comes from Rust (See the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust">Wikipedia Rust article</a> - for the
chemical not the programming language - to understand where <em>oxidize</em>
comes from.) The build time packaging and building functionality is
implemented in Rust. And the binary that embeds and controls the
Python interpreter in built applications is Rust code. Rationale for
these decisions is
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-rust">explained in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first non-toy project using Rust and I have to say that
Rust is... incredible! I may have to author a dedicated blog post
extolling the virtues of Rust. In short, Rust is now my go-to language
for systems level projects. Unless you need the target platform
versatility, I don't think C or C++ are defensibles choices in 2019 given
their security deficiencies. Languages like Go, Java, and various JVM
or CLR languages are acceptable if you can tolerate having a garbage
collector and/or a larger runtime. But what makes Rust superior in my
mind is the ability for the compiler to prevent large classes of
software bugs (especially those that turn into CVEs) and inefficiencies that
have plagued our industry for decades. <strong>Rust is the first programming
language I've used where I feel like the language itself, the compiler,
the tools around it (cargo, rustfmt, clippy, rustup, etc), and the
community surrounding it all actually care about and assist me with
writing high quality software. Nothing else I've used comes even close.</strong></p>
<p>What I've been most surprised about Rust is how high level it feels
for a systems level language that isn't garbage collected. When you
program lower-level languages like C or C++, compared to a higher level
language like Python, you have to type a lot more and be more explicit
in nearly everything you do. While Rust is certainly not as expressive
or compact as say Python, it is far, far closer to Python than I was
expecting it to be. Yes, you do have to type more and think more about
your code to appease the Rust compiler's constraints. But the return
on that investment is the compiler preventing entire classes of bugs
and C/C++ levels of performance. When I started PyOxidizer, the build
time logic was implemented in Python and only the run-time pieces were
in Rust. <strong>After learning a bit more Rust and realizing the obvious
code quality benefits, I ditched Python and adopted Rust for the build
time logic.</strong> And as the code base has grown and gone through various
refactorings, I am so glad I did so! The Rust compiler has caught
dozens of would-be bugs in Python. Granted, many of these can be
attributed to having strong typing and compile time type checking and
Rust is little different than say Java on this front. But a significant
number of prevented bugs covered invariants in the code because of the
way Rust's type system often intersects with control flow. e.g. <code>match</code>
arms must be exhaustive, so you can't have unhandled values/types and
unchecked <code>Result</code> instances result ina compiler warning. And clippy
has been just fantastic helping to guide me towards writing more
<em>acceptable</em> code following community accepted best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Even though PyOxidizer is implemented in Rust, most end-users shouldn't
have to care</strong> (beyond having to install a Rust compiler and build
PyOxidizer from source). The existence of Rust should be abstracted
away from Python packagers. I did this on purpose because I believe that
users of an application shouldn't have to care about the technical
implementation of that application. It is a bit unfortunate that I
force users to install Rust before using PyOxidizer, but in my defense
the target audience is technically savvy developers, bootstrapping Rust
is easy, and PyOxidizer is young, so I think it is acceptble for now.
If people get hung up on it, I can provide pre-compiled <code>pyoxidizer</code>
executables.</p>
<p>But if you do know Rust, PyOxidizer being implemented in Rust opens
up some exciting possibilities!</p>
<p><strong>One exciting possibility with PyOxidizer is the ability to add Rust
code to your Python application.</strong> PyOxidizer works by generating a
default Rust application (<code>main.rs</code>) that simply instantiates and runs
an embedded Python interpreter then exits. It essentially does what
<code>python</code> or a Python script would do. The key takeaway here is your
<em>Python application</em> is technically a <em>Rust application</em> (in the same
way that <code>python</code> is technically a <em>C application</em>). And being a
Rust application means you can add Rust code to that application. You
can modify the autogenerated <code>main.rs</code> to do things before, during, and
after the embedded Python interpreter runs. It's a regular Rust program
and can do anything that Rust programs can do!</p>
<p>Another possibility - and variant of above - is embedding Python
in existing Rust projects. PyOxidizer's mechanism for embedding a
Python interpreter is implemented as a standalone Rust crate. <strong>One
can add the pyembed crate to an existing Rust project and a little of
build system magic later, your Rust project can now embed and run
a Python interpreter!</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of potential for hybrid Rust + Python programs. And
I am <strong>very</strong> excited about the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a Rust programmer, PyOxidizer allows you to easily embed
Python in your Rust application. If you are a Python programmer,
PyOxidizer allows your to easily leverage Rust in your Python
application.</strong> In short, the package ecosystem of the other becomes
available to you. And if you aren't familiar with Rust, there are some
potentially crazy possibilities. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is a GPU accelerated
terminal emulator written in Rust and
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> is an entire web browser
engine written in Rust. With PyOxidizer, you could integrate a
terminal emulator or browser engine as part of your Python
application if you really wanted to. And, yes, Rust's packaging
tools are so good that stuff like this tends to <em>just work</em>. As
a concrete example, the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool contains <code>libgit2</code>
for performing in-process interactions with Git repositories. Adding
this required a single line change to a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and it
<em>just worked</em> on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Stuff like this often
takes hours to days to integrate in C/C++. It is quite ridiculous
how easy it is to add (complex) components to Rust projects!</p>
<p>For years, Python projects have implemented extensions in C to
realize performance wins. If your Python application is a Rust
executable, then implementing this functionality in Rust (rather
than C) seems rationale. So we may see <em>oxidized</em> Python
applications have their performance critical pieces slowly be
rewritten in Rust. (Honestly, the Rust crates to interface between
Rust and the CPython API still leave a bit to be desired, so the
experience of writing this Rust code still isn't great. But things
will certainly improve over time.)</p>
<p>This type of <em>inside-out</em> split language work has been practiced
in Python for years. What PyOxidizer brings to the table is the
ability to more easily port code <em>outside-in</em>. For example, you
could implement performance-criticial, early application logic such
as config file parsing and command line argument parsing in Rust.
You could then have Rust service some application functionality
without Python. Why would you want this? Performance is a valid
reason. Starting a Python interpreter, importing modules, and running
code can consume several dozen or even hundreds of milliseconds. If
you are writing performance sensitive applications, the existence
of <em>any</em> Python can add enough latency that people no longer perceive
the interaction as instananeous. This added latency can make Python
totally inappropriate for some contexts, such as for programs that run
as part of populating your shell's prompt. Writing such code in Rust
instead of Python dramatically increases the probability that the
code is fast and likely delivers stronger correctness guarantees
courtesy of Rust's compile time validation as well!</p>
<p>An extreme practice of <em>outside-in</em> porting of Python to Rust would
be to incrementally rewrite an entire Python application in Rust.
Rust's ergonomics are exceptional and I do think we'll see people
choose Rust where they previously would have chosen Python. I've
done this myself with PyOxidizer and feel it is a very defensible
decision to reach! I feel a bit conflicted releasing a tool which
may undermine Python's popularity by encouraging use of Rust over
Python. But at the end of the day, PyOxidizer increases the utility
of both Python and Rust by giving each more readily accessible
access to the other and PyOxidizer improves the overall utility of
Python by improving the application distribution story. I have no
doubt PyOxidizer is a net benefit for the Python ecosystem, even if
it does help usher in more people choosing Rust over Python. If
I have an ulterior motive in developing PyOxidizer, it is to enable
Mercurial's official distribution to be a Rust executable and
for some functionality (like <code>hg status</code>) to be runnable without
Python (for performance reasons).</p>
<p>Another possible use of PyOxidizer is as a library. All the build time
functionality of PyOxidizer exists in a Rust crate. So, you can add
the <code>pyoxidizer</code> crate to your own Rust project and use its code to
do things like build a library containing Python, compile Python
source modules to bytecode, or walk a directory tree and find Python
resources within. The code is still heavily geared towards PyOxidizer
and there's no promise of API stability. But this potential for library
usage exists and if others want to experiment with building custom
Python binaries not using the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool, using PyOxidizer
as a library might save you a lot of time.</p>
<h2>Standalone Python Distributions</h2>
<p>One of the most time consuming parts of building PyOxidizer was
figuring out how to build self-contained Python distributions.
Typically, a Python build consists of a library, shared libraries for
various extension modules, shared libraries required by the prior
items, and a hodgepodge of other files, such as .py files implementing
the Python standard library. The
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
project was created to automate creating special builds of Python
which are self-contained and distributable. This requires doing
dirty things with build systems. But I don't want to inflict the
details on you here. What I do think is worth mentioning is how
those Python distributions are distributed. The output of the
build is a tarball containing the Python installation, build artifacts
that can be used to link a custom libpython, and a <code>PYTHON.json</code>
file describing the contents of the distribution. PyOxidizer reads
the <code>PYTHON.json</code> file and learns how it should interact with that
distribution. <strong>If you produce a Python distribution conforming to the
format that <code>python-build-standalone</code> defines, you can use that
Python with PyOxidizer.</strong></p>
<p>While I have no urgency to do so at this time, I could see a future
where this Python distribution format is standardized. Then maintainers
of various Python distributions (CPython, PyPy, etc) would independently
produce their own distributable artifacts conforming to this standard,
in turn allowing machine consumers of Python distributions (such as
PyOxidizer) to easily consume different Python distributions and do
interesting things with them. You could even imagine these Python
distribution archives being readily available as packages in your
system's package manager and their locations exposed via the
<code>sysconfig</code> Python module, making it easy for tools (like PyOxidizer)
to find and use them.</p>
<p>Over time, I could see PyOxidizer's functionality rolling up into
official packaging tools like <code>pip</code>, which would know how to consume
the distribution archives and produce an executable containing a
Python interpreter, required Python modules, etc.</p>
<p>Getting PyOxidizer's functionality rolled into official Python
packaging tools is likely years away (if it ever happens). But I think
standardizing a format describing a Python distribution and (optionally)
contains build artifacts that can be used to <em>repackage</em> it is a
prerequisite and would be a good place to start this journey. I would
certainly love for Python distributions (like CPython) to be in charge of
producing official <em>repackagable</em> distributions because this is not
something I want to be in the business of doing long term (I'm
lazy, less equipped to make the correct decisions, and there are
various trust and security concerns). And while I'm here, I am
definitely interested in upstreaming some of the
<code>python-build-standalone</code> functionality into the existing CPython
build system because coercing CPython's build system to produce
distributable binaries is currently a major pain and I'd love to enable
others to do this. I just haven't had time nor do I know if the patches
would be well received. If a CPython maintainer wants to get in
touch, I'd love to have a conversation!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started hacking on PyOxidizer in November 2018. After months
of chipping away at it, I think I finally have a useful utility
for some audiences. There's still a lot of missing features and
some rough edges. But the core functionality is there and I'm
convinced that PyOxidizer or its underlying technology could be
an integral part of solving Python's application distribution
<em>black swan</em> problem. I'm particularly proud of the hacks I
concocted to coerce Python into importing module bytecode from
memory using zero-copy. Those are documented in
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">this blog post</a>
and in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/master/pyoxidizer/src/pyembed/lib.rs">pyembed crate docs</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation</a>,
install PyOxidizer, and let me know how it goes by

<p>I hope you enjoy <em>oxidizing</em> your Python applications!</p>

  <small>January 10, 2019 at 03:00 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/python'>Python</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've used Python more than any other programming language in the past
4-5 years. Python is the lingua franca for Firefox's build, test, and
CI tooling. Mercurial is written in mostly Python. Many of my
side-projects are in Python.</p>
<p>Along the way, I've accrued a bit of knowledge about Python
performance and how to optimize Python. This post is about sharing
that knowledge with the larger community.</p>
<p>My experience with Python is mostly with the CPython interpreter,
specifically CPython 2.7. Not all observations apply to all Python
distributions or have the same characteristics across Python versions.
I'll try to call this out when relevant. And this post is in no
way a thorough survey of the Python performance landscape. I mainly
want to highlight areas that have particularly plagued me.</p>
<h2>Startup and Module Importing Overhead</h2>
<p>Starting a Python interpreter and importing Python modules is
relatively slow if you care about milliseconds.</p>
<p>If you need to start hundreds or thousands of Python processes
as part of a workload, this overhead will amount to several seconds
of overhead.</p>
<p>If you use Python to provide CLI tools, the overhead can cause
enough lag to be noticeable by people. If you want <em>instantaneous</em>
CLI tools, launching a Python interpreter on every invocation will
make it very difficult to achieve that with a sufficiently complex
tool.</p>
<p>I've written about this problem extensively. My
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-May/134528.html">2014 post on python-dev</a>
outlines the problem. Posts in
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-May/153296.html">May 2018</a>
and <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">October 2018</a>
restate and refine it.</p>
<p>There's not much you can do to alleviate interpreter startup overhead:
fixing this mostly resides with the maintainers of the Python
interpreter because they control the code that is taking precious
milliseconds to complete. About the best you can do is
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id3">disable the site import</a>
in your shebangs and invocations to avoid some extra Python code
running at startup. However, many applications rely on functionality
provided by <code>site.py</code>, so use at your own risk.</p>
<p>Related to this is the problem of module importing. What good is a
Python interpreter if it doesn't have code to run! And the way code
is made available to the interpreter is often through importing
modules.</p>
<p>There are multiple steps to importing modules. And there are sources
of overhead in each one.</p>
<p>There is overhead in finding modules and reading their data. As
I've <a href="/blog/2019/01/06/pyoxidizer-support-for-windows/">demonstrated with PyOxidizer</a>,
replacing the default <em>find and load a module from the filesystem</em>
with an architecturally simpler solution of <em>read the module data
from an in-memory data structure</em> makes importing the Python standard
library take 70-80% of its original time! Having a single module
per filesystem file introduces filesystem overhead and can slow
down Python applications in the critical first milliseconds of
execution. Solutions like PyOxidizer can mitigate this. And hopefully
the Python community sees the overhead in the current approach
and considers moving towards module distribution mechanisms that
don't rely so much on separate files per module.</p>
<p>Another source of module importing overhead is executing code in
that module at import time. Some modules have code in the module
scope outside of functions and classes that runs when the module
is imported. This code execution can add overhead to importing. A
mitigation for this is to not run as much code at import time: only
run code as needed. Python 3.7 supports a module <code>__getattr__</code>
that will be called when a module attribute is not found. This can
be used to lazily populate module attributes on first access.</p>
<p>Another workaround for module importing slowness is lazy module
importing. Instead of actually loading a module when it is imported,
you register a custom module importer that returns a <em>stub</em> for
that module instead. When that stub is first accessed, it will
load the actual module and mutate itself to be that module.</p>
<p>By avoiding the filesystem and module running overhead for unused
modules (modules are typically imported globally and then only
used by certain functions in a module), you can easily shave
dozens of milliseconds from applications importing several dozens
of modules.</p>
<p>But lazy module importers are a bit fragile. Lots of modules
have a pattern where they <code>try: import foo; except ImportError:</code>.
A lazy module importer may never raise <code>ImportError</code> here because
to do so, it would need to search the filesystem for a module
to know if it exists and searching the filesystem would add overhead,
so they don't do it! You work around this by accessing an attribute
on the imported module. This forces the <code>ImportError</code> to be raised
if the module doesn't exist but undermines the laziness of the module
import! This problem is quite nasty. Mercurial's lazy module
importer has to maintain a list of modules that are known to not
be lazy importable to work around it. Another issue is the
<code>from foo import x, y</code> syntax, which also undermines lazy module
importing in cases where <code>foo</code> is a module (as opposed to a package)
because in order to return a reference to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the module
has to be imported.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer, having a fixed set of modules <em>frozen</em> into the binary,
can be efficient about raising <code>ImportError</code>. And Python 3.7's
module <code>__getattr__</code> provides additional flexibility for lazy
module importers. I hope to integrate a robust lazy module importer
into <code>PyOxidizer</code> so these gains are realized automatically.</p>
<p>The best solution to avoiding the interpreter startup and module
import overhead problem is to run a persistent Python process.
If you run Python in a daemon process (say for a web server), you
pretty much get this for free. Mercurial's solution to this is to
run a persistent Python process in the background which exposes a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer">command server</a>
protocol. <code>hg</code> is aliased to a C (or now Rust) executable
which connects to that persistent process and dispatches a
command. The command server approach is a lot of work and can
be a bit fragile and has security concerns. I'm exploring the
idea of shipping a command server with <code>PyOxidizer</code> so
executable can easily gain its benefits and the cost to solving
the problem only needs to be paid in one central place: the
<code>PyOxidizer</code> project.</p>
<h2>Function Call Overhead</h2>
<p>Function calls in Python are relatively slow. (This observation
applies less to PyPy, which can JIT code execution.)</p>
<p>I've seen literally dozens of patches to Mercurial where we inline
code or combine Python functions in order to avoid function
call overhead. In the current development cycle, some effort was
made to reduce the number of functions called when updating
progress bars. (We try to use progress bars for any operation
that could take a while so users know what is going on.) The
old progress bar update code would dispatch to a handful of
functions.
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/6603de284b0a">Caching function call results</a>
and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/963462786f6e">avoiding simple lookups via functions</a>
shaves dozens to hundreds of milliseconds off execution when we're
talking about 1 million executions.</p>
<p>If you have tight loops or recursive functions in Python where
hundreds of thousands or more function calls could be in play, you
need to be aware of the overhead of calling an individual function,
as it can add up quickly! Consider in-lining simple functions
and combining functions to avoid the overhead.</p>
<h2>Attribute Lookup Overhead</h2>
<p>This problem is similar to function call overhead because it
can actually be the same problem!</p>
<p>Resolving an attribute in Python can be relatively slow. (Again,
this observation applies less to PyPy.)</p>
<p>Again, working around this issue is something we do a lot in
Mercurial.</p>
<p>Say you have the following code:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Ignoring that there are better ways to write this example
(<code>total = sum(obj.member)</code> should work), as written, the loop
here will need to resolve <code>obj.member</code> on every iteration.
Python has a relatively complex mechanism for
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">resolving attributes</a>.
For simple types, it can be quite fast. But for complex types,
that attribute access can silently be invoking <code>__getattr__</code>,
<code>__getattribute__</code>, various other <em>dunder</em> methods, and even
custom <code>@property</code> functions. What looks like it should be
a fast attribute lookup can silently be several function calls,
leading to function call overhead! And this overhead can compound
if you are doing things like <code>obj.member1.member2.member3</code> etc.</p>
<p>Each attribute lookup adds overhead. And since nearly everything
in Python is a dictionary, it is somewhat accurate to equate
each attribute lookup as a dictionary lookup. And we know from
basic data structures that dictionary lookups are intrinsically not
as fast as having say a pointer. Yes, there are some tricks in
CPython to avoid the dictionary lookup overhead. But the general
theme I want to get across is that each attribute lookup is a
potential performance sink.</p>
<p>For tight loops - especially those over potentially hundreds of
thousands of iterations - you can avoid this measurable attribute
lookup overhead by aliasing the value to a local. We would write the
example above as:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="n">member</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">member</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">member</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">member</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, this is only safe when the aliased item isn't
replaced inside the loop! If that happens, your iterator will
hold a reference to the old item and things may blow up.</p>
<p>The same trick can be used when calling a method of an object.
Instead of:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Do the following:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyObject</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">process</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000</span><span class="p">:)</span>
    <span class="n">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's also worth noting that in cases where the attribute lookup
is used to call a method (such as the previous example),
Python 3.7 is
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue26110">significantly faster</a>
than previous releases. But I'm pretty sure this is due to
dispatch overhead to the method function itself, not attribute
lookup overhead. So things will be faster yet by avoiding the
attribute lookup.</p>
<p>Finally, unless attribute lookup is calling functions to
resolve the attribute, attribute lookup is generally less of
a problem than function call overhead. And it generally requires
eliminating a lot of attribute lookups for you to notice a
meaningful improvement. That being said, once you add up all
attribute accesses inside a loop, you may be talking about
10 or 20 attributes in the loop alone - before function calls.
And loops with only thousands or low tens of thousands of iterations
can quickly provide hundreds of thousands or millions of attribute
lookups. So be on the lookout!</p>
<h2>Object Overhead</h2>
<p>From the perspective of the Python interpreter, every value is
an object. In CPython, each value is a <code>PyObject</code> struct. Each
object managed by the interpreter is on the heap and needs to have
its own memory holding its reference count, its type, and other
state. Every object is garbage collected. This means that each
new object introduces overhead for the reference counting / garbage
collection mechanism to process. (Again, PyPy can avoid some of
this overhead by being more intelligent about the <em>lifetimes</em> of
short-lived values.)</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the more unique Python values/objects
you create, the slower things are.</p>
<p>For example, say you are iterating over a collection of 1 million
objects. You call a function to process that object into a tuple:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">my_collection</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>process()</code> returns an <code>8-tuple</code>. It doesn't
matter of we destructure the return value or not: this tuple requires
the creation of at least 9 Python values: 1 for the tuple itself
and 8 for its inner members. OK, in reality there could be fewer
values if <code>process()</code> returns a reference to an existing value.
Or there could be more if the types aren't simple types and require
multiple <code>PyObject</code> to represent. My point is that under the hood
the interpreter is having to juggle multiple objects to represent
things.</p>
<p>From my experience, this overhead is only relevant for operations
that benefit from speedups when implemented in a native language
like C or Rust. The reason is the CPython interpreter is just
unable to execute bytecode fast enough for object overhead itself
to matter. Instead, you will likely hit performance issues with
function call overhead, processing overhead, etc long before
object overhead. But there are some exceptions to this, such as
constructing tuples or dicts with several members.</p>
<p>As a concrete example of this overhead, Mercurial has C code for
parsing some of the lower-level data structures. In terms of
raw parsing speed, the C code runs on an order of two magnitudes
faster than CPython. But once we have that C code create
<code>PyObject</code> to present the result, the speedup drops to just a
few times faster, if that. In other words, the overhead is coming
from creating and managing Python values so they can be used
by Python code.</p>
<p>A workaround for this is to produce fewer Python values. If you
only need to access a single value, have a function return that
single value instead of say a tuple or dict with N values. However,
watch out for function call overhead!</p>
<p>When you have a lot of speedup code using the CPython C API and
values need to be shared across different modules, pass around Python
types that expose data as C structs and have the compiled code
access those C structs instead of going through the CPython
C API. By avoiding the Python C API for data access, you will
be avoiding most of its overhead.</p>
<p>Treating values as data (instead of having functions for accessing
everything) is more Pythonic. So another workaround for compiled
code is is to lazily create
<code>PyObject</code> instances. If you create a custom Python
type (<code>PyTypeObject</code>) to represent your complex values, you
can define the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_members">tp_members</a>
and/or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_getset">tp_getset</a>
fields to register custom C functions to resolve the value for
an attribute. If you are say writing a parser and you know that
consumers will only access a subset of the parsed fields, you can
quickly construct a type holding the raw data, return that type,
and have the Python attribute lookup call a C function which
resolves the <code>PyObject</code>. You can even defer parsing until this
function is called, saving additional overhead if a parse is
never required! This technique is quite rare (because it requires
writing a non-trivial amount of code against the Python C API).
But it can result in substantial wins.</p>
<h2>Pre-Sizing Collections</h2>
<p>This one applies to the CPython C API.</p>
<p>When creating collections like lists or dicts, use e.g.
<code>PyList_New()</code> + <code>PyList_SET_ITEM()</code> to populate new
collections when their size is known at collection creation
time. This will pre-size the collection to have capacity to hold
the final number of elements. And it skips checks when inserting
elements that the collection is large enough to hold them. When
creating collections of thousands of elements, this can save a
bit of overhead!</p>
<h2>Using Zero-copy in the C API</h2>
<p>The CPython C API really likes to make copies of things rather
than return references. For example,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/bytes.html#c.PyBytes_FromStringAndSize">PyBytes_FromStringAndSize()</a>
copies a <code>char*</code> to memory <em>owned</em> by Python. If you are doing
this for a large number of values or sufficiently large data,
we could be talking about gigabytes of memory I/O and associated
allocator overhead.</p>
<p>If writing high-performance code against the C API, you'll want
to become familiar with the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/buffer.html">buffer protocol</a>
and related types, like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/memoryview.html">memoryview</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>buffer protocol</em> is implemented by Python types and allows
the Python interpreter to <em>cast</em> a type to/from bytes. It essentially
allows the interpreter's C code to get a handle on a
<code>void*</code> of certain size representing the object. This allows you
to associate any address in memory with a <code>PyObject</code>. Many
functions operating on binary data transparently accept any
object implementing the <em>buffer protocol</em>. And if you are coding
against the C API and want to accept any object that can be
treated as bytes, you should be using the
<code>s*</code>, <code>y*</code> or <code>w*</code>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/arg.html#strings-and-buffers">format units</a>
when parsing function arguments.</p>
<p>By using the buffer protocol, you give the interpreter the
best opportunity possible to be using zero-copy operations and
avoiding having to copy bytes around in memory.</p>
<p>By using Python types like
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a>,
you are also allowing Python to reference slices of memory by
reference instead of by copy.</p>
<p>When you have gigabytes of data flowing through your Python
program, astute use of Python types that support zero-copy can
make a world of difference on performance. I once measured
that <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">python-zstandard</a>
was faster than some Python LZ4 bindings (LZ4 should be faster
than zstandard) because I made heavy use of the buffer protocol
and avoiding excessive memory I/O in python-zstandard!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post has outlined some of the things I've learned optimizing
Python programs over the years. This post is by no means
a comprehensive overview of Python performance techniques and
gotchas. I recognize that my use of Python is probably more
demanding than most and that the recommendations I made are
not applicable to many Python programs. <strong>You should not
mass update your Python code to e.g. inline functions and
remove attribute lookups after reading this post.</strong> As always,
when it comes to performance optimization, measure first and
optimize where things are observed to be slow. I highly recommend
<a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy">py-spy</a> for profiling Python
applications. That being said, it's hard to attach a time value
to low-level activity in the Python interpreter such as calling
functions and looking up attributes. So if you e.g. have a loop 
that you know is tight, experiment with suggestions in this post,
and see if you can measure an improvement!</p>
<p>Finally this post should not be interpreted as a dig against Python
or its performance properties. Yes, you can make arguments that
Python should or shouldn't be used in particular areas because of
performance properties. But Python is extremely versatile -
especially with PyPy delivering exceptional performance for a
dynamic programming language. The performance of Python is probably
<em>good enough</em> for most people. For better or worse, I have used
Python for uses cases that often feel like outliers across all
users. And I wanted to share my experiences such that others
know what life at the frontier is like. And maybe, just maybe, I
can cause the smart people who actually maintain Python distributions
to think about the issues I've had in more detail and provide
improvements to mitigate them.</p>
