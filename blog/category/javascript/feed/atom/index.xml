    <content type="html" xml:base="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2014/03/30/how-promises-and-tasks-are-improving-tests"><![CDATA[<p>I was a very early adoptor of promises and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Task.jsm">Tasks</a>
in Firefox's JavaScript code base. To me, promises on their own are ok.
The ability to chain promises together and tack one error handler on
the end sure beats the
<a href="http://tritarget.org/blog/2012/11/28/the-pyramid-of-doom-a-javascript-style-trap/">Pyramid of Doom</a>
and having to pass errors into callbacks everywhere. But what really
lured me in were tasks: using generators (then a feature only available
in SpiderMonkey) to represent async code flow as nice, easy-to-read
procedural flow that nearly every programming can relate to. It made
code much easier to read and grok. I've been using tasks ever since.</p>
<p>When I started writing new APIs that returned promises instead of using
callbacks, I found myself writing a lot of tests consuming promises and
using tasks. So, I
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=819033">added an add_task</a>
API to our xpcshell test harness to make writing task-based unit tests
involve less boilerplate. That API is now used heavily for new xpcshell
tests.</p>
<p>While I initially added <em>add_task()</em> to cut down on the boilerplate for
writing tests, I only recently realized it has another benefit: it's
helped cut down on hung tests!</p>
<p>Before, with callback-based APIs, we'd code tests like so:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nx">add_test</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">onThatThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="nx">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">success</span><span class="p">);</span>
     <span class="nx">run_next_test</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or another pattern:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nx">add_test</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">onThatThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// The next line throws an Error by accident!</span>
    <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">run_next_test</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In the first example, the test will hang if the callback never gets
called. The test harness driver will eventually terminate
the test (after a multi-second delay with no output). Not good.</p>
<p>In the second example, we are still susceptible to the callback not
being called. But we have a different problem: an untrapped Error is
thrown from a callback! This results in the same behavior:
<em>run_next_test()</em> (the function that says to advance to the next test)
won't execute and the test will hang until it times out.</p>
<p>A more proper way to write this test is:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nx">add_test</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">onThatThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ex</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">do_report_unexpected_exception</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ex</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="nx">run_next_test</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In reality, few people surround all their callbacks with try..catch
blocks because, well, it's a lot of typing and people don't always think
it's necessary (the test passes most of the time, doesn't it?).</p>
<p>What promises and task-based tests are doing is enabling us to write
more robust tests without all of the extra work. Here is how you would
use task-based tests:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nx">add_task</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="nx">do_something</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="c1">// The next line throws an Error by accident!</span>
  <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the Error thrown by the test function is thrown within the context
of an executing Task. It is caught by the Task and converted into a
rejected promise. <strong>The test harness sees that failure immediately
and no timeout occurs!</strong> This can cut down on overhead when writing
tests, especially if you are trying to debug a hang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the test is 4 lines versus 10. Less typing means you have
more time to write additional tests or you can focus on writing other
patches.</p>
<p>Finally, the task-based test functions are easier to understand. That 4
line, procedural test is much easier to grok than its callback-based
counterpart.</p>
<p>And before I conclude, I should mention that we can do more with
promises. For example, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=976205">bug 976205</a> is making uncaught promise errors turn into test failures!
There is also an awesome patch in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867742">bug 867742</a> to
introduce a unified JavaScript test harness API for defining JavaScript
tests in our tree (currently the APIs for xpcshell tests and mochitests
are different, leading to cognitive dissonance and lower productivity).
<strong>If you want to be a hero to the Firefox developer community, help
finish that patch.</strong></p>
<p>Given that so much Firefox feature development time (at Mozilla) is
spent writing and debugging tests, I encourage everyone to consider
promises and tasks for his or her next feature so that you can cut
down on development time and complete projects faster.</p>]]></content>
