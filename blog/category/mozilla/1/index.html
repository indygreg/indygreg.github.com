  <p>The Internet went crazy on Thursday when Google
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">announced a SHA-1 collision</a>.
This has spawned a lot of talk about the impact of SHA-1 in version
control. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Git) weighed in on the
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=148787047422954">Git mailing list</a> and on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/7tp2gYWQugL">Google+</a>.
There are also posts like
<a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2017-February/031623.html">SHA1 collisions make Git vulnerable to attakcs by third-parties, not just repo maintainers</a>
outlining the history of Git and SHA-1. On the Mercurial side,
Matt Mackall (the creator of Mercurial) authored a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">SHA-1 and Mercurial security article</a>.
(If you haven't read Matt's article, please do so now before
continuing.)</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute my own take on the problem with a slant towards
Mercurial and while also comparing Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1
collisions to Git's. Since this is a security topic, I'd like to
explicitly state that I'm not a cryptographer. However, I've worked on
a number of software components that do security/cryptography (like
Firefox Sync) and I'm pretty confident saying that my grasp on
cryptographic primitives and security techniques is better than the
average developer's.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions on a technical
level.</p>
<p>Mercurial, like Git, is <em>vulnerable</em> to SHA-1 collisions. Mercurial is
vulnerable because its logical storage mechanism (like Git's) indexes
tracked content by SHA-1. If two objects with differing content have the
same SHA-1, content under version control could be changed and detecting
that would be difficult or impossible. That's obviously bad.</p>
<p>But, Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions isn't as severe as Git's.
To understand why, we have to understand how each stores data.</p>
<p>Git's logical storage model is a content-addressable key-value store.
Values (<em>objects</em> in Git parlance) consist of a header identifying the
object type (commit, tree, blob, or tag), the size of the data (as a
string), and the raw content of the thing being stored. Common content
types are file content (blob), a list of files (tree), and a description
of a commit (commit). Keys in this blob store are SHA-1 hashes of objects.
All Git objects go into a single <em>namespace</em> in the Git repository's
<em>store</em>. A beneficial side-effect of this is data de-duplication: if the
same file is added to a Git repository, it's <em>blob</em> object will be
identical and it will only be stored once by Git. A detrimental
side-effect is that hash collisions are possible between any two objects,
irregardless of their type or location in the repository.</p>
<p>Mercurial's logical storage model is also content-addressable. However,
it is significantly different from Git's approach. Mercurial's logical
storage model allocates a separate sub-store for each tracked <em>path</em>.
If you run <code>find .hg/store -name '*.i'</code> inside a Mercurial repository,
you'll see these files. There is a separate file for each path
that has committed data. If you <code>hg add foo.txt</code> and <code>hg commit</code>, there
will be a <code>data/foo.txt.i</code> file holding data for <code>foo.txt</code>.
There are also special files <code>00changelog.i</code> and <code>00manifest.i</code> holding
data for commits/changesets and file lists, respectively. Each of these
<code>.i</code> files - a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/a185b903bda3/mercurial/help/internals/revlogs.txt">revlog</a> -
is roughly equivalent to an ordered collection of Git objects for a
specific tracked path. This means that Mercurial's store consists of
N discrete and independent namespaces for data. Contrast with Git's
single namespace.</p>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks are the opposite of those pointed out for
Git above: Mercurial doesn't have automatic content-based de-duplication
but it does provide some defense against hash collisions. Because each
logical path is independent of all others, a Mercurial repository will
happily commit two files with different content but same hashes. This
is more robust than Git because a hash collision is isolated to a single
logical path / revlog. In other words, a random file added to the
repository in directory <code>X</code> that has a hash collision with a file in
directory <code>Y</code> won't cause problems.</p>
<p>Mercurial also differs significantly from Git in terms of how the hash
is obtained. Git's hash is computed from raw content preceded by a header
derived directly from the object's role and size. (Takeaway: the header is
static and can be derived trivially.) Mercurial's hash is computed from
raw content preceded by a header. But that header consists of the 20 byte
SHA-1 hash(es) of the parent revisions in the revlog to which the content
is being added. This <em>chaining</em> of hashes means that the header is not
always static nor always trivially derived. This means that the same
content can be stored in the revlog under multiple hashes. It also means
that it is possible to store differing content having a hash collision
within the same revlog! But only under some conditions - Mercurial will
still barf in some scenarios if there is a hash collision within content
tracked by the revlog. This is different from Git's behavior, where the
same content <em>always</em> results in the same Git object hash. (It's worth
noting that a SHA-1 collision on data with a Git object header has not
yet been encountered in the wild.)</p>
<p>The takeaway from the above paragraphs is Mercurial's storage model
is slightly more robust against hash collisions than Git's because there
are multiple, isolated namespaces for storing content and because all
hashes are chained to previous content. So, when SHA-1 collisions
are more achievable and someone manages to create a collision for a
hash used by version control, Mercurial's storage layer will be able
to cope with that better than Git's.</p>
<p>But the concern about SHA-1 weakness is more about security than storage
robustness. The disaster scenario for version control is that an
attacker could replace content under version control, possibly
undetected. If one can generate a hash collision, then this is
possible. Mercurial's chaining of content provides some defense, but
it isn't sufficient.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">Matt Mackall</a>
that at the present time there are bigger concerns with content
safety than SHA-1 collisions. Namely, if you are an attacker, it is
much easier to introduce a subtle bug that contains a security
vulnerability than to introduce a SHA-1 collision. It is also
much easier to hack the canonical version control server (or any
user or automated agent that has permissions to push to the server)
and add a <em>bad</em> commit. Many projects don't have adequate defenses
to detect such <em>bad</em> commits. Ask yourself: if a bad actor pushed
a <em>bad</em> commit to my repository, would it be detected? Keep in mind
that spoofing author and committer metadata in commits is trivial.
<strong>The current state of Mercurial and Git rely primarily on trust -
not SHA-1 hashes - as their primary defense against malicious
actors.</strong></p>
<p>The desire to move away from SHA-1 has been on the radar of the
Mercurial project for years. For 10+ years, the <em>revlog</em> data
structure has allocated 32 bytes for hashes while only using 20 bytes
for SHA-1. And, the topic of SHA-1 weakness and desire to move to
something stronger has come up at the developer <em>sprints</em> for the
past several years. However, it has never been pressing enough to act
on because <em>there are bigger problems</em>. If it were easy to change, then
Mercurial likely would have done it already. But changing is not easy.
As soon as you introduce a new hash format in a repository, you've
potentially locked out all legacy versions of the Mercurial software
from accessing the repository (unless the repository stores multiple
hashes and allows legacy clients to access the legacy SHA-1 hashes).
There are a number of concerns from legacy compatibility (something
Mercurial cares deeply about) to user experience to even performance
(SHA-1 hashing even at 1000+MB/s floats to the top of performance
profiling for some Mercurial operations). I'm sure the topic will be
discussed heavily at the upcoming developers sprint in a few weeks.</p>
<p>While Mercurial should (and will eventually) replace SHA-1, I think
the biggest improvement Mercurial (or Git for that matter) can make
to repository <em>security</em> is providing a better mechanism for tracking
and auditing trust. Existing mechanisms for GPG signing every commit
aren't practical or are a non-starer for many workflows. And, they
rely on GPG, which has notorious end-user usability problems (I would
prefer my version control tool not subject me to toiling with GPG.)
I've thought about this topic considerably, authoring a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitSigningPlan">proposal for easier and more flexible commit signing</a>.
There is also a related proposal to establish a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitCustodyConcept">cryptographically meaningful chain-of-custody for a patch</a>.
There are some good ideas there. But, like all user-facing
cryptography, the devil is in the details. There are some hard
problems to solve, like how to manage/store public keys that were
used for signatures. While there is some prior art in version control
tools (see Monotone), it is far from a solved problem. And at the
end of the day, you are still left having to trust a set of keys
used to produce signatures.</p>
<p>While version control can keep using cryptographically strong hashes
to mitigate collisions within its storage layer to prevent content
swapping and can employ cryptographic signatures of tracked data,
there is still the issue of trust. Version control can give you the
tools for establishing and auditing trust. Version control can also
provide tools for managing trust relationships. But at the end of the
day, the actual act of trusting trust boils down to people making
decisions (possibly through corporate or project policies). This
will always be a weak link. Therefore, it's what malicious actors
will attack. The best your version control tool can do is give its
users the capability and tools to run a secure and verifiable
repository so that when bad content is inevitably added you can't
blame the version control tool for having poor security.</p>

  <p>MozReview - Mozilla's Review Board based code review tool - now
supports ingestion from Git. Previously, it only supported Mercurial.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install-git.html">Instructions</a>
for configuring Git with MozReview are available. Because blog posts
are not an appropriate medium for documenting systems and processes, I
will not say anything more here on how to use Git with MozReview.</p>
<p>Somewhat related to the introduction of Git support is an improved
mechanism for mapping commits to existing review requests.</p>
<p>When you submit commits to MozReview, MozReview has to decide how
to <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/commits.html#understanding-how-commits-are-mapped-to-review-requests">map</a>
those commits to review requests in Review Board. It has to choose
whether to recycle an existing review request or create a new one.
When recycling, is has to pick an appropriate one. If it chooses
incorrectly, wonky things can happen. For example, a review request
could switch to tracking a new and completely unrelated commit. That's
bad.</p>
<p>Up until today, our commit mapping algorithm was extremely simple. Yet
it seemed to work 90% of the time. However, a number of people
found the cracks and complained. With Git support coming online,
I had a feeling that Git users would find these cracks with higher
frequency than Mercurial users due to what I perceive to be
variations in the commit workflows of Git versus Mercurial. So,
I decided to proactively improve the commit mapping before the Git
users had time to complain.</p>
<p><strong>Both the Git and Mercurial MozReview client-side extensions now insert
a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> metadata line in commit messages.</strong> This line
effectively defines a (likely) unique ID that identifies the commit
across rewrites. When MozReview maps commits to review requests,
it uses this identifier to find matches. What this means is that
history rewriting (such as reordering commits) should be handled
well by MozReview and should not confuse the commit mapping
mechanism.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming the commit mapping mechanism is perfect. In fact,
I know of areas where it can still fall apart. But it is much
better than it was before. If you think you found a bug in the
commit mapping, don't hesitate to
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=MozReview">file a bug</a>.
Please have it block <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1243483">bug 1243483</a>.</p>
<p>A side-effect of introducing this improved commit mapping is that
commit messages will have a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> line in them. This
may startle some. Some may complain about the <em>spam</em>. Unfortunately,
there's no better alternative. Both Mercurial and Git do support a
hidden key-value dictionary for each commit object. In fact, the
MozReview Mercurial extension has been storing the very commit IDs
that now appear in the commit message in this dictionary for months!
Unfortunately, actually using this hidden dictionary for metadata
storage is riddled with problems. For example, some Mercurial
commands don't preserve all the metadata. And accessing or setting
this data from Git is painful. While I wish this metadata (which
provides little value to humans) were not located in the commit
message where humans could be bothered by it, it's really the only
practical place to put it. If people find it super annoying, we
could modify Autoland to strip it before landing. Although, I think
I like having it preserved because it will enable some useful
scenarios down the road, such as better workflows for uplift
requests. It's also worth noting that there is precedent for storing
unique IDs in commit messages for purposes of commit mapping in the
code review tool: <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11.5/user-changeid.html">Gerrit uses Change-ID lines</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the Git support and the more robust commit to review
request mapping mechanism!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I first started writing web services, I was a huge RESTful fan
boy. The architectural properties - especially the parts related to
caching and scalability - really jived with me. But as I've grown
older and gained experienced, I've realized that RESTful design,
like many aspects of software engineering, is more of a guideline
or ideal than a panacea. This post is about one of those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/webapi/">Review Board's Web API</a>
is RESTful. It's actually one of the better examples of a RESTful API
I've seen. There is a very clear separation between <em>resources</em>. And
everything - and I mean everything - is a resource. <em>Hyperlinks</em> are
used for the purposes described in Roy T. Fielding's dissertation.
I can tell the people who authored this web API understood RESTful
design and they succeeded in transferring that knowledge to a web API.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview code review tool</a>
is built on top of Review Board. We've made a number of customizations.
The most significant is the ability to submit a series of commits
as one logical review series. This occurs as a side-effect of a
<em>hg push</em> to the code review repository. Once your changesets
are pushed to the remote repository, that server issues a number of
Review Board Web API HTTP requests to reviewboard.mozilla.org to
create the review requests, assign reviewers, etc. This is mostly all
built on the built-in web API endpoints offered by Review Board.</p>
<p>Because Review Board's Web API adheres to RESTful design principles
so well, turning a series of commits into a series of review requests
takes a lot of HTTP requests. For each commit, we have to perform
something like 5 HTTP requests to define the server state. For
series of say 10 commits (which aren't uncommon since we try to
encourage the use of microcommits), this can add up to dozens of
HTTP requests! And that's just counting the HTTP requests to
Review Board: because we've integrated Review Board with Bugzilla,
events like publishing result in additional RESTful HTTP requests from
Review Board to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, submitting and publishing a series of 10
commits consumes somewhere between 75 and 100 HTTP requests! While
the servers are all in close physical proximity (read: low network
latencies), we are reusing TCP connections, and each HTTP request
completes fairly quickly, the overhead adds up. <strong>It's not uncommon
for publishing commit series to take over 30s.</strong> This is unacceptable
to developers. We want them to publish commits for review as quickly
as possible so they can get on with their next task. Humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>Over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229468">bug 1220468</a>,
I implemented a new batch submit web API for Review Board and converted
the Mercurial server to call it instead of the classic, RESTful Review
Board web APIs. <strong>In other words, I threw away the RESTful properties
of the web API and implemented a monolith API doing exactly what we
need.</strong> The result is a drastic reduction in net HTTP requests. In our
tests, submitting a series of 20 commits for review reduced the HTTP
request count by 104! Furthermore, the new API endpoint performs
all modifications in a single database transaction. Before, each HTTP
request was independent and we had bugs where failures in the middle of
a HTTP request series left the server in inconsistent and unexpected
state. The new API is significantly faster and more atomic as a bonus.
The main reason the new implementation isn't yet nearly instantaneous
is because we're still performing several RESTful HTTP requests to
Bugzilla from Review Board. But there are plans for Bugzilla to
implement the batch APIs we need as well, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>(I don't want to blame the Review Board or Bugzilla maintainers for
their RESTful web APIs that are giving MozReview a bit of scaling pain.
MozReview is definitely abusing them almost certainly in ways that
weren't imagined when they were conceived. To their credit, the
maintainers of both products have recognized the limitations in their
APIs and are working to address them.)</p>
<p>As much as I still love the properties of RESTful design, there are
practical limitations and consequences such as what I described
above. The older and more experienced I get, the less patience I have
for tolerating architecturally pure implementations that sacrifice
important properties, such as ease of use and performance.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the properties of RESTful design are
applicable to <em>microservices</em> as well. When you create a new service
in a microservices architecture, you are creating more overhead for
clients that need to speak to multiple services, making changes less
transactional and atomic, and making it difficult to consolidate
multiple related requests into a higher-level, simpler, and performant
API. I recommend
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">Microservice Trade-Offs</a>
for more on this subject.</p>
<p>There is a place in the world for RESTful and microservice
architectures. And as someone who does a lot of server-side engineering,
I sympathize with wanting scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. But
like most complex problems, you need to be cognizant of trade-offs. It is
also important to not get too caught up with architectural purity if
it is getting in the way of delivering a simple, intuitive, and fast
product for your users. So, please, follow me down from the ivory tower.
The air was cleaner up there - but that was only because it was so
distant from the swamp at the base of the tower that surrounds every
software project.</p>

  <p>Most of Mozilla gathered in Orlando in December for an all hands meeting.
If you attended any of the plenary sessions, you probably heard people
like David Bryant and Lawrence Mandel make references to improving the
Firefox build system and related tools. Well, the cat is out of the bag:
<strong>Mozilla will be investing heavily in the Firefox build system and related
tooling in 2016!</strong></p>
<p>In the past 4+ years, the Firefox build system has mostly been held
together and incrementally improved by a loose coalition of people who
cared. We had a period in 2013 where a number of people were making
significant updates (this is when moz.build files happened). But for the
past 1.5+ years, there hasn't really been a coordinated effort to
improve the build system - just a lot of one-off tasks and
(much-appreciated) individual heroics. This is changing.</p>
<p>Improving the build system is a high priority for Mozilla in 2016.
And investment has already begun. In Orlando, we had a marathon 3 hour
meeting planning work for Q1. At least 8 people have committed to
projects in Q1.</p>
<p>The focus of work is split between immediate short-term wins and
longer-term investments. <strong>We also decided to prioritize the Firefox and
Fennec developer workflows (over Gecko/Platform) as well as the
development experience on Windows.</strong> This is because these areas have
been under-loved and therefore have more potential for impact.</p>
<p>Here are the projects we're focusing on in Q1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey artifact based builds for Firefox and Fennec (download
  pre-built binaries so you don't have to spend 20 minutes compiling
  C++)</li>
<li>Running tests from the source directory (so you don't have to copy
  tens of thousands of files to the object directory)</li>
<li>Speed up configure / prototype a replacement</li>
<li>Telemetry for mach and the build system</li>
<li>NSPR, NSS, and (maybe) ICU build system rewrites</li>
<li><em>mach build faster</em> improvements</li>
<li>Improvements to build rules used for building binaries (enables
  non-make build backends)</li>
<li>mach command for analyzing C++ dependencies</li>
<li>Deploy automated testing for <em>mach bootstrap</em> on TaskCluster</li>
</ul>
<p>Work has already started on a number of these projects. I'm optimistic
2016 will be a watershed year for the Firefox build system and the
improvements will have a drastic positive impact on developer
productivity.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few minutes ago, I formally enabled a new replication system
for <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>. For the curious,
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/replication.html">technical details</a>
are available.</p>
<p>This impacts you because pushes to hg.mozilla.org should now be
significantly faster. For example, pushes to mozilla-inbound
that used to take 15s now take 2s. Pushes to Try that used to
take 45s now take 10s. (Yes, the old replication system really
added a lot of overhead.) Pushes to hg.mozilla.org are still not
as fast as they could be due to us running the service on 5 year
old hardware (we plan to buy new servers this year) and due to the
use of NFS on the server. However, I believe push latency is now
reasonable for every repo except Try.</p>
<p>The new replication system opens the door to a number of future
improvements. We'd like to stand up mirrors in multiple data
centers - perhaps even offices - so clients have the fastest
connectivity and so we have a better disaster recovery story.
The new replication system facilitates this.</p>
<p>The new replication log is effectively a unified pushlog -
something people have wanted for years. While there is not yet
a public API for it, one could potentially be exposed, perhaps
indirectly via Pulse.</p>
<p>It is now trivial for us to stand up new consumers of the
replication log that react to repository events merely milliseconds
after they occur. This should eventually result in downstream
systems like build automation and conversion to Git repos starting
and thus completing faster.</p>
<p>Finally, the new replication system has been running unofficially for
a few weeks, so you likely won't notice anything different today
(other than removal of some printed messages when you push). What
changed today is the new system is enabled by default and we have
no plans to continue supporting or operating the legacy system.
Good riddance.</p>
