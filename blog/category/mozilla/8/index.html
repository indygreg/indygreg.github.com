  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Since I published my <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/06/25/improving-mozilla%27s-build-system/">brain dump
post</a>
on improving Mozilla's build system for Gecko applications (including
Firefox and Firefox OS), there has been some exciting progress.</p>
<p>It wasn't stated in that original post, but the context for that post
was to propose a plan in preparation of a meeting between the core
contributors to the build system at Mozilla. I'm pleased to report that
the plan was generally well-received.</p>
<p>We pretty much all agreed that parts 1, 2, and 3 are all important and
we should actively work towards them. Parts 4, 5, and 6 were a bit more
contentious. There are some good parts and some bad parts. We're not
ready to adopt them just quite yet. (Don't bother reading the original
post to look up what these parts corresponded to - I'll cover that
later.)</p>
<p>Since that post and meeting, there has also been additional discussion
around more specifics. I am going to share with you now where we stand.</p>
<h2>BuildSplendid</h2>
<p><strong>BuildSplendid</strong> is an umbrella term associated with projects/goals to
make the developer experience (including building) better - more
splendid if you will.</p>
<p><strong>BuildSplendid</strong> started as the name of my personal Git branch for
hacking on the build system. I'm encouraging others to adopt the term
because, well, it is easier to refer to (people like project codenames).
If it doesn't stick, that's fine by me - there are other terms that
will.</p>
<h2>BuildFaster</h2>
<p>An important project inside <em>BuildSplendid</em> is <strong>BuildFaster</strong>.</p>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> focuses on the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the <em>existing</em> build system faster, better, stronger (but not
   harder).</li>
<li>Making changes to the build system to facilitate the <em>future</em> use of
   alternate build backends (like Tup or Ninja). Work to enable Visual
   Studio, Xcode, etc project generation also falls here.</li>
</ol>
<p>The distinction between these goals can be murky. But, I'll try.</p>
<p>Falling squarely in #1 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the buildbot infrastructure to use pymake on Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Falling in #2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making Makefile.in's data-centric</li>
<li>Supporting multiple build backends</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflated between the two are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring Makefile's no-op if nothing has changed</li>
<li>Optimizing existing make rules. This involves merging related
  functionality as well as eliminating clown shoes in existing rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two goals of <em>BuildFaster</em> roughly map to the short-term and long-term
strategies, respectively. There is consensus that recursive make (our
existing build backend) does not scale and we will plateau in terms of
performance no matter how optimal we make it. That doesn't mean we are
giving up on it: there are things we can and should do so our existing
non-recursive make backend builds faster.</p>
<p>In parallel, we will also work towards the longer-term solution of
supporting alternate build backends. <strong>This includes non-recursive
make</strong> as well as things like Tup, Ninja, and even Visual Studio and
Xcode. (I consider non-recursive make to be a separate build backend
because changing our existing Makefile.in's to support non-recursive
execution effectively means rewriting the input files (Makefile.in's).
At that point, you've invented a new build backend.)</p>
<p>For people who casually interact with the build system, these two goals
will blend together. It is not important for most to know what bucket
something falls under.</p>
<h3>BuildFaster Action Items</h3>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> action items are being tracked in Bugzilla using the
[BuildFaster:*] whiteboard annotation.</p>
<p>There is no explicit tracking bug for the short-term goal (#1). Instead,
we are relying on the whiteboard annotation.</p>
<p>We are tracking the longer-term goal of supporting alternate build
backends at <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774049">bug 774049</a>.</p>
<p>The most important task to help us reach the goals is to make our
Makefile.in's data centric. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makefile.in's <strong>must</strong> consist of only simple variable assignment</li>
<li>Makefile.in's <strong>must</strong> not rely on being evaluated to perform variable
  assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, our build config should be defined by static key-value pairs.</p>
<p>This translates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move all rules out of Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769378">bug 769378</a></li>
<li>Remove use of $(shell) from Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769390">bug 769390</a></li>
<li>Remove filesystem functions from Makefile.in's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769407">bug 769407</a></li>
<li>And more, as we identify the need</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have these tracking bugs on file, we still don't have bugs
filed that track individual Makefile.in's that need updated. <strong>If you
are a contributor, you can help by doing your part to file bugs for your
Makefile.in's.</strong> If your Makefile.in violates the above rules, please
file a bug in the <strong>Build Config</strong> component of the product it is under
(typically <strong>Core</strong>). See the tree of the above bugs for examples.</p>
<p>Also part of <em>BuildFaster</em> (but not relevant to most) is the task of
changing the build system to support multiple backends. Currently,
pieces like <em>configure</em> assume the Makefile.in to Makefile conversion is
always what is wanted. These parts will be worked on by core
contributors to the build system and thus aren't of concern to most.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that a lot of the work to <em>purify</em>
Makefile.in's to be data centric will look like a lot of busy work with
little immediate gain. The real benefits to this work will manifest
down the road. That being said, removing rules from Makefile.in's and
implementing things as rules in rules.mk helps ensure that the
implementation is proper (rules.mk is coded by make ninjas and thus
probably does things <em>right</em>). This can lead to faster build times.</p>
<h2>mozbuild</h2>
<p><strong>mozbuild</strong> is a Python package that provides an API to the build system.</p>
<p>What <em>mozbuild</em> will contain is still up in the air because it hasn't
landed in mozilla-central yet. In the code I'm waiting on review to
uplift to mozilla-central, <em>mozbuild</em> contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>An API for invoking the build system backend (e.g. launching make). It
  basically reimplements client.mk because client.mk sucks and needs to
  be replaced.</li>
<li>An API for launching tests easily. This reimplements functionality in
  testsuite-targets.mk, but in a much cleaner way. Running a single test
  can now be done with a single Python function call. This may sound
  boring, but it is very useful. You just import a module and pass a
  filesystem path to a test file to a function and a test runs. Boom!</li>
<li>Module for extracting compiler warnings from build output and storing
  in a persisted database for post-build retrieval. Compiler warning
  tracking \o/</li>
<li>Module for converting build system output into structured logs. It
  records things like time spent in different directories, etc. We could
  use this for tracking build performance regressions. We just need a
  arewe*yet.com domain...</li>
<li>A replacement for .mozconfig's that sucks less (stronger validation,
  settings for not just build config, convenient Python API, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, upcoming features which I haven't yet tried to land in
mozilla-central include:</p>
<ul>
<li>API for extracting metadata from Makefile.in's and other frontend
  files. Want a Python class instance describing the IDLs defined in an
  individual Makefile.in or across the entire tree? <em>mozbuild</em> can provide
  that. This functionality will be used to configure alternate build
  backends.</li>
<li>Build backend API which allows for different build backends to be
  configured (e.g. recursive make, Tup, Ninja, etc). When we support
  multiple build backends, they'll live in <em>mozbuild</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> can really be thought of as a clean backend to the build
system and related functionality (like running tests). Everything in
<em>mozbuild</em> could exist in make files or in .py files littered in
<em>build/</em>, <em>config/</em>, etc. But, that would involve maintaining make files
and/or not having a cohesive API. I wanted a clean slate that was free
from the burdens of the existing world. <em>mozbuild</em> was born.</p>
<p>I concede that there will be non-clear lines of division between
<em>mozbuild</em> and other Python packages and/or Mozilla modules. For
example, is <em>mozbuild</em> the appropriate location to define an API for
taking the existing build configuration and launching a Mochitest? I'm
not sure. For now, I'm stuffing functionality inside <em>mozbuild</em> unless
there is a clear reason for it to exist elsewhere. If we want to
separate (because of module ownership issues, for example), we can do
that.</p>
<p>My vision for <em>mozbuild</em> is for it to be the answer to the question
<em>how does the Mozilla build system work?</em> You should be able to say,
<em>look at the code in python/mozbuild and you will have all the answers.</em></p>
<h3>mozbuild Action Items</h3>
<p>The single action item for <em>mozbuild</em> is getting it landed. I have code
written that I think is good enough for an initial landing (with obvious
shortcomings being addressed in follow-up bugs). It just needs some love
from reviewers.</p>
<p>Landing <em>mozbuild</em> is tracked in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a>. I
initially dropped a monolithic patch. I have since started splitting
bits up into bite-sized patches to facilitate faster, smaller reviews.
(See the blocking bugs.)</p>
<h2>mach</h2>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> is just a Python package - an API. It has no frontend.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>mach</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mach</strong> is a command-line frontend to <em>mozbuild</em> and beyond.</p>
<p>Currently, <em>mach</em> provides some convenient shortcuts for performing
common tasks. e.g. you can run a test by tab-completing to its filename
using your shell. It also provides nifty output in supported terminals,
including colorizing and a basic progress indicator during building.</p>
<p>You can think of <em>mach</em> as a replacement for <em>client.mk</em> and other make
targets. But, <em>mach</em>'s purpose doesn't end there. My vision for <em>mach</em>
is for it to be the one-stop shop for all your mozilla-central
interaction needs.</p>
<p>From a mozilla-central tree, you should be able to type
<strong>./mach <action></strong> and do whatever you need to do. This could be
building Firefox, running tests, uploading a patch to Bugzilla, etc.</p>
<p>I'm capturing ideas for <em>mach</em> features in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774108">bug 774108</a>.</p>
<h3>mach Action Items</h3>
<p><em>mach</em> is in the same boat as <em>mozbuild</em>: it's waiting for reviewer
love. If you are interested in reviewing it, please let me know.</p>
<p>Once <em>mach</em> lands, I will be looking to the larger community to improve
it. I want people to go wild implementing features. I believe that
<em>mach</em> will have a significant positive impact on driving contributions
to Mozilla because it will make the process much more streamlined and
less prone to error. I think it is a no-brainer to check in <em>mach</em> as
soon as possible so these wins can be realized.</p>
<p>There is an open question of who will own <em>mach</em> in terms of module
ownership. <em>mach</em> isn't really part of anything. Sure, it interacts with
the build system, testing code, tools, etc. But, it isn't actually part
of any of that. Maybe a new module will be created for it. I'm not
familiar with how the modules system works and I would love to chat with
someone about options here.</p>
<h2>Project Interaction</h2>
<p>How are all of these projects related?</p>
<p><em>BuildFaster</em> is what everyone is working on today. It currently focuses
on making the existing recursive make based build backend faster using
whatever means necessary. <em>BuildFaster</em> could theoretically evolve to
cover other build backends (like non-recursive make). Time will tell
what falls under the <em>BuildFaster</em> banner.</p>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> is immediately focused on providing the functionality to
enable <em>mach</em> to land.</p>
<p><em>mach</em> is about improving the overall developer experience when
it comes to contributing to Firefox and other in-tree applications (like
Firefox OS). It's related to the build system in that it provides a nice
frontend to it. That's the only relationship. <em>mach</em> isn't part of the
build system (at least not yet - it may eventually be used to perform
actions on buildbot machines).</p>
<p>Down the road, <em>mozbuild</em> will gain lots of new features core to the
build system. It will learn how to extract metadata from Makefile.in's
which can be used by other build backends. It will define a build
backend interface and the various build backends will be implemented
in mozbuild. Aspects of the existing build system currently implemented in
make files or in various Python files scattered across the tree will be
added to <em>mozbuild</em> and exposed with a clean, reusable, and testable
API.</p>
<p>Today, <em>BuildFaster</em> is the important project with all the attention.
When <em>mach</em> lands, it will (hopefully) gather a lot of attention. But,
it will be from a different group (the larger contributor community -
not just build system people).</p>
<p><em>mozbuild</em> today is only needed to support <em>mach</em>. But, once <em>mozbuild</em>
lands and <em>mach</em> is on its own, <em>mozbuild</em>'s purpose  will shift to support
<em>BuildFaster</em> and other activities under the <em>BuildSplendid</em> banner.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us. Please look at the bugs linked above
and help out in any way you can.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>It is hard to believe that my first day as a full-time employee of Mozilla
was one year ago today! But, here I am. And, I'd like to think the past
year is worth reflecting on.</p>
<p>So, what have I been doing for a year? Good question!</p>
<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
<ul>
<li>First patch and commit to Firefox: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673209">bug 673209</a>.
  Yes, my first patch was to configure.in. It scared me too.</li>
<li>Number of non-merge commits: 133</li>
<li>Number of merge commits: 49</li>
<li>Number of reviews: 31</li>
<li>Favorite commit message: <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/88d02a07d390">88d02a07d390</a>
  <em>Fix bug 725478 because we run a buggy Python released almost 5 years
  ago; r=tigerblood</em> (it was a bustage follow-up).</li>
<li>Biggest mistake: buildbotcustom change to packaging turned every tree
  red. All of them. Including release. I think I have philor on record
  saying it is the worst burnage he's ever seen. Mission accomplished!</li>
</ul>
<p>Major User-Facing Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote add-on sync for Firefox (with help from many others, especially
  Dave Townsend and Blair McBride).</li>
<li>Principle reviewer for Apps in the Cloud (apps sync) in Firefox. (Are
  reviewers allowed to take credit?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, when I see that list, I think <em>that's all?</em> It doesn't feel
like a lot, especially since I work on a major user-facing feature
(Firefox Sync). I do contribute to more. But, if you ask me what the
most significant impact was, I don't think I can call anything else out
as <em>major</em>.</p>
<p>There are certainly a lot of minor things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually managed to understand how Firefox Sync works, including the
  crypto model. I even <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/sync/storageformat5.html">documented</a>
  it! I don't think I knew any of that when I started (I basically knew
  that Firefox Sync was using strong client-side encryption. What that
  meant, I had no clue.)</li>
<li>Filed initial bugs (including some patches) to compile mozilla-central
  on Windows 8 and MSVC 2011. By the time people started working on
  Metro development, mozilla-build, configure, and the like already
  supported building.</li>
<li>Configured <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/sync-android/">Android Sync Jenkins Builder</a>.
  I'm told the Android Sync team loves it! You gotta love all the
  built-in dashboards. I really wish we had this for mozilla-central.</li>
<li>Made xpcshell test harness write xUnit files. Machine readable output
  of test results, baby!</li>
<li>Implement <em>send tab to device</em> API in Firefox Sync. Too bad we don't
  have UX to use it :(</li>
<li>Implemented testing-only JavaScript modules. So, instead of the hack
  that is [head] files in tests, you can
  <em>Cu.import("resource://testing-common/foo.js");</em></li>
<li>Made test package generation quieter. This made build logs about 30%
  smaller. This means you can get at build results faster.</li>
<li>Hacked around with JavaScript code coverage using the JS Debugger API.
  Failed in the process. But, I learned a lot about the JS Debugger API,
  so I consider it a win.</li>
<li>Rewrote Firefox Sync's record reconciling algorithm. The old one was
  full of subtle data loss corner cases. The new algorithm is much more
  robust (we think - even with 3 reviewers there was still some head
  scratching).</li>
<li>Emancipated lots of generic JavaScript code from the Sync tree into
  the a <em>services-common</em> package. This anticipated Apps in the Cloud
  and notifications' requirement to use this functionality and allowed
  those projects to get going quicker. At this point, we're effectively
  running a mini Toolkit. We really need to port some of this
  <em>upstream</em>.</li>
<li>Helped design the <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/storage/apis-2.0.html">next version</a>
  of the HTTP service to be used by Sync.</li>
<li>Implemented a standalone JavaScript implementation of the above. The
  production server used by Mozilla runs on Python (running the Python
  server in Mozilla's test environment would be too difficult). The
  server was also implemented using just the spec. This allowed us to
  clarify many parts of the spec. The Python functional tests can also
  be executed against the JS server. This gives us confidence that
  functionality is equivalent and tests hitting the test/JS server will
  behave the same as if they are hitting the production Python server.</li>
<li>Implemented a standalone JavaScript
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/services/common/storageservice.js">client</a>  for the above service. Previously, all the logic for this was scattered
  over about a dozen files and was notoriously difficult to audit and
  update. I also think it is a decent example of good code.  Clean.
  Highly documented. No hacks.</li>
<li>Reviewed a skeleton for the notifications service, which will
  eventually power browser notifications in Firefox.</li>
<li>Build system patches to better support Clang. Thankfully, Rafael
  Espíndola has been our Clang champion as of late and is now ensuring
  the bleeding edge of Clang does not break the tree. Thanks, Rafael! (I
  actually think he is in the process of switching our OS X builds to
  use Clang as I type this!)</li>
<li>Worked with security and crypto people to devise the security model
  behind the next version of Firefox Sync. (Brian Warner and Ben Adida
  have been doing most of the crypto work. I'm mostly on the sidelines
  making sure they design a system that can easily interop with Sync.)</li>
<li>Helped devise the <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/sync/storageformat6.html">next version</a>
  of Sync's server-side storage format. This will make the next version
  of Sync faster and able to hold more data at lower server cost.</li>
<li>Gave lots of love to documentation at
  <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/">https://docs.services.mozilla.com/</a>
  (especially the Sync docs). It's almost at the point where others can
  implement Sync clients without having to ask one of the fewer than 10
  people on the planet who actually know.</li>
<li>Contributed many small patches to the build system. Mostly general
  cleanup so far. Although, I have much bigger plans in the works.</li>
<li>Many miscellaneous small things. (I get distracted easily.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that list doesn't seem too shabby. But, a lot of it is smaller
ticket items. I don't think there's anything there worth writing home
about.  Whatever. The future is looking bright for Firefox Sync (Persona
integration will make Sync usable by millions more) and new sync
backends are coming (including search engine sync). So, I'm fine with
not having a longer list of big ticket contributions after only a year.</p>
<h2>On Ramping up at Mozilla</h2>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I had a difficult time getting into
the groove at Mozilla and my first months (dare I say my first half
year) were unproductive by my personal standards.</p>
<p>I can't say I wasn't warned. My manager (Mike Connor) told me
multiple times that it would happen. I was skeptical, insteading
rationalizing that my previous track record of learnly quickly
would hold. He was right. I was wrong. I got fat from the humble pie.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. For starters, I was starting a new
job. It's almost impossible achieve 100% productivity on your first day.
Second, I was working with tools I knew little about, including
JavaScript and especially including the flavor of JavaScript used
inside Firefox. (Short version: the JavaScript within Firefox is awesome
in that it implements bleeding-edge features of the language.
Unfortunately, the JavaScript inside Firefox/Gecko is contaminated
by this blight called XPCOM. It makes things ugly and not very
JavaScript-y. XPCOM also makes the learning curve that much harder
because now you have to learn multiple technologies at the same time.)
It was daunting.</p>
<p>Not helping matters was the fact that Firefox Sync is complicated.
Syncing data is in of itself a difficult problem. Throw in remote
servers, an HTTP protocol, a encryption, and interaction with systems
inside Firefox that are themselves complicated, and you have a <strong>hard</strong>
problem. My first months were literally spent being a thorn in Philipp
von Wieter^H^H^H^H^H^H philikon's side, barraging him with an endless
stream of questions. I am forever in beer debt to him because of this.
When Philipp left the team to work on Boot 2 Gecko and the rest of the
Firefox Sync team was retasked to work on Android Sync shortly
thereafter, I was on my own little island to manage Firefox Sync.
I kind of felt like Tom Hanks' character in <em>Castaway</em>.</p>
<p>If I have one piece of advice for people starting at Mozilla it's this:
be prepared to be humbled by your own ignorance. There is a lot to
learn. It's not easy. Don't feel bad when you struggle. The payoff is
worth it.</p>
<h2>On Life at Mozilla</h2>
<p>Despite the hurdles I initially faced ramping up at Mozilla, life at
Mozilla is great. This mostly stems from the people, of course.</p>
<p>If you are just looking for technical excellence, I think Mozilla has
one of the highest concentrations of any company in the world. Sure,
larger companies will have <em>more</em> amazing individuals. But, the number
per capita at Mozilla is just staggering. I don't know how many times
I've met or talked with someone only to find out later they are
considered to be one of the best in his or her respective field. Reading
Mozilla's phonebook is like looking at a <em>Who's Who</em> list. For someone
like me who loves being a sponge for knowledge, Mozilla is an environment
in which I can thrive. Just thinking back at everything I've learned in
the past year makes my mind asplode.</p>
<p>On the personal front, the personalities of Mozillians are also top
notch. People are generally helpful and supportive. (They need to be for
an open source project to thrive.) People recognize good ideas when they
hear them and there is comparatively few political battles to be won
when enacting change. People themselves are generally interesting and
passionate about the world and the work they do. If you are living
inside the Mozilla bubble, you may not realize how lucky you have it.
I could give specific examples, but I'd be writing all night. Just
take my word for it.</p>
<p>If you need something to whet your appetite, just check out the
zaniness that is <a href="http://mozillamemes.tumblr.com/">Mozilla Memes</a>.
I don't expect you to understand many of the posts unless you are a
Mozillian or follower of Reddit and know what internet memes are. But, if
you are either, it pretty much sums up a large part of the culture for
you. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in one giant, happy meme.</p>
<p>One of the aspects I love most about working at Mozilla is I finally
feel that my career interests are aligned with an organization I
philosophically agree with. Just read the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. What's
not to like?</p>
<p>This is one of the primary factors that convinced me to join Mozilla.
After Microsoft acquired the startup where I had my first post-college
job (Tellme Networks), I could never hold my head high in Silicon Valley
among my friends in the tech sector. <em>Normal</em> people and those outside
of Silicon Valley were like, "Microsoft, cool!" But, something just
didn't feel right about saying I worked for them. I felt like I was working
for the Empire while I really wanted to be working for the Rebel Alliance.
I felt like I had to atone for my time at Microsoft. I felt like I needed
to cleanse my soul. Mozilla was an obvious answer.</p>
<p>(I don't mean to disparage Microsoft. I actually think the culture has
changed since the days when their behavior earned them the reputation
that Silicon Valley stills holds them accountable for. Still, I would
not work for them in Silicon Valley. Anyway, I'm not here to talk about
the past.)</p>
<p>Mozilla is an organization I'm proud to work for. I exercise that pride
by frequently wearing my awesome Firefox hoodie. Nearly every time I do,
random people come up to me and say how they love Firefox and/or what
Mozilla does for the world. Every time they do, it brings a smile to my
face. This constantly reinforces what I know to be true: that I'm
working for a great organization.</p>
<h2>Future at Mozilla</h2>
<p>I'm already looking forward to the next year at Mozilla. It is already
shaping up to be much, much more productive than my first.</p>
<p>On the roadmap, all of my hacking about with the build system is about
to pay dividends. Ever since my first day at Mozilla I have been
frustrated with the build system and the developer experience one must
go through to contribute to Firefox. After many months of casual (mostly
evenings and weekends) experimentation, my work is about to pay off.</p>
<p>I have successfully formulated a <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/06/25/improving-mozilla%27s-build-system/">plan of attack</a>
and helped convince others this is what we need to do. We have since
<a href="http://coop.deadsquid.com/2012/07/reviving-buildfaster-plan-of-attack/">committed</a>
to the fundamental components of that plan and are
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774049">tracking</a> its
progress. (I don't mean to take sole or even primary responsibility for
this as the credit resides with a number of people. But, I would like to
think that the dozens of times I championed aspects of this plan in IRC
and in hallway chats before I was the first person to articulate it in a
post helped lay the groundwork for the eventual acceptance of this
project.) Once we see progress on this project, great things will come
from it. I promise.</p>
<p>My work towards making the build system faster had an unintended
consequence: the creation of a new tool that serves as a frontend to the
build system. One day, I took a step backwards and realized that the
potential for such a tool is much greater than simply interacting with
the build system. So, I extracted that work from my build system
hacking and polished it up a bit. It is now
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">one review away</a>
from landing. When it does, thousands of Firefox developers will have a
much better experience when developing Firefox. And, my hope is for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=774108">many more features</a>
to follow to make it even more awesome, especially for first-time
contributors. I believe this is important to help advance Mozilla's
Mission.</p>
<p>Improving the developer experience of Firefox is exciting and it will
likely make a lot of people really happy. But, it's neither the most
exciting nor most important project I'll contribute to in the upcoming
year. The most exciting and important project for me will be
refactoring Firefox Sync to make it faster, more robust, sync more data,
and, most importantly, usable by more people.</p>
<p>Firefox Sync stands out from similar products in that it keeps your data
safe. Really safe. I
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/04/08/comparing-the-security-and-privacy-of-browser-syncing/">blogged</a>
about this previously. But, I intentionally kept the tone of that post
neutral and factual. The truth is that the security model of Firefox Sync
makes it look like nearly all other products aren't even trying. I take
immense pride in working on a data-sharing feature that makes users'
lives better <strong>without undermining security</strong>. Firefox Sync stands in
rare company in this regard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our zeal for the best security possible, we designed a
product that isn't usable by the majority of people because it is too
complicated to set up and is prone to losing your data. In the end, this
doesn't really serve the overall Firefox user base.</p>
<p>We've been hard at work devising the next version of Firefox Sync which
will retain the optimum security and privacy settings of the existing
product while extending usability at nearly-comparable security and
ofer data recovery to the vast majority of our users. <strong>This is huge.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I'm pretty damn excited about my next year at Mozilla.</p>

  <p>Makefiles. Love them or hate them, they are ubiquitous. For projects
like Firefox (which has on the order of 1500 Makefiles), Makefiles
aren't going away any time soon. This despite that newer - arguably
better - build system (such as CMake and GYP) exist.</p>
<p>Many have decried the numerous ways in which GNU make and make files
suck. I won't pile on here. Instead, please read
<a href="http://www.conifersystems.com/whitepapers/gnu-make/">What's Wrong with GNU make</a>
for a great overview.</p>
<p>Despite the many flaws with make, I would argue that the single most
significant one is the slow speed often associated with it. People
lauding make replacements (such as
<a href="http://martine.github.com/ninja/">Ninja</a>) almost always emphasize this
one aspect above all others. (OK, Ninja isn't exactly a make replacement,
but the execution aspects are comparable.)</p>
<p>Why is make slow? It is almost always due to the use of recursive make.
This is make executing itself recursively, usually as it traverses a
directory tree. This is how Mozilla's build system works. You start in
one directory. Then, for each directory defined in the <em>DIRS</em> variable,
make invokes make in that directory. In Mozilla's case, we amplify this
by performing multiple passes over the directory tree - an <em>export</em> pass
that installs header files, etc into a common directory, a <em>libs</em> pass
that does most of the compilation, and a <em>tools</em> pass which performs
other miscellaneous actions. Each of these is a recursive make
iteration. As we say at Mozilla: clown shoes.</p>
<p>The deficiencies of recursive make and a workaround are called out in
the classic paper
<a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf">Recursive Make Considered Harmful</a>.
Despite its age, it is still relevant - GNU make hasn't changed that
much, after all. The thesis of the paper can be boiled down to the fact
that make assembles a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then executes it.
Using recursive make, you are assembling N DAGs instead of of 1. Each DAG
must be executed separately. This adds execution overhead. On top of
that, since the DAGs are separate, you are either
a) missing information from each DAG (it doesn't know about other
DAGs) thus creating an incomplete and possibly error-prone dependency
graph or b) duplicating information in multiple DAGs, creating more
work for make in aggregate.</p>
<p>The solution for this is non-recursive make. That's just a fancy way of
saying <em>create 1 monolithic DAG and execute it once</em> (as opposed to N
separate DAGs with at least N invocations of make). Modern build systems
like Ninja do this. While these build systems have other properties that
contribute to faster execution times, in my opinion the single feature
that has the greatest impact is consolidating the build dependencies
into a single graph. This minimizes the aggregate amount of work the
driver needs to perform and all but eliminates redundant operations.</p>
<p>Non-recursive make is typically achieved one of 2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a single monolithic make file</li>
<li>Concatenate all of your make files together (using the built-in
<em>include</em> directive)</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, you produce a single DAG and all is well. More on this
later.</p>
<h2>Transitioning to a Single DAG</h2>
<p>A big problem with non-recursive make is transitioning to it. For
projects like Firefox with its 1500 Makefiles, each existing in its own
little universe, this is a Herculean effort. There is a reason why
many (including Mozilla) haven't done it: it's just too hard.</p>
<p>The problem of slow build times with Firefox is important to me because
I suffer from it almost every day. So, I got to thinking of creative
ways to solve this problem. How can we work towards a monolithic DAG? How
can we do this incrementally so as to not cause too much disruption and
so the effort isn't near impossible?</p>
<p>I've come up with a plan that I believe Mozilla should pursue. The plan
consists of many different parts, each of which is described in a separate
section below. Each part is presented in roughly the order it needs to
be addressed in.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that <strong>this is my personal opinion and what I'm about
to propose is merely that: a proposal</strong>. For all I know, people will think
I'm smoking crack and none of these ideas will be pursued.</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<h2>Part 1: No Rules</h2>
<p>Make files consist of
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Introduction">rules</a>.
These are, well, rules that tell make how to evaluate a target. A rule
will say something like <em>to turn hello.cpp into hello.o, call the C++
compiler with these arguments</em>.</p>
<p>People naturally take advantage of the fact that the body of the rule
(the <em>recipe</em> in make parlance) is often similar for many targets, so
you make use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcards">wildcard rules</a>
or by specifying multiple prerequisites and/or targets for a rule.</p>
<p>Wildcard rules are great. Their problem is that the recipe is often
useful across many make files. The solution here is to put the rule
definition (and thus the recipe) in a common file and use make's
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">include directive</a>
to bring those rules into the current make file.</p>
<p>This is the general approach Mozilla takes. All of the generic rules are
defined in the (oh-it-hurts-my-eyes-to-look-at-so-much-make-syntax)
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/config/rules.mk">rules.mk</a>
file. Individual Makefiles in the tree simply define specifically-named
variables such as <em>CPPSRCS</em> or <em>XPIDLSRCS</em> and then include <em>rules.mk</em>.
When make executes, <em>rules.mk</em> transforms these variables into
rules which are automagically inserted into the DAG.</p>
<p>From a user perspective, this is splendid. You simply define some variables
and magic ensues. Instead of hairy looking make files, you literally
have a file with simple variable assignments. If all goes to plan, you
don't need to look at these rules definitions. Instead, you leave that
up to professional dragon trainers, such as Ted Mielczarek, Joey
Armstrong, and Kyle Huey.</p>
<p>A large problem is that many make files define custom rules - things not
using the magic from rules.mk. What's worse is that these custom rules
are often <em>cargo culted</em> around. They work, yes, but there is redundancy.
The installation of mochitest files is a perfect example of this.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=370750">Bug 370750</a>)
tracks establishing a rule for this
<a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=TEST_FILES">absurd repetition</a>
of make logic in Mozilla's tree. Even in the case of mochitest rules
where the recipe is simple (it's just calling <em>$(INSTALL)</em>), the lack of
a unified rule hurts us. If we wanted to change the directory the
mochitest files were installed to, this would require editing scores of
files. Not cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first step towards improving the Mozilla build system (and
any make file based build system really) is what I'm calling the <strong>no
rules initiative</strong>.</p>
<p>We should strive for no explicit rules in non-shared make files
(things outside of <em>config/</em> and <em>build/</em> in the Mozilla source tree -
basically all the files named <em>Makefile.in</em> or <em>Makefile</em>).
Instead, individual make files should define variables that cause rules
from a shared make file (like <em>rules.mk</em>) to be applied.</p>
<p>In Mozilla's case, this will be a lot of manual effort and it will seem
like there is no immediate gain. The benefits will be explained in
subsequent sections.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Eliminate Make File Content Not Related to Building</h2>
<p>Mozilla's make files are riddled with content that isn't directly
related to the action of building Mozilla applications. Not only does
this contribute to the overhead of invoking make (these bits need to be
evaluated when parsing, added to the DAG, etc, adding cost), but they
also make the make files harder to read and thus edit.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/testing/testsuite-targets.mk">testsuite-targets.mk</a>
is a good example of this. While it isn't included in every make file
(just the top-level one), the code isn't related to building at
all! Instead, it is essentially proxy code that maps make targets to
commands. It is supposed to be convenient: type |make xpcshell-tests|
and some tests run. OK, fine. I'll give you that.
The main problem is this make file is just a glorified shell script.
Make is great at constructing a dependency graph. As a DSL for shell
scripts, I'd rather just write a script. Therefore, I would argue code
like this belongs elsewhere - not in make files.</p>
<p>Anyway, a problem for Mozilla is that our make files are riddled with
pieces of content that aren't directly related to <em>building</em>. And, build
system maintainers pay the price. Every time you see some part of a make
file that doesn't appear to be directly related to the act of building,
your mind is like, "wut ist das?" (That's High German for <em>WTF?</em>) You
start asking questions. What's it for. Who uses it? Is it really needed?
What happens if it breaks? How will I know? These questions all need
answered and that adds overhead to editing these files. Oftentimes these
little one-off gems are undocumented and the questions are nearly
impossible to answer easily. The wise course of action is usually
<em>preserve existing behavior</em>. Nobody wants to melt someone else's
precious snowflake, after all. Thus, cargo cult programming prevails.</p>
<p>The solution I propose is along the same vein as the <em>no rules
initiative</em> - you can actually think of it as a specifically-tailored
subset: <em>limit the make files to what's necessary for building.</em> If it
doesn't relate to the act of building the application - if it is an
island in the DAG - remove it.</p>
<p>But where do you move it to? Good question. We don't have an obvious
location today. But, in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a> I am
creating what is essentially a frontend for the build system. That is
where it should go. (I will publish more information about that project
on this blog once it has landed.)</p>
<h2>Part 3: Make File Style Conventions and Enforced Review Requirements</h2>
<p>My first two points revolved around what is effectively a make file
style convention. If we are serious about making that convention stick,
we need to enforce it better.</p>
<p>This can be done in two ways.</p>
<p>First, we establish a review policy that any changes to make files must
be signed off by a build system peer. Maybe we carve out an exception
for simple cases, such as adding a file to a <em>XPIDLSRCS</em> variable. I
don't know. We certainly don't allow people to add new make files or
even targets without explicit sign-off. I <em>think</em> this is how it is
supposed to be today. It isn't enforced very well if it is.</p>
<p>To aid in enforcing the style convention, we arm people with a tool that
checks the style so they can fix things before it lands on a build
peer's plate. This is actually pretty trivial to implement (I even
have code that does this). The hard part is coming to consensus on the
rules. If there is a will, I can make this happen easily.</p>
<p>Once you have the tool to check for convention/style violations, your
checkin policy is amended to include: <em>no make file changes can be checked
in unless the file passes the style checker.</em> This is sure to draw ire
from some, I'm sure. But, the alternative is having a cat and mouse
game between the build system maintainers making the build system suck
less and other people undoing their work with new features, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, these rules wouldn't be absolute - there could always be
exceptions, of course. If we're serious about making the build system
better, we need it to be more consistent and have less variance. I'm
open to other suggestions to accomplish this.</p>
<h2>Part 4: Extracting Data from Make Files</h2>
<p>Once we have make files which consist of simple variable assignments (not
rules), it is possible to take the values of these variables, and extract
them from the make files to some higher-level system. For
example, we could scour all the make files for the <em>CPPSRCS</em> variable
and assemble a unified list of all C++ source files defined by that
variable across the entire build system. Then, we could do some really
interesting things.</p>
<p>What kind of things you ask? Well, one idea is you could write out a
monolithic make file that explicitly listed every target from the
extracted data. No recursive make necessary here! Another idea would
be to produce Visual Studio project files.</p>
<p>Think I'm crazy and this is impossible?
<a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/1363034/b3d956a66e049e7624fbdb79762551202fe9a465/optimized.mk">Feast your eyes</a>.
That make file was generated by parsing the existing Firefox make files,
extracting statically-defined data, then transforming that data
structure back into a single make file. I also have code somewhere that
produces Visual Studio projects.</p>
<p>Now, all of this is just a proof-of-concept. It works just well enough
for me to prove it is feasible. (The linked example is 7 months old and
won't work on the current tree.) Although, at one time, I did have have a
functioning transformation of essentially the <em>make export</em> stage. All
include files and IDL generation was in a single make file. It ran in a
fraction of the time as recursive make. A no-op execution of the
monolithic make file took about 0.5 seconds and - <em>gasp</em> - actually did
no work (unlike the no-op builds in the Mozilla tree today which
actually run many commands, even though nothing changed).</p>
<p>My point is that by having your make files - your build system - be
statically defined, you can extract and combine pieces of information.
Then, with relative ease, you can transform it to something else. Instead
of make files/build systems being a DSL for shell script execution, they
are data structures. And, you can do a lot more with data structures
(including generating shell scripts). Representing a build system as a
unified, constant data structure is what I consider to be the <em>holy grail</em>
of build systems. If you can do this, all you need to do is transform a
data structure to a format some other build tool can read and you are
set. If you do a good job designing your data structure, what you've
essentially built is an intermediate language (IR) that can be
compiled to different build tools (like make, Ninja, and Visual Studio).</p>
<p>(The previous paragraph is important. You may want to read it again.)</p>
<p>Getting back on point, our goal is to assemble aggregate data for
Mozilla's build system so we can construct a monolithic DAG. We can work
towards this by extracting variable values from our make files.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are technical problems with naive data extraction
from make files. Fortunately, I have solutions.</p>
<p>The first problem is getting at individual variable values in make
files. Simple parsing is ruled out, as make files can be more complex
than you realize (all those pesky built-in functions). You don't want
to burden people to add targets to print variable values and then
execute make just to print variables. This would be violating steps
1 and 2 from above! So, you somehow need to inject yourself into a
make execution context.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/pymake/">pymake</a>.
Pymake is a mostly feature complete implementation of GNU make written
in Python. You should be able to swap out GNU make for pymake and things
just work. If they don't, there is a bug in pymake.</p>
<p>pymake is useful because it provides an API for manipulating make and
make files. Contrast this was GNU make, which is essentially a black
box: make file goes in, process invocations come out. There's no really
good way to inspect things. The closest is the <em>-p</em> argument, which
dumps some metadata of the parsed file. But, this would require you to
parse that output. As they say, <em>now you have two problems</em>.</p>
<p>Using pymake, it's possible to get at the raw parser output and to poke
around the assembled data structures before the make file is evaluated.
This opens up some interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>With pymake's API, you can query for the value of a variable, such as
<em>XPIDLSRCS</em>. So, you just need to feed every make file into pymake,
query for the value of a variable, then do cool things with the
extracted data.</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>The problem with simple extraction of variables from make files is that
there is no guarantee of idempotence. You see, make files aren't static
structures. You don't parse a make file into a read-only structure,
build the DAG, and go. Oh no, because of how make files work, you have
to constantly re-evaluate things, possibly modifying the DAG in the
process.</p>
<p>When you obtain the value of a variable in make, you need to evaluate it.
In make parlance, this is called <em>expansion</em>.</p>
<p>Expansion is easy when variables have simple string content. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>CPPSRCS = foo.cpp bar.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>It gets more complicated when they have references to other variables:</p>
<pre><code>FILES = foo.cpp bar.cpp
CPPSRCS = $(FILES) other.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>Here the expansion of <em>CPPSRCS</em> must descend into <em>FILES</em> and expand
that. If <em>FILES</em> contained a reference, make would descend into that.
And so on.</p>
<p>The problem of non-guaranteed idempotence is introduced when variable
expansion interfaces with something that is non-deterministic, such as
the file system. This almost always involve a call to one of make's
built-in functions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>CPPSRCS = $(wildcard *.cpp)
SOURCES = $(shell find . -type f -name '*.cpp')
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the expanded value of <em>CPPSRCS</em> depends on the state of the
filesystem at the time of expansion. This is obviously not
deterministic. Since you can't guarantee the results of that expansion,
doing something with the evaluated value (such as generating a new
make file) is dangerous.</p>
<p>It gets worse.</p>
<p>The expansion of a variable can occur multiple times during the execution
of a make file due to deferred evaluation. When you use the <em>=</em> operator
in make files, the variable isn't actually expanded until it is accessed
(make just stores a reference to the string literal on the right
side of the assignment operator). Furthermore, the expansion occurs <em>every
time</em> the variable is accessed. Seriously.</p>
<p>The <em>:=</em> operator, however, expands the variable once - at assignment time.
Instead of storing a string reference, make evaluates that string
immediately and assigns the result to the variable.</p>
<p>The distinction is important and can have significant implications. Use
of <em>=</em> can lead to degraded performance via redundant work during multiple
expansions (e.g. file system access or shell invocation). It can also
cause the value of a variable to change during the course of execution
from changes to systems not directly under the make file's control (such
as the file system). For these reasons, <strong>I recommend to use the
immediate assignment operator (:=) instead of the deferred assignment
operator (=) unless you absolutely need deferred assignment</strong>. This is
because immediate assignment approximates what most think assignment
should be. Unfortunately, since <em>=</em> is the only assignment operator in the
overwhelming majority of popular programming languages, most people don't
even know that other assignment operators exist or that the deferred
assignment operator comes with baggage. Now you do. I hope you use it
properly.</p>
<p>Anyway, if a variable's value changes while a make file is executing, what
is the appropriate value to extract for external uses? In my opinion,
the safe answer is there is none: don't extract the value of that
variable. If you do, you are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>It sounds like I just tore a giant hole in my idea to extract simple
data from make files since I just said that the value may not be
deterministic. Correct. But, the key word here is <em>may</em>. Again, pymake
comes to the rescue.</p>
<p>Using pymake, I was able to implement a prover that guarantees whether a
variable is deterministic and thus idempotent. Basically, it examines
the statement list generated by pymake's parser. It traces the
assignment of a variable through the course of a statement list. If the
variable itself, any variable referenced inside of it, or any variable
that impacts the assignment (such as assignment inside a condition block)
is tainted by a non-deterministic evaluation (notably file system querying
and shell calls), that variable is marked as non-deterministic. Using
this prover, we can identify which variables are guaranteed to be
idempotent as long as the make file doesn't change. If you want to learn
more, see the
<a href="https://raw.github.com/indygreg/mozilla-central/build-splendid/build/buildsplendid/makefile.py">code</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a way of proving that a variable in a make file is
deterministic as long as the source make file doesn't change, we can
extract data from make files with confidence, without having to worry
about side-effects during execution of the make file. Essentially, the
only thing we need to monitor is the original make file and any make
files included by it. As long as they don't change, our static analysis
holds.</p>
<p>So, I've solved the technical problem of extracting data from make
files. This allows us to emancipate build system data into a constant
data structure. As mentioned above, this opens up a number of
possibilities.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that we can combine the prover with the style
enforcer from part 3 to help ensure Mozilla's make files are statically
defined. Over time, the make files will not only look like simple
variable assignments (from part 1), but will also become static data
structures. <strong>This will enable the Mozilla build system to be
represented as a single, constant data structure.</strong> This opens up the
transformation possibilities described above. It also allows for more
radical changes, such as replacing the make files with something else.
More on that later.</p>
<h2>Part 5: Rewriting Make Files</h2>
<p>Extracting data from make files to produce new build system data
(possibly a unified make file) introduces a new problem: redundancy
and/or fragmentation. You now have the original definition sitting
around in the original make file and an optimized version in a derived
file. What happens when the original file (still containing the original
values) is evaluated? Do you want the targets (now defined elsewhere from
the extracted data) to still work when executed from the original file?
(Probably not.)</p>
<p>There is also a concern for how to handle the partially converted build
system scenario. In theory, porting the build system to the <em>new world
order</em> would go something like this:</p>
<p>1) Identify a variable/feature you want to extract from the make files
2) Write routine to convert extracted data into an optimized builder
(maybe it just prints out a new make file)
3) For make files where that variable is defined but couldn't be safely
extracted (because it wasn't determinant), continue to execute the old,
inherited rule from <em>rules.mk</em> (as we do today).</p>
<p>This acknowledges the reality that any particular transition of a
variable to use an optimized build routine from extracted values will
likely be difficult to do atomically. The flag day will be held up by
stragglers. It would be much more convenient to accomplish the
transition incrementally. Files that are ready see the benefit today,
not only after everyone else is ready.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is make file rewriting. For variables that
are deterministic and have their functionality replaced by some other
system, we simply strip out references to these variables from the make
files. No variable. No inherited rule. No redundancy. No extra burden.
Of course, we're not altering the <em>original</em> make file. Instead,
we take the input make file (<em>Makefile.in</em> in the Mozilla tree), do
static analysis, remove variables handled elsewhere, then write out a
new make file.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this invented a new problem: rewriting make files. As far
as I can tell, nobody has done this before. At least not to the degree
or robustness that I have (previous solutions are effectively sed +
grep).</p>
<p>Using pymake, I was able to create an API sitting between the
parser and evaluator which allows high-level manipulation of the make
file data structure. Want to delete a variable? Go for it. Want to delete
a target? Sure! It's really the missing API from pymake (or any make
implementation for that matter). I stopped short of writing a
fully-featured API (things like adding rules, etc). Someday I would love
to fill that in because then you could create new/anonymous make
files/DAGS using just API calls. You would thus have a generic API for
creating and evaluating a DAG using make's semantics. This is
potentially very useful. For example, the optimized make files
generated from static data extracted from other make files I've been
talking about could be produced with this API. In my opinion, this
would be much cleaner than printing make directives by hand (which is
how I'm doing it today).</p>
<p>This new make file manipulation API was relatively easy to write. The hard
part was actually formatting the statement list back into a make file
that was both valid <strong>and</strong> functionally equivalent to the original.
(There's actually a lot of dark corners involving escaping, etc.) But, I
eventually slayed this dragon. And, the best part is I can prove it is
correct by feeding the output into the pymake parser and verifying the
two statement lists are identical! Furthermore, after the first
iteration (which doesn't preserve formatting of the original make file
because a) it doesn't need to and b) it would be a <em>lot</em> of effort) I can
even compare the generated string content of the make files as an added
sanity check.</p>
<p>If you are interested, the code for this lives alongside the
deterministic proving code linked to in the previous section. I would
like to land it as part of pymake someday. We'll see how receptive the
pymake maintainers are to my crazy ideas.</p>
<p>Anyway, we can now strip extracted variables handled by more efficient
build mechanisms out of generated make files. That's cool. It gives us an
incremental transition path for Mozilla's build system that bridges new
and old.</p>
<p>But wait - there's more!</p>
<p>That deterministic prover I wrote for data extraction: I can actually
use it for rewriting make files!</p>
<p>Make files support
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Conditionals">conditional directives</a>
such as <em>ifeq</em>, <em>ifneq</em>, <em>ifdef</em>, <em>else</em>, etc. For each conditional
directive, I can query the deterministic prover and ask whether an
expansion of that directive is deterministic. If it is, I evaluate the
conditional directive and determine which branch to take. And, I may
have invented the first make file optimizer!</p>
<p>I simply replace the condition block (and all the branches therein) with
the statements constituting the branch that is guaranteed to be
executed.</p>
<p>As a contrived example:</p>
<pre><code>DO_FOO := 1

ifeq ($(DO_FOO), 1)
foo.o: foo.cpp
    clang++ -o foo.o foo.cpp
endif
</code></pre>
<p>We can prove the <em>ifeq</em> branch will always be taken. So, using the
deterministic prover, we can rewrite this as:</p>
<pre><code>DO_FOO := 1

foo.o: foo.cpp
    clang++ -o foo.o foo.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, we can now see that the value of <em>DO_FOO</em> is not referenced
and is free from side-effects (like a shell call), and can eliminate it!</p>
<pre><code>foo.o: foo.cpp
    clang++ -o foo.o foo.cpp
</code></pre>
<p>Cool!</p>
<p>The practical implication of this is that it is shifting the burden of
make file evaluation from once every time you run make to <em>some time
before</em>. Put another way, we are reducing the amount of work make performs
when evaluating a make file. As long as the original file and any files
included by it don't change frequently, the cost of the static analysis
and rewriting is repaid by simpler make files and the lower run-time
cost they incur. This should translate to speedier make invocations.
(Although, I have no data to prove this.)</p>
<p>Another nice side-effect is that the rewritten and reduced make file is
easy to read. You know exactly what is going to happen without having to
perform the evaluation of (constant) conditional statements in your head
(which likely involves consulting other files, like <em>autoconf.mk</em> in the
case of Mozilla's make files). My subjective feeling is that this makes
generated make files much easier to understand.</p>
<p>So, not only does rewriting make files allow us to incrementally
transition to a build system where work is offloaded to a more optimized
execution model, but it also makes the evaluated make files smaller,
easier to understand, and hopefully faster. As Charlie Sheen would say:
winning!</p>
<h2>Review Through Part 5</h2>
<p>At this point, I've laid out effectively phase 1 of making Mozilla's
build system suck much less. We now have make files that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusing rule logic from rules.mk to do everything (specially-named
  variables cause magic to ensure). No cargo culted rules.</li>
<li>Devoid of cruft from targets not related to building the application.</li>
<li>Variables defined such that they are deterministic (essentially no
  shell and filesystem calls in make files)</li>
<li>A review system in place to ensure we don't deviate from the above</li>
<li>A higher-level tool to extract specific variables from make files
  which also produces an optimized, non-recursive make file to evaluate
  those targets. Ideally, this encompasses all rules inherited from
  rules.mk and the need for recursion and to evaluate individual make
  files is eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we wanted, we could stop here. This is about the limit we can take
the existing build system while maintaining some resemblence to the
current architecture.</p>
<p>But, I'm not done.</p>
<h2>Part 6: Transition Away from Make Files</h2>
<p>If we've implemented the previous parts of this post, it is only
natural for us to shift away from make files.</p>
<p>If all we have in our make files are variable assignments, why are we
using make files to define a static document? There are much better
formats for static data representation. YAML and JSON come to mind.</p>
<p>If we transition the build system definition to something actually
declarative - not just something we shoehorn into being declarative
(because that is how you make it fast and maintainable) - that cuts out
a lot of the hacky-feeling middleware described above (static analysis,
data extraction, and rewriting). It makes parsing simpler (no need for
pymake). It also takes away a foot gun (non-deterministic make
statements). Still not convinced? We could actually properly represent
an array (make doesn't have arrays, just strings split on whitespace)!
OK, just kidding - the array thing isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Anyway, the important characteristic of the build system is achieving
that <em>holy grail</em> where the entire thing can be represented as a single
generic (and preferably constant) data structure. As long as you can
arrive at that (a state that can be transformed into something else),
it doesn't matter the road you take. But, some roads are certainly
cleaner than others.</p>
<p>At the point where you are transitioning away from make files, I would
argue the correct thing to do is convert the build definition to files
understood by another build tool. Or, we should at least use a format
that is easily loaded into another tool. If we don't, we've just invented
a custom one-off build system. A project the size of Mozilla could
probably justify it. But, I think the right thing to do is find an open
source solution that fits the bill and run with that.</p>
<p>While I'm far from an expert on it, I'll throw out
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/gyp/">GYP</a> as a candidate. GYP defines the
build system in JSON files (which can actually be directly evaluated in
a Python interpreter). GYP consumes all of the individual .gyp/JSON
files and assembles an aggregate representation of the <em>entire</em> build
system. You then feed that representation into a generator, which
produces make files, Ninja files, or even Visual Studio or Xcode
project files. Sound familiar? It's essentially my <em>holy grail</em> where
you transform a data structure into something consumed by a specific
tool. I approve.</p>
<p>Now, GYP is not perfect. No build system is perfect. I will say
that GYP is good enough to build Chromium. And, if it can handle
Chromium, surely it can handle Firefox.</p>
<h2>Next Steps for Mozilla</h2>
<p>I'm not sure what the next steps are. I've been trying to convince
people for a while that a data-centric declarative build system is
optimal and we should be working towards it. Specifically, we should be
working towards a monolithic DAG, not separate DAGs in separate make
files. I think people generally agree with me here. We obviously have a
build system today that is very declarative (with variables turning into
rules). And, I know people like Joey Armstrong understand why recursive
make is so slow and are working on ways to switch away from it.</p>
<p>I think the main problem is people are overwhelmed by what a transition
plan would look like. There is a lot of crap in our make files and
fixing it all in one go is next to impossible. Nobody wants to do it
this way. And, I think the sheer scope of the overall problem along with
a constant stream of new features (Fennec make files, ARM support,
Windows 8, etc) has relegated people to merely chipping away at the
fringe.</p>
<p>Supplementing that, I think there has been doubt over some of what I've
proposed, specifically around the scarier-sounding bits like performing
static analysis and rewriting of make files. It scared me when I first
realized it was possible, too. But, it's possible. It's real. I have
code that does it. I'll admit the code is far from perfect. But, I've
done enough that I've convinced my self it is possible. It just needs a
little polish and everything I described above is a reality. We just
need to commit to it. Let's do it.</p>
<h2>Loose Ends</h2>
<h3>What About "Sand-boxed" Make or Concatenating Make Files?</h3>
<p>I anticipate that the main <em>competition</em> for my proposal will involve
the following approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>"sand-boxed" make files (described in the aforementioned <em>Recursive
   Make Considered Harmful</em> paper)</li>
<li>Concatenate all the make files together</li>
</ol>
<p>The concatenating one is definitely a non-controversial alternative to
my proposal of extracting data then creating derived build files
(possibly a monolithic make file) from it. And, if we go with
concatenating, I'll generally be happy. We'll have a mostly
statically-defined build system and it will exist in one monolithic DAG.
This has desirable attributes.</p>
<p>FWIW, the stalled
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=623617">bug 623617</a> has an
amazing patch from Joey Armstrong which partially implements concatenated
make files. If this lands, I will be extremely happy because it will make
the build system much faster and thus make developers' lives less
painful.</p>
<p>That being said, I do have a complaint against the concatenating
approach: it is still defined in make files.</p>
<p>The problem isn't make itself: it's that at the point you have pulled off
concatenating everything together, your build system is effectively static
data declarations. Why not use something like GYP instead? That way, you
get Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, or even make file generation
<strong>for free</strong>. I think it would be silly to ignore this opportunity.</p>
<p>If we continue to define everything in make files, we'll have to rely on
data extraction from the concatenated make file to create project files for
Visual Studio, Xcode, etc. This is possible (as I've proved above). And,
I will gladly lend my time to implementing solutions (I've already
performed a lot of work to get Visual Studio project generation working
in this manner, but I abandoned work because I reached the long tail that
is one-off targets and redundancy - which would be eliminated if we
accomplish parts 1 and 2). Furthermore, we may have to reinvent the
wheel of generating these project files (believe me, generating Visual
Studio projects is not fun). Or, we could find a way to extract
the make file data into something like GYP and have it do the generation
for us. But, if we are going to end up in GYP (or similar), why don't we
just start there?</p>
<p>I will also throw out that if we are really intent on preserving our
existing make rules, it would be possible to define the build system in
GYP/other files and write a custom GYP/other generator which
produced make files tailored for our existing make rules.</p>
<p>In summary, the crux of my argument against concatenated make files is
that it is a lot of work and that for roughly the same effort you could
produce something else which has almost identical properties but has
more features (which will make the end-developer experience better).</p>
<p>You could say the additional complexity of my proposal is just to buy us
Visual Studio, etc support. That is more or less accurate. I think I've
put in more time than anyone to devise a solution that programmatically
generates Visual Studio projects. (Manually tailored files out out of
the question because the maintenance of keeping them in sync with build
system changes would be too high and error prone.) From my perspective,
if we want to provide Visual Studio, Xcode, etc files for Mozilla
projects - if we want to provide developers access to amazing tools so
they can be more productive - we need the build system defined in
something <em>not make</em> so this is robust.</p>
<h3>Eclipse Project Files</h3>
<p>Jonathan Watt recently
<a href="https://jwatt.org/blog/2012/06/10/the-new-eclipse-cdt-and-mozilla-development">posted instructions</a>
on configuring Eclipse CDT to build Firefox. Awesome!</p>
<p>Some may say that debunks my theory that it is difficult/impossible to
generate build project files from just make files (without the sorcery I
describe above). Perhaps.</p>
<p>As cool as the Eclipse CDT integration is, the way it works is a giant
hack. And, I don't mean to belittle Jonathan or his work here - it is
very much appreciated and a large step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The Eclipse CDT integration works by scanning the output of make,
looking for compiler invocations. It parses these out, converting the
arguments to Eclipse project data. Not only do you have to perform a
standard make to configure Eclipse, but it also has to run without any
parallelization so as to not confuse the parser (interleaved output,
etc). And, Eclipse doesn't do everything for you - you still have to
manage part of your build from the command line.</p>
<p>So, Eclipse is really a hybrid solution - albeit a rather useful one
and, importantly, one that seems to work. Yet, In my opinion, this is
all a little fragile and less than ideal. I want the ability to build
the whole thing from your build tool. This <em>is</em> possible with the
solutions I've proposed above.</p>
<h3>Improving GYP</h3>
<p>Above, I recommended GYP as a build system which I think is a good
example of my <em>holy grail</em> build system - one which represents
everything as data and allows transformations to multiple build tools.</p>
<p>While I like the concept of GYP, there are parts of the implementation I
don't like. Every build system inevitably needs to deal with
conditionals. e.g. <em>if on Windows, use this flag; if on Linux, use this
one.</em> GYP represents conditions as specially crafted property names in
JSON objects. For example:</p>
<pre><code>{
  'conditions': [
    ['OS=="linux"', {
      'targets': [
        {
          'target_name': 'linux_target'
        },
      ],
    }],
    ['OS=="win"', {
      'targets': [
        {
          'target_name': 'windows_target',
        },
      ],
    }]
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>That special string as a key name really rubs me the wrong way. You are
using declarative data to represent procedural flow. Yuck. It reminds me
of a horror from a previous life - VXML. Don't ever try to write a
computer program complete with branching and functions in XML: you will
just hate yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway, despite the conflation of logic and data, it isn't too bad. As
long as you limit the expressions that can be performed (or that
actually are performed - I think I read they just feed it into eval),
it's still readable. And, I'll happily sacrifice some purity to achieve
the <em>holy grail</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think my optimal build system would look a lot like GYP except
that the data definition language would be a little more powerful.
Knowing that you will inevitably need to tackle conditionals and other
simple logic, I would give up and give my build system files access to a
real programming language. But, it would need to be a special language.
One that doesn't allow foot guns (so you can preserve determinism) and
one that can't be abused to allow people to stray too far from a
data-first model.</p>
<p>For this task, I would employ the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
programming language. I would use Lua because it is designed to be an
embeddable and easily sandboxed programming language. These attributes
are perfect for what I'd need it to do.</p>
<p>Basically, files defining the build system would be Lua scripts. Some
driver program would discover all these Lua files. It would create a new
Lua context (an instance of the Lua interpreter) for each file. The
context's global registry (namespace) would be populated
with variables that defined the existing build
configuration.  <em>IS_WINDOWS</em>, <em>HAVE_STRFTIME</em>, etc - the kind of stuff
<em>exported</em> by configure. The Lua script would get executed in that
context. It would do stuff. It would either set specially-named global
variables to certain values or it would call functions installed in the
global registry like <em>add_library</em>, etc. Then, the driving program would
collect everything the Lua script did and merge that into a data
structure representing the build system, achieving the <em>holy grail</em>.</p>
<p>In the simple case, build files/Lua scripts would just look like simple
variable assignments:</p>
<pre><code>EXPORTED_INCLUDES = {"foo.h", "bar.h"]
LIBRARY_NAME = "hello"
</code></pre>
<p>If the build system needed to do something conditional, you would have a
real programming language to fall back on:</p>
<pre><code>if IS_WINDOWS then
    SOURCE_FILES = "windows.cpp"
else
    SOURCE_FILES = "other.cpp"
end
</code></pre>
<p>To my eye, this is cleaner than hacking JSON while still readable.</p>
<p>For people not familiar with Lua, new context instances are cheap, tiny,
and have almost no features. Even the standard library must be
explicitly added to a context! Contrast this with a batteries-included
language like Python or JavaScript. So, while the build definition files
would have a fully-featured programming language backing them, they
would be severely crippled. I'm thinking I would load the <em>string</em> and
<em>table</em> libraries from the <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6">standard library</a>.
Maybe I'd throw the <em>math</em> one in too. If I did, I'd disable the random
function, because that's not deterministic!</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that would get me to a happy place. Maybe I'll get bored
on a weekend and implement it! I'm thinking I'll have a Python program
drive Lua through the ctypes module (if someone hasn't written a binding
already - I'm sure they have). Python will collect data from the Lua
scripts and then translate that to GYP data structures. If someone beats
me to it, please name it <em>Lancelot</em> and leave a comment linking to the
source.</p>
<h3>Using Code for Other Projects</h3>
<p>The code I wrote for pymake can be applied to any make file, not just
Mozilla's. I hope to have some of it integrated with the official pymake
repository some day. If this interests you, please drop me a line in the
comments and I'll see what I can do.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>On Twitter the other night, Justin Dolske
<a href="https://twitter.com/dolske/status/214241105179451393">posed a question</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Weekend challenge: what is the oldest line of code still shipping
in Firefox (tiebreaker: largest contiguous chunk)?
</code></pre>
<p>Good question and good challenge!</p>
<h2>Technical Approach</h2>
<p>To solve this problem, I decided my first task would be to produce a
database holding line-by-line metadata for files <em>currently</em> in the
Firefox repository. This sounded like a difficult problem at first,
especially considering the Mercurial repository doesn't contain CVS
history and this would be needed to identify code older than Mercurial
that is <em>still</em> active.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there exists a
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/">Git repository</a> with full
history of mozilla-central, including CVS and Mercurial! Armed with a
clone of this repository, I wrote a quick shell <em>one-liner</em> to ascertain
the history of every line in the repository:</p>
<pre><code>for f in `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD`; do \
  echo "BEGIN_RECORD $f"; \
  git blame -l -t -M -C -n -w -p $f; \
  echo "END_RECORD $f"; \
done
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>git ls-tree</em> command prints the names of every file in
the current tree. This is basically doing <em>find . -type f</em> except for
files under version control by Git. <em>git blame</em> attempts to ascertain
the history of each line in a file. It is worth pointing out arguments
<em>-M</em> and <em>-C</em>. These attempt to find moves/copies of the line from
within the same commit. If these are omitted, simple refactoring such as
renaming a file or reordering code within a file would result in a
improper commit attribution. Basically, Git would associate the line
with the commit that changed it. With these flags, Git attempts to
complete the chain and find the true origin of the line (to some
degree).</p>
<p>Now, something I thought was really cool is <em>git blame</em>'s porcelain
output format (<em>-p</em>). Not only does it allow for relatively simple machine
readability of the output (yay), but it also compacts the output
so adjacent lines sharing the same history metadata share the
same metadata/header block. In other words, it solves Dolske's <em>largest
contiguous chunk</em> tiebreaker for free! Thanks, Git!</p>
<p>I should also say that <em>git blame</em> isn't perfect for attributing code.
But I think it is good enough to solve a Twitter challenge.</p>
<p>I piped the output of the above command into a file so I could have the
original data available to process. After all, this data is idempotent,
so it makes no sense to <em>not</em> save it. After running for a while, I noticed
things were running slower than I'd like. I think it took about 2 hours
to obtain info for ~5000 files. No good. I played around a bit and
realized the <em>-M</em> and <em>-C</em> flags were slowing things down. This is
expected. But, I really wanted this data for a comprehensive data
analysis.</p>
<p>I re-discovered <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>
and modified my one-liner to use <strong>all the cores</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | \
parallel 'echo "BEGIN_RECORD {}"; git blame -l -t -M -C -n -w -p {}; echo "END_RECORD {}"'
</code></pre>
<p>This made things run <em>substantially</em> faster since I was now running on
all 8 cores, not just 1. With GNU Parallel, this simple kind of
parallelism is almost too easy. Now, I say <em>substantially</em> faster, but
overall execution is still slow. How slow? Well, on my Sandy Bridge Macbook
Pro:</p>
<pre><code>real  525m49.149s
user  3592m15.862s
sys   201m4.482s
</code></pre>
<p>8:45 wall time and nearly 60 hours of CPU time. Yeah, I'm surprised
my laptop didn't explode too! The output file was 1,099,071,448 bytes
uncompressed and 155,354,423 bzipped.</p>
<p>While Git was obtaining data, I set about writing a consumer and data
processor. I'm sure the wheel of parsing this <em>porcelain</em> output format
has been invented before. But, I hadn't coded any Perl in a while and
figured this was as good of an excuse as any!</p>
<p>The Perl script to do the parsing and data analysis is available at
<a href="https://gist.github.com/2945604">https://gist.github.com/2945604</a>.
The core parsing function simply calls a supplied callback whenever a
new <em>block</em> of code from the same commit/file is encountered.</p>
<p>I implemented a function that records a mapping of commit times to
blocks. Finally, I wrote a simple function to write the results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>What did 60 hours of CPU time tell us? Well, the oldest recorded line
dates from 1998-03-28. This is actually the <em>Free the Lizard</em> commit -
the first commit of open source Gecko to CVS. From this commit (Git
commit 781c48087175615674 for those playing at home), a number of lines
linger, including code for <em>mkdepend</em> and <em>nsinstall</em>.</p>
<p>But, Dolske's question was about <em>shipping</em> code. Well, as far as I can
tell, the oldest shipping code in the tree honor is shared by the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>js/jsd/jsd1640.rc (pretty much the whole file)</li>
<li>js/jsd/jsd3240.rc (ditto)</li>
<li>js/jsd/jsd_atom.c:47-73</li>
<li>js/src/jsfriendapi.cpp:388-400</li>
<li>js/src/yarr/YarrParser.h:295-523</li>
<li>media/libjpeg/jdarith.c:21-336</li>
<li>media/libjpeg/jctrans.c:20-178</li>
<li>media/libjpeg (misc files all have large blocks)</li>
<li>xpcom/components/nsComponentManager.cpp:897-901</li>
<li>gfx/src/nsTransform2D.h (a couple 3-4 line chunks)</li>
<li>toolkit/library/nsDllMain.cpp:22-31</li>
<li>widget/windows/nsUXThemeData.cpp:213-257</li>
<li>widget/windows/nsWindowGfx.cpp:756-815</li>
<li>xpcom/ds/nsUnicharBuffer.cpp:14-33</li>
<li>xpcom/glue/nsCRTGlue.cpp:128-174</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a few small chunks of 1 or 2 lines in a couple dozen
other files from that initial commit.</p>
<h2>Further Analysis</h2>
<p>If anyone is interested in performing additional analysis, you can just
take my Gist and install your own <em>onBlock</em> and output formatting
functions! Of course, you'll need a data set. My code is written so it
will work with any Git repository. If you want to analyze Firefox, it
will take hours of CPU time to extract the data from Git. To save some
time, you can obtain a copy of the raw data from commit
<a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~gszorc/mc-blame-0b961fb702a9576cb456.bz2">0b961fb702a9576cb456809410209adbbb956bc8</a>.</p>
<p>There is certainly no shortage of interesting analysis that
can be performed over this data set. Some that come to mind are a
<em>scoreboard</em> for most lines of code in the current tree (friendly
competition, anyone?) and a breakdown of active lines by the period they
were introduced.</p>
<p>I'll leave more advanced analysis as an exercise for the reader.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The other day I looked at a full Firefox build log from TBPL and noticed
that ~84,000 of the ~170,000 lines in the log I looked at was output
from archive processes. We were printing thousands of lines showing the
files that were being added and extracted from the archives that contain
test files!</p>
<p>I thought this was wasteful, so I filed
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757397">bug 757397</a> and
coded up a patch. Ted agreed that these lines were rather worthless and
the patch has landed in mozilla-inbound.</p>
<p>The result of the patch is build logs are about half as big in terms of
lines. And, it appears at least 500kb is shaved off the compressed log
files as well.</p>
<p>The real world impact is you should be able to load build logs from
the server faster because they are smaller.</p>
<p>If you were parsing this data before and are impacted by this, please
leave a comment on the aforementioned bug and we'll go from there.</p>
