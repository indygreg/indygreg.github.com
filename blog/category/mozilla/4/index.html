  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>There is a common practice at Mozilla for developing patches with
multiple parts. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think it's a best
practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller, self-contained patches are much easier to grok and
  review than larger patches.</li>
<li>Smaller patches can land as soon as they are reviewed. Larger patches
  tend to linger and get bit rotted.</li>
<li>Smaller patches contribute to a culture of being fast and nimble, not
  slow and lethargic. This helps with developer confidence, community
  contributions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some downsides to multiple, smaller patches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bigger picture is harder to understand until all parts of a
  logical patch series are shared. (This can be alleviated through
  commit messages or reviewer notes documenting future intentions.
  And of course reviewers can delay review until they are comfortable.)</li>
<li>There is more overhead to maintain the patches (rebasing, etc).
  IMO the solutions provided by Mercurial and Git are sufficient.</li>
<li>The process overhead for dealing with multiple patches and/or bugs
  can be non-trivial. (I would like to think good tooling coupled with
  continuous revisiting of policy decisions is sufficient to counteract
  this.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the prevailing practice at Mozilla seems to be that multiple
patches related to the same logical change are attached to the same
bug. I would like to challenge the effectiveness of this practice.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>An individual commit to Firefox should be standalone and should not
  rely on future commits to unbust it (i.e. bisects to any commit should
  be safe).</li>
<li>Bugzilla has no good mechanism to isolate review comments from
  multiple attachments on the same bug, making deciphering simultaneous
  reviews on multiple attachments difficult and frustrating. This leads
  to review comments inevitably falling through the cracks and the
  quality of code suffering.</li>
<li>Reiterating the last point because it's important.</li>
</ul>
<p>I therefore argue that attaching multiple reviews to a single Bugzilla
bug is not a best practice and it should be avoided if possible. If that
means filing separate bugs for each patch, so be it. That process can
be automated. Tools like
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/tmielczarek_mozilla.com/bzexport">bzexport</a>
already do it. Alternatively (and even better IMO), we ditch
Bugzilla's code review interface (Splinter) and integrate something like
<a href="https://reviewboard.allizom.org/">ReviewBoard</a> instead. We limit
Bugzilla to tracking, high-level discussion, and metadata aggregation.
Code review happens elsewhere, without all the clutter and chaos that
Bugzilla brings to the table.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <p>I have a number of Python projects and tools that interact with
various Mozilla services. I had authored clients for all these services
as standalone Python modules so they could be reused across projects.</p>
<p>I have consolidated all these Python modules into a unified source
control
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/python-mozautomation">repository</a>
and have made the project available on
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mozautomation">PyPI</a>. You can install it
by running:</p>
<p>$ pip install mozautomation</p>
<p>Currently included in the Python package are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client for <a href="https://treestatus.mozilla.org/">treestatus.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>Module for extracting cookies from Firefox profiles (useful for
  programmatically getting Bugzilla auth credentials).</li>
<li>A client for reading and interpretting the
  <a href="http://builddata.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildjson/">JSON dumps of automation jobs</a></li>
<li>An interface to a SQLite database to manage associations between
  Mercurial changesets, bugs, and pushes.</li>
<li>Rudimentary parsing of commit messages to extract bugs and reviewers.</li>
<li>A client to obtain information about Firefox releases via the
  <a href="http://releases-api.mozilla.org/">releases API</a></li>
<li>A module defining common Firefox source repositories, aliases, logical
  groups (e.g. twigs and integration trees), and APIs for fetching
  pushlog data.</li>
<li>A client for the <a href="https://secure.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildapi/self-serve/">self serve API</a></li>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The subject of where to host version control repositories comes up a lot
at Mozilla. It takes many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should move the Firefox repository to GitHub</li>
<li>I should be allowed to commit to GitHub</li>
<li>I want the canonical repository to be hosted by Bitbucket</li>
</ul>
<p>When Firefox development is concerned, Release Engineerings puts down
their foot and insists the canonical repository be hosted by Mozilla,
under a Mozilla hostname. When that's not possible, they set up a mirror
on Mozilla infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/-myjRIPcVwU/discussion">recent issue with the Jenkins project</a>
demonstrates why hosting your own version control server is important.
The gist is someone force pushed to a bunch of repos hosted on GitHub.
They needed to involve GitHub support to recover from the issue. While
it appears they largely recovered (and GitHub support deserves kudos - I
don't want to take away from their excellence), this problem would have
been avoided or the response time significantly decreased if the Jenkins
people had direct control over the Git server: they either could have
installed a custom hook that would have prevented the pushes or had
access to the reflog so they could have easily seen the last pushed
revision and easily forced pushed back to it. GitHub doesn't have a
mechanism for defining pre-* hooks, doesn't allow defining custom
hooks (a security and performance issue for them), and doesn't
expose the reflog data.</p>
<p>Until repository hosting services expose full repository data (such as
reflogs) and allow you to define custom hooks, accidents like these will
happen and the recovery time will be longer than if you hosted the repo
yourself.</p>
<p>It's possible repository hosting services like GitHub and Bitbucket will
expose these features or provide a means to quickly recover. If so,
kudos to them. But larger, more advanced projects will likely employ
custom hooks and considering custom hooks are a massive security and
performance issue for any hosted service provider, I'm not going to
hold my breath this particular feature is rolled out any time soon.
This is unfortunate, as it makes projects seemingly choose between
low risk/low convenience and GitHub's vibrant developer community.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_2.8_.282013-11-1.29">changes</a>
aren't as sexy as previous releases. But there are a handful of bug
fixes that seem useful to pull in. People may also find the new <em>shelve</em>

<p>I encourage Mozillians to keep their Mercurial up to date. I once went
around the San Francisco office and stood behind people as they
upgraded to a modern Mercurial. For the next few weeks I was hearing a
lot of "OMG Mercurial is so much better now." Don't handicap yourself by
running an older, buggy Mercurial.</p>
<p>If you don't yet feel comfortable running 2.8, 2.7 should be safe.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have updated my
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/mozext">Mercurial extension tailored for Gecko/Firefox development</a>
with features that support rich querying of Mozilla/Gecko-development
specific metadata!</p>
<p>The extension now comes with a bug full of
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/revsets">revision set</a> selectors and
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/templates">template keywords</a>. You can
use them to query and format Mozilla-central metadata from the
repository.</p>
<h2>Revision set selectors</h2>
<p>You can now select changesets referencing a specific bug number:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'bug(931383)'
</code></pre>
<p>Or that were reviewed by a specific person:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'reviewer(gps)'
</code></pre>
<p>Or were reviewed or not reviewed:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'reviewed()'
hg log -r 'not reviewed()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can now select changesets that are present in a specific tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'tree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>I've also introduced support to query changesets <em>you</em> influenced:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'me()'
</code></pre>
<p>(This finds changesets you authored or reviewed.)</p>
<p>You can select changesets that initially landed on a specific tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'firstpushtree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets marked as <em>DONTBUILD</em>:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'dontbuild()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets that don't reference a bug:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'nobug()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets that were <em>push heads</em> for a tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'pushhead(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>(This would form the basis of a push-aware bisection tool - an excellent
idea for a future feature in this extension.)</p>
<p>You can combine these revset selector functions with other revset
selectors to do some pretty powerful things.</p>
<p>To select all changesets on inbound but not central:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'tree(inbound) - tree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all your contributions on beta but not release:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'me() &amp; (tree(beta) - tree(release))'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all changesets referencing a specific bug that have landed in
Aurora:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'bug(931383) and tree(aurora)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all changesets marked <em>DONTBUILD</em> that landed directly on central:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'dontbuild() and firstpushtree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all non-merge changesets that don't reference a bug:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'not merge() and nobug()'
</code></pre>
<p>Neato!</p>
<h2>Template keywords</h2>
<p>You can also now print some Mozilla information when using templates.</p>
<p>To print the main bug of a changeset, use:</p>
<pre><code>{bug}
</code></pre>
<p>To retrieve all referenced bugs:</p>
<pre><code>{bugs} {join(bugs, ', ')}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the reviewers:</p>
<pre><code>{reviewer} {join(reviewers, ', ')}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the first version a changeset appeared in a specific channel:</p>
<pre><code>{firstrelease} {firstbeta} {firstaurora} {firstnightly}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the <strong>estimated</strong> first Aurora and Nightly date for a
changeset, use:</p>
<pre><code>{auroradate} {nightlydate}
</code></pre>
<p>(Getting the exact first Aurora and Nightly dates requires consulting
3rd party services, which we don't currently do. I'd like to
eventually integrate these into the extension. For now, it just
estimates dates from the pushlog data.)</p>
<p>You can also print who and where pushed a changeset:</p>
<pre><code>{firstpushuser} {firstpushtree}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also print the TBPL URL with the results of the first push:</p>
<pre><code>{firstpushtbpl}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example that prints channel versions and dates for each
changesets:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{rev} Nightly: {firstnightly} {nightlydate}; Aurora {firstaurora} {auroradate}; Beta: {firstbeta}; Release: {firstrelease}\n'
</code></pre>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Of course, you can combine selectors and templates to create some
mighty powerful queries.</p>
<p>To look at your impact on Mozilla, do something like:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{rev} Bug {bug}; Release {firstrelease}\n' -r 'me()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily forumate a status report for your activity in the past
week:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{firstline(desc)}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-7) and me()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can also query Mercurial to see where changesets have been landing
in the past 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{firstpushtree}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-30)' | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre>
<p>You can see who has been reviewing lots of patches lately:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{join(reviewers, "\n")}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-30)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>
<p>(smaug currently has the top score, edging out my 116 reviews with 137.)</p>
<p>If you want to reuse templates (instead of having to type them on the
command line), you can save them as <em>style files</em>. Search
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mercurial+style+files">the Internets</a>
to learn how to use them. You can even change your default style so
the default output from <em>hg log</em> contains everything you'd ever want to
know about a changeset!</p>
<h2>Keeping it running</h2>
<p>Many of the queries rely on data derived from multiple repositories and
pushlog data that is external to the repository.</p>
<p>To get best results, you'll need to be running a monolithic/unified
Mercurial repository. You can either assemble one locally with this
extension by periodically pulling from the separate repos:</p>
<pre><code>hg pull releases
hg pull integration
</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can pull from
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko">my personal unified repo</a>.</p>
<p>You will also need to ensure the pushlog data is current. If you pull
directly from the official repos, this will happen automatically. To be
sure, run:</p>
<pre><code>hg pushlogsync
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can force a repopulation of cached bug data by running:</p>
<pre><code>hg buginfo --reset
</code></pre>
<p>Over time, I want all this to automagically work. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Comments and future improvements</h2>
<p>I implemented this feature to save myself from having to go troving
through Bugzilla and repository history to answer questions and to
obtain metrics. I can now answer many questions via simple Mercurial
one-liners.</p>
<p>Custom revision set selectors and template keywords are a pretty nifty
feature of Mercurial. They demonstrate how you can extend Mercurial to
be aware of more than just tracking commits and files. As I've
<a href="/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercurial-%28and-git%29/">said before</a>
and will continue to say, the extensibility of Mercurial is
really its killer feature, especially for organizations with
well-defined processes (like Mozilla). The kind of extensibility I
achieved with this extension with custom queries and formatting
functions is just not possible with Git (at least not with the reference
C implementation that the overwhelming majority of Git users use).</p>
<p>There are numerous improvements that can be made to the extension.
Obviously more revision set selectors and template keywords can be
added. The parsing routine to extract bugs and reviewers isn't the most
robust in the world. I copied some existing Mozilla code. It does well
at detecting string patters but doesn't cope well with extracting lists.</p>
<p>I'd also love to better integrate Mercurial with automation
results so you can do things like expose a <em>greenpush()</em> selector and do
things like <em>hg up -r 'last(tree(inbound)) and greenpush()'</em> (which
of course could be exposed as <em>lastgreen(inbound)</em>. Wouldn't
that be cool! (This would be possible if we had better APIs for querying
individual push results.) It would also be possible to have the
Mercurial server expose this data as repository data so clients pull it
automatically. That would prevent clients from all needing to query the
same 3rd party services. Just a crazy thought.</p>
<p>Speed can be an issue. Calculating the release information
(<em>{firstnightly}</em> etc) is currently slower than I'd like. This is mostly
due to me using inefficient algorithms and not caching things where I
should. Speed issues should be fixed in due time.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you run into any problems or have suggestions for
improvements. If you want to implement your own revision set selectors
or template keywords, it's <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/hgext-gecko-dev/file/35bb3c96d786/__init__.py#l705">easier</a>
than you think! I will happily accept patches. Keep in mind that
Mercurial can integrate with 3rd party services. So if you want to
supplement repository data with data from a HTTP+JSON web service,
that's very doable. The sky is the limit.</p>
