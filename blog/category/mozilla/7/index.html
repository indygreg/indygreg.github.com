  <p>As of a few minutes ago, we explicitly dropped support for Mercurial 3.0
for all the Mercurial code in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository. File issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1162304">bug 1162304</a>.</p>
<p>Code may still work against Mercurial 3.0. But it isn't supported and
could break hard at any time.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple versions of <em>any</em> software carries
with it some cost. The people writing tooling around Mercurial are busy.
It is a waste of our time to bend over backwards to support old versions
of software that <strong>all</strong> users should have upgraded from months ago.
Still using older Mercurial versions means you aren't getting the best
performance and may encounter bugs that have since been fixed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mozilla tailored Mercurial installation instructions</a>

  <p>I semi-frequently stumble upon conversations in hallways and
on irc.mozilla.org about issues people are having with Mercurial.
These conversations periodically involve a legitimate bug with
Mercurial. Unfortunately, these conversations frequently end
without an actionable result. Unless someone files a bug, pings me,
etc, the complaints disappear into ether. That's not good for
anyone and only results in bugs living longer than they should.</p>
<p>There are posters around Mozilla offices that say
<em>if you see something, file something.</em> This advice does not just
apply to Mozilla projects!</p>
<p><strong>If you encounter an issue in Mercurial, please take the time
to report it somewhere meaningful.</strong> The
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/issues.html">Reporting Issues with Mercurial</a>
page from the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/index.html">Mercurial for Mozillians</a>
guide tells you how to do this.</p>
<p>It is OK to complain about something. But if you don't inform
someone empowered to do something about it, you are part of the
problem without being part of the solution. Please make the
incremental effort to be part of the solution.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.4 was released on May 1 (following Mercurial's time-based
schedule of releasing a new version every 3 months).</p>
<p>3.4 is a significant release for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the next version of the wire protocol (<em>bundle2</em>) has been
marked as non-experimental on servers. This version of the protocol
paves over a number of deficiencies in the classic protocol. I won't
go into low-level details. But I will say that the protocol enables
some rich end-user experiences, such as having the server hand out URLs
for pre-generated bundles (e.g. offload clones to S3), atomic push
operations, and advanced workflows, such as having the server rebase
automatically on push. Of course, you'll need a server running 3.4
to realize the benefits of the new protocol. hg.mozilla.org won't be
updated until at least June 1.</p>
<p>Second, Mercurial 3.4 contains improvements to the tags cache to make
performance concerns a thing of the past. Due to the structure of the
Firefox repositories, the previous implementation of the tags cache
could result in pauses of dozens of seconds during certain workflows.
The problem should go away with Mercurial 3.4. <strong>Please note that on
first use of Mercurial 3.4, your repository may perform a one-time
upgrade of the tags cache. This will spin a full CPU core and will
take up to a few minutes to complete on Firefox repos. Let it run to
completion and performance should not be an issue again.</strong> I wrote the
patches to change the tags cache (with lots of help from Pierre-Yves
David, a Mercurial core contributor). So if you find anything wrong,
I'm the one to complain to.</p>
<p>Third, the HTTP interface to Mercurial (hgweb) now has JSON output
for nearly every endpoint. The implementation isn't yet complete,
but it is better than nothing. But, it should be good enough for
services to start consuming it. Again, this won't be available on
hg.mozilla.org until the server is upgraded on June 1 at the earliest.
This is a feature I added to core Mercurial. If you have feature
requests, send them my way.</p>
<p>Fourth, a number of performance regressions introduced in Mercurial
3.3 were addressed. These performance issues frequently manifested
during <em>hg blame</em> operations. Many Mozillians noticed them on
hg.mozilla.org when looking at blame through the web interface.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive list of changes, see
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.version-control/z4aWvBoAGYw/d0hUGKJU_psJ">my post about the 3.4 RC</a>
and the
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_3.4_.282015-05-01.29">official release notes</a>.</p>
<p>3.4 was a significant release. There are compelling reasons to upgrade.
That being said, there were a lot of changes in 3.4. If you want to wait
until 3.4.1 is released (scheduled for June 1) so you don't run into
any regressions, nobody can fault you for that.</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, I recommend reading the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mercurial for Mozillians Installation Page</a>.</p>

  <p>Managing URLs in distributed version control tools can be a pain,
especially if multiple repositories are involved. For example,
with Mozilla's repository-based code review workflow (you push to a
special review repository to initiate code review - this is conceptually
similar to GitHub pull requests), there exist
<a href="https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/">separate code review repositories</a>
for each logical repository. Figuring out how repositories map to each
other and setting up remote paths for each new clone can be a pain and
time sink.</p>
<p>As of today, we can now do something better.</p>
<p>If you push to <em>ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/autoreview</em>,
Mercurial will automatically figure out the appropriate review
repository and redirect your push automatically. In other words, if we
have <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> set up to review
whatever repository you are working on,
your push and review request will automatically go through. No need to
figure out what the appropriate review repo is or configure
repository URLs!</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg push review

</pre></div>

<p>Read the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install.html#review-repositories">full instructions</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>This requires an updated <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository, which you can get by running <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> from a
Firefox repository.</p>
<p>For those that are curious, the <em>autoreview</em> repo/server advertises a list
of repository URLs and their root commit SHA-1. The client automatically
sends the push to a URL sharing the same root commit. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/rev/0b02cd388590">code</a>
is quite simple.</p>
<p>While this is only implemented for MozReview, I could envision us doing
something similar for other centralized repository-centric services, such
as <em>Try</em> and <em>Autoland</em>. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I attended PyCon last week. It's a great conference. You should attend.
While I should write up a detailed trip report, I wanted to quickly
share one of my takeaways.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> was talked about a lot at PyCon.
Sitting through a few presentations and talking with others helped me
articulate why I've been drawn to Ansible (over say Puppet, Chef, Salt,
etc) lately.</p>
<p>First, Ansible doesn't require a central server. Administration is done
remotely Ansible establishes a SSH connection to a remote machine and
does stuff. Having Ruby, Python, support libraries, etc installed on
production systems just for system administration never really jived
with me. I love Ansible's default hands off approach. (Yes, you can use
a central server for Ansible, but that's not the default behavior. While
tools like Puppet could be used without a central server, it felt like
they were optimized for central server use and thus local mode felt
awkward.)</p>
<p>Related to central servers, I never liked how that model consists of
clients periodically polling for and applying updates. I like the idea
of immutable server images and periodic updates work against this goal.
The central model also has a major bazooka pointed at you: at any time, you
are only one mistake away from completely hosing every machine doing
continuous polling. e.g. if you accidentally update firewall configs and
lock out central server and SSH connectivity, every machine will pick up
these changes during periodic polling and by the time anyone realizes
what's happened, your machines are all effectively bricked. (Yes, I've
seen this happen.) I like having humans control exactly when my systems
apply changes, thank you. I concede periodic updates and central control
have some benefits.</p>
<p>Choosing not to use a central server by default means that hosts are
modeled as a set of applied Ansible playbooks, not necessarily as a host
with a set of Ansible playbooks attached. Although, Ansible does support
both models. I can easily apply a playbook to a host in a one-off
manner. This means I can have playbooks represent common, one-off tasks
and I can easily run these tasks without having to muck around with the
host to playbook configuration. More on this later.</p>
<p>I love the simplicity of Ansible's configuration. It is just YAML files.
Not some Ruby-inspired DSL that takes hours to learn. With Ansible, I'm
learning what modules are available and how they work, not complicated
syntax. Yes, there is complexity in Ansible's configuration. But at
least I'm not trying to figure out the file syntax as part of learning
it.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I appreciate the readability of Ansible playbooks.
They are simple, linear lists of tasks. Conceptually, I love the promise
of full dependency graphs and concurrent execution. But I've spent hours
debugging race conditions and cyclic dependencies in Puppet that I'm left
unconvinced the complexity and power is worth it. I do wish Ansible
could run faster by running things concurrently. But I think they made
the right decision by following KISS.</p>
<p>I enjoy how Ansible playbooks are effectively high-level scripts. If I
have a shell script or block of code, I can usually port it to Ansible
pretty easily. One pass to do the conversion 1:1. Another pass to
Ansibilize it. Simple.</p>
<p>I love how Ansible playbooks can be checked in to source control and
live next to the code and applications they manage. I frequently see
people maintain separate source control repositories for configuration
management from the code it is managing. This always bothered me. When I
write a service, I want the code for deploying and managing that service
to live next to it in version control. That way, I get the configuration
management and the code versioned in the same timeline. If I check out a
release from 2 years ago, I should still be able to use its exact
configuration management code. This becomes difficult to impossible when
your organization is maintaining configuration management code in a
separate repository where a central server is required to do
deployments (see Puppet).</p>
<p>Before PyCon, I was having an internal monolog about adopting the policy
that all changes to remote servers be implemented with Ansible
playbooks. I'm pleased to report that a fellow contributor to the
Mercurial project has adopted this workflow himself and he only has
great things to say! So, starting today, I'm going to try to enforce
that every change I make to a remote server is performed via Ansible and
that the Ansible playbooks are checked into version control. The Ansible
playbooks will become implicit documentation of every process involved
with maintaining a server.</p>
<p>I've already applied this principle to deploying MozReview. Before,
there was some internal Mozilla wiki documenting commands to execute in
a terminal to deploy MozReview. I have replaced that documentation with
a one-liner that invokes Ansible. And, the Ansible files are now
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/1e85a23c4175/ansible">in a public repository</a>.</p>
<p>If you poke around that repository, you'll see that I have Ansible
playbooks referencing Docker. I have Ansible provisioning Docker images
used by the test and development environment. That same Ansible code
is used to configure our production systems (or is at least in the
process of being used in that way). Having dev, test, and prod using the
same configuration management has been a pipe dream of mine and I
finally achieved it! I attempted this before with Puppet but was unable
to make it work just right. The flexibility that Ansible's design
decisions have enabled has made this finally possible.</p>
<p>Ansible is my go to system management tool right now. And I still feel
like I have a lot to learn about its hidden powers.</p>
<p>If you are still using Puppet, Chef, or other tools invented in previous
generations, I urge you to check out Ansible. I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.</p>
