  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>After almost seven and a half years as an employee of Mozilla Corporation,
I'm moving on. I have already worked my final day as an employee.</p>
<p>This post is the first time that I've publicly acknowledged my departure.
To any Mozillians reading this, I regret that I did not send out a
farewell email before I left. But the circumstances of my departure weren't
conducive to doing so. I've been drafting a proper farewell blog post. But
it has been very challenging to compose. Furthermore, each passing day
brings with it new insights into my time at Mozilla and a new wrinkle to
integrate into the reflective story I want to tell in that post. I vow to
eventually publish a proper goodbye that serves as the bookend to my
employment at Mozilla. Until then, just let me say that I'm already missing
working with many of you. I've connected with several people since I left
and still owe responses or messages to many more. If you want to get in
touch, my contact info is in my <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>
<p>I left Mozilla without new employment lined up. That leads me to the
subject line of this post: I'm seeking employment. The remainder of this
post is thus tailored to potential employers.</p>
<p>My <a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a> has been updated. But that two page summary
only scratches the surface of my experience and set of skills. The
<a href="/work.html">Body of Work</a> page of my website is a more detailed record
of the work I've done. But even it is not complete!</p>
<p>Perusing through my posts on this blog will reveal even more about the
work I've done and how I go about it. My résumé links to a few posts
that I think are great examples of the level of understanding and detail
that I'm capable of harnessing.</p>
<p>As far as the kind of work I want to do or the type of company I want
to work for, I'm trying to keep an open mind. But I do have some biases.</p>
<p>I prefer established companies to early start-ups for various reasons.
Dan Luu's <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">Big companies v. startups</a>
is aligned pretty well with my thinking.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I worked for Mozilla was because of my personal
alignment with the
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>. So
I gravitate towards employers that share those principles and am
somewhat turned off by those that counteract them. But I recognize that
the world is complex and that competing perspectives aren't intrinsically
evil. In other words, I try to maintain an open mind.</p>
<p>I'm attracted to employers that align their business with improving the
well-being of the planet, especially the people on it. The link
between the business and well-being can be tenuous: a B2B business for
example is presumably selling something that helps people, and that helping
is what matters to me. The tighter the link between the business and
improving the world will increase my attraction to a employer.</p>
<p>I started my university education as a biomedical engineer because I
liked the idea of being at the intersection of technology and medicine.
And part of me really wants to return to this space because there
are few things more noble than helping a fellow human being in need.</p>
<p>As for the kind of role or technical work I want to do, I could go in
any number of directions. I still enjoy doing individual contributor type
work and believe I could be an asset to an employer doing that work. But
I also crave working on a team, performing technical mentorship, and being
a leader of technical components. I enjoy participating in high-level
planning as well as implementing the low-level aspects. I recognize that
while my individual output can be substantial (I can provide data showing
that I was one of the most prolific technical contributors at Mozilla
during my time there) I can be more valuable to an employer when I
bestow skills and knowledge unto others through teaching, mentorship,
setting an example, etc.</p>
<p>I have what I would consider expertise in a few domains that may be
attractive to employers.</p>
<p>I was a technical maintainer of Firefox's build system and initiated a
transition away from an architecture that had been in place since the
Netscape days. I definitely geek out way too much on build systems.</p>
<p>I am a contributor to the Mercurial version control tool. I know way
too much about the internals of Mercurial, Git, and other version
control tools. I am intimately aware of scaling problems with these
tools. Some of the scaling work I did for Mercurial saved Mozilla tens
of thousands of dollars in direct operational costs and probably
hundreds of thousands of dollars in saved people time due to fewer
service disruptions and faster operations.</p>
<p>I have exposure to both client and server side work and the problems
encountered within each domain. I've dabbled in lots of technologies,
operating systems, and tools. I'm not afraid to learn something new.
Although as my experience increases, so does my skepticism of shiny
new things (I've been burned by technical fads too many times).</p>
<p>I have a keen fascination with optimization and scaling, whether it
be on a technical level or in terms of workflows and human behavior.
I like to ask <em>and then what</em> so I'm thinking a few steps out and am
prepared for the next problem or consequence of an immediate action.</p>
<p>I seem to have a knack for caring about user experience and interfaces.
(Although my own visual design skills aren't the greatest - see my
website design for proof.) I'm pretty passionate that tools that people
use should be simple and usable. Cognitive dissonance, latency, and
distractions are real and as an industry we don't do a great job
minimizing these disruptions so focus and productivity can be
maximized. I'm not saying I would be a good product manager or
UI designer. But it's something I've thought about because not many
engineers seem to exhibit the passion for good user experience that
I do and that intersection of skills could be valuable.</p>
<p>My favorite time at Mozilla was when I was working on a unified
<em>engineering productivity</em> team. The team controlled most of the tools
and infrastructure that Firefox developers interacted with in order
to do their jobs. I absolutely loved taking a whole-world view of
that problem space and identifying the high-level problems - and
low-hanging fruit - to improve the overall Firefox development
experience. I derived a lot of satisfaction from identifying pain
points, equating them to a dollar cost by extrapolating people time
wasted due to them, justifying working on them, and finally
celebrating - along with the overall engineering team - when improvements
were made. I think I would be a tremendous asset to a company working
in this space. And if my experience at Mozilla is any indicator, I
would more than offset my total employment cost by doing this kind
of work.</p>
<p>I've been entertaining the idea of contracting for a while before
I resume full-time employment with a single employer. However, I've
never contracted before and need to do some homework before I commit
to that. (Please leave a comment or email me if you have recommendations
on reading material.)</p>
<p>My dream contract gig would likely be to finish the Mercurial wire
protocol and storage work I started last year. I would need to type
up a formal proposal, but the gist of it is the work I started has the
potential to leapfrog Git in terms of both client-side and server-side
performance and scalability. Mercurial would be able to open Git
repositories on the local filesystem as well as consume them via the
Git wire protocol. Transparent Git interoperability would enable
Mercurial to be used as a drop-in replacement for Git, which would
benefit users who don't have control over the server (such as projects
that live on GitHub). Mercurial's new wire protocol is designed with
global scalability and distribution in mind. The goal is to enable
server operators to deploy scalable VCS servers in a turn-key manner
by relying on scalable key-value stores and content distribution
networks as much as possible (Mercurial and Git today require servers
to perform way too much work and aren't designed with modern distributed
systems best practices, which is why scaling them is hard). The new
protocol is being designed such that a <em>Mercurial</em> server could expose
Git data. It would then be possible to teach a Git client to speak the
<em>Mercurial</em> wire protocol, which would result in Mercurial being a more
scalable Git server than Git is today. If my vision is achieved, this
would make server-side VCS scaling problems go away and would eliminate
the religious debate between Git and Mercurial (the answer would be
<em>deploy a Mercurial server, allow data to be exposed to Git, and let
consumers choose</em>). I conservatively estimate that the benefits to
industry would be in the millions of dollars. How I would structure
a contract to deliver aspects of this, I'm not sure. But if you are
willing to invest six figures towards this bet, let's talk. A good
foundation of this work is already implemented in Mercurial and the
Mercurial core development team is already on-board with many aspects
of the vision, so I'm not spewing vapor.</p>
<p>Another potential contract opportunity would be funding
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/category/pyoxidizer/">PyOxidizer</a>.
I started the project a few months back as a side-project as an
excuse to learn Rust while solving a <em>fun</em> problem that I thought
needed solving. I was hoping for the project to be useful for
Mercurial and Mozilla one day. But if social media activity is any
indication, there seems to be somewhat widespread interest in this
project. I have no doubt that once complete, companies will be using
PyOxidizer to ship products that generate revenue and that PyOxidizer
will save them engineering resources. I'd very much like to recapture
some of that value into my pockets, if possible. Again, I'm somewhat
naive about how to write contracts since I've never contracted, but I
imagine <em>deliver a tool that allows me to ship product X as a
standalone binary to platforms Y and Z</em> is definitely something that
could be structured as a contract. </p>
<p>As for the timeline, I was at Mozilla for what feels like an eternity
in Silicon Valley. And Mozilla's way of working is substantially
different from many companies. I need some time to decompress and
unlearn some Mozilla habits. My future employer will inherit a happier
and more productive employee by allowing me to take some much-needed
time off.</p>
<p>I'm looking to resume full-time work no sooner than March 1. I'd like
to figure out what the next step in my career is by the end of January.
Then I can sign some papers, pack up my skiis, and become a ski bum
for the month of February: if I don't use this unemployment opportunity
to have at least 20 days on the slopes this season and visit some new
mountains, I will be very disappointed in myself!</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch, my contact info is in my
<a href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>. I tend not to answer incoming calls from
unknown numbers, so email is preferred. But if you leave a voicemail,
I'll try to get back to you.</p>
<p>I look forward to working for a great engineering organization in the
near future!</p>

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Every so often a tool you use introduces a feature that is so useful
that you can't imagine how things were before that feature existed.
The recent 4.8 release of the
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial version control tool</a> introduces
such a feature: the <code>hg absorb</code> command.</p>
<p><code>hg absorb</code> is a mechanism to automatically and intelligently incorporate
uncommitted changes into prior commits. Think of it as <em><code>hg histedit</code> or
<code>git rebase -i</code> with auto squashing</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a set of changes to prior commits in your working
directory. <code>hg absorb</code> figures out which changes map to which commits
and <em>absorbs</em> each of those changes into the appropriate commit. Using
<code>hg absorb</code>, you can replace cumbersome and often merge conflict ridden
history editing workflows with a single command that often <em>just works</em>.
Read on for more details and examples.</p>
<p>Modern version control workflows often entail having multiple <em>unlanded</em>
commits in flight. What this looks like varies heavily by the version
control tool, standards and review workflows employed by the specific
project/repository, and personal preferences.</p>
<p>A workflow practiced by a lot of projects is to author your commits
into a sequence of standalone commits, with each commit representing
a discrete, logical unit of work. Each commit is then
reviewed/evaluated/tested on its own as part of a larger series.
(This workflow is practiced by Firefox, the Git and Mercurial projects,
and the Linux Kernel to name a few.)</p>
<p>A common task that arises when working with such a workflow is the need
to incorporate changes into an old commit. For example, let's say we have
a stack of the following commits:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg show stack
  @  1c114a ansible/hg-web: serve static files as immutable content
  o  d2cf48 ansible/hg-web: synchronize templates earlier
  o  c29f28 ansible/hg-web: convert hgrc to a template
  o  166549 ansible/hg-web: tell hgweb that static files are in /static/
  o  d46d6a ansible/hg-web: serve static template files from httpd
  o  37fdad testing: only print when in verbose mode
 /   (stack base)
o  e44c2e (@) testing: install Mercurial 4.8 final
</code></pre>
<p>Contained within this stack are 5 commits changing the way that static
files are served by hg.mozilla.org (but that's not important).</p>
<p>Let's say I submit this stack of commits for review. The reviewer spots
a problem with the second commit (<em>serve static template files from httpd</em>)
and wants me to make a change.</p>
<p>How do you go about making that change?</p>
<p>Again, this depends on the exact tool and workflow you are using.</p>
<p>A common workflow is to not rewrite the existing commits at all: you simply
create a new <em>fixup</em> commit on top of the stack, leaving the existing commits
as-is. e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg show stack
  o  deadad fix typo in httpd config
  o  1c114a ansible/hg-web: serve static files as immutable content
  o  d2cf48 ansible/hg-web: synchronize templates earlier
  o  c29f28 ansible/hg-web: convert hgrc to a template
  o  166549 ansible/hg-web: tell hgweb that static files are in /static/
  o  d46d6a ansible/hg-web: serve static template files from httpd
  o  37fdad testing: only print when in verbose mode
 /   (stack base)
o  e44c2e (@) testing: install Mercurial 4.8 final
</code></pre>
<p>When the entire series of commits is incorporated into the repository,
the end state of the files is the same, so all is well. But this strategy
of using <em>fixup commits</em> (while popular - especially with Git-based tooling
like GitHub that puts a larger emphasis on the end state of changes rather
than the individual commits) isn't practiced by all projects.
<strong><code>hg absorb</code> will not help you if this is your workflow.</strong></p>
<p>A popular variation of this <em>fixup commit</em> workflow is to author a new commit
then <em>incorporate</em> this commit into a prior commit. This typically involves
the following actions:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to a file&gt;

$ hg commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg histedit
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to a file&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git rebase --interactive
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, you produce a new commit. Then you run a history editing command.
You then tell that history editing command what to do (e.g. to <em>squash</em> or
<em>fold</em> one commit into another), that command performs work and produces a set
of rewritten commits.</p>
<p>In simple cases, you may make a simple change to a single file. Things are
pretty straightforward. You need to know which two commits to <em>squash</em> together.
This is often trivial. Although it can be cumbersome if there are several
commits and it isn't clear which one should be receiving the new changes.</p>
<p>In more complex cases, you may make multiple modifications to multiple files.
You may even want to <em>squash</em> your <em>fixups</em> into separate commits. And for some
code reviews, this <em>complex</em> case can be quite common. It isn't uncommon for me
to be incorporating dozens of reviewer-suggested changes across several commits!</p>
<p>These complex use cases are where things can get really complicated for version
control tool interactions. Let's say we want to make multiple changes to a file
and then incorporate those changes into multiple commits. To keep it simple,
let's assume 2 modifications in a single file <em>squashing</em> into 2 commits:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg commit --interactive
&lt;select changes to commit&gt;
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg histedit
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git add --interactive
&lt;select changes to stage&gt;

$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git rebase --interactive
&lt;manually choose which actions to perform to what commits&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the number of actions required by users has already increased
substantially. Not captured by the number of lines is the effort that must go
into the interactive commands like <code>hg commit --interactive</code>,
<code>git add --interactive</code>, <code>hg histedit</code>, and <code>git rebase --interactive</code>. For
these commands, users must tell the VCS tool exactly what actions to take.
This takes time and requires some cognitive load. This ultimately distracts
the user from the task at hand, which is bad for concentration and productivity.
The user just wants to <em>amend</em> old commits: telling the VCS tool what actions
to take is an obstacle in their way. (A compelling argument can be made that
the work required with these workflows to produce a <em>clean</em> history is too much
effort and it is easier to make the trade-off favoring simpler workflows
versus cleaner history.)</p>
<p><strong>These kinds of <em>squash fixup</em> workflows are what <code>hg absorb</code> is designed to
make easier.</strong> When using <code>hg absorb</code>, the above workflow can be reduced to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg absorb
&lt;hit y to accept changes&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg absorb --apply-changes
</code></pre>
<p>Let's assume the following changes are made in the working directory:</p>

<p><code>hg absorb</code> automatically figured out that the 2 separate uncommitted changes
<em>mapped</em> to 2 different changesets (Mercurial's term for <em>commit</em>). It
print a summary of what lines would be changed in what changesets and
prompted me to accept its <em>plan</em> for how to proceed. The human effort involved
is a quick review of the proposed changes and answering a prompt.</p>
<p>At a technical level, <code>hg absorb</code> finds all uncommitted changes and
attempts to map each changed line to an unambiguous prior commit. For
every change that can be mapped cleanly, the uncommitted changes are
<em>absorbed</em> into the appropriate prior commit. Commits impacted by the
operation are rebased automatically. If a change cannot be mapped to an
unambiguous prior commit, it is left uncommitted and users can fall back
to an existing workflow (e.g. using <code>hg histedit</code>).</p>
<p>But wait - there's more!</p>
<p>The automatic rewriting logic of <code>hg absorb</code> is implemented by following
the history of lines. This is fundamentally different from the approach
taken by <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase</code>, which tend to rely on <em>merge
strategies</em> based on the
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4129049/why-is-a-3-way-merge-advantageous-over-a-2-way-merge">3-way merge</a>
to derive a new version of a file given multiple input versions. This
approach combined with the fact that <code>hg absorb</code> skips over changes with
an ambiguous application commit means that <strong><code>hg absorb</code> will never
encounter merge conflicts</strong>! Now, you may be thinking <em>if you ignore
lines with ambiguous application targets, the patch would always apply
cleanly using a classical 3-way merge</em>. This statement logically sounds
correct. But it isn't: <code>hg absorb</code> can avoid merge conflicts when the
merging performed by <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> would fail.</p>
<p>The above example attempts to exercise such a use case. Focusing on the
initial change:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>When we use <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> to rewrite this history, the VCS
would first attempt to re-order commits before squashing 2 commits together.
When we attempt to reorder the <em>fixup</em> diff immediately after the commit that
introduces it, there is a good chance your VCS tool would encounter a merge
conflict. Essentially your VCS is thinking <em>you changed this line but the
lines around the change in the final version are different from the lines
in the initial version: I don't know if those other lines matter and therefore
I don't know what the end state should be, so I'm giving up and letting the
user choose for me</em>.</p>
<p>But since <code>hg absorb</code> operates at the line history level, it knows that this
individual line wasn't actually changed (even though the lines around it did),
assumes there is no conflict, and offers to <em>absorb</em> the change. So not only
is <code>hg absorb</code> significantly simpler than today's <code>hg histedit</code> or
<code>git rebase -i</code> workflows in terms of VCS command interactions, but it can
also avoid time-consuming merge conflict resolution as well!</p>
<p>Another feature of <code>hg absorb</code> is that all the rewriting occurs in memory
and the working directory is not touched when running the command. This means
that the operation is fast (working directory updates often account for a lot
of the execution time of <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase</code> commands). It also means
that tools looking at the last modified time of files (e.g. build systems
like GNU Make) won't rebuild extra (unrelated) files that were touched
as part of updating the working directory to an old commit in order to apply
changes. This makes <code>hg absorb</code> more friendly to edit-compile-test-commit
loops and allows developers to be more productive.</p>
<p>And that's <code>hg absorb</code> in a nutshell.</p>
<p>When I first saw a demo of <code>hg absorb</code> at a Mercurial developer meetup, my
jaw - along with those all over the room - hit the figurative floor. I thought
it was magical and too good to be true. I thought Facebook (the original authors
of the feature) were trolling us with an impossible demo. But it was all real.
And now <code>hg absorb</code> is available in the core Mercurial distribution for anyone
to use.  </p>
<p>From my experience, <code>hg absorb</code> <em>just works</em> almost all of the time: I run
the command and it maps all of my uncommitted changes to the appropriate
commit and there's nothing more for me to do! In a word, it is magical.</p>
<p>To use <code>hg absorb</code>, you'll need to activate the <code>absorb</code> extension. Simply
put the following in your <code>hgrc</code> config file:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
absorb =
</code></pre>
<p><code>hg absorb</code> is currently an experimental feature. That means there is
no commitment to backwards compatibility and some rough edges are
expected. I also anticipate new features (such as <code>hg absorb --interactive</code>)
will be added before the experimental label is removed. If you encounter
problems or want to leave comments, <a href="https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mercurial">file a bug</a>,
make noise in <code>#mercurial</code> on Freenode, or
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ContributingChanges">submit a patch</a>.
But don't let the <em>experimental</em> label scare you away from using it:
<code>hg absorb</code> is being used by some large install bases and also by many
of the Mercurial core developers. The <em>experimental</em> label is mainly there
because it is a brand new feature in core Mercurial and the <em>experimental</em>
label is usually affixed to new features.</p>
<p>If you practice workflows that frequently require amending old commits, I
think you'll be shocked at how much easier <code>hg absorb</code> makes these workflows.
I think you'll find it to be a game changer: once you use <code>hg abosrb</code>, you'll
soon wonder how you managed to get work done without it.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Back in 2015, I implemented a feature in Mercurial 3.6 that allows
servers to advertise URLs of pre-generated <em>bundle</em> files. When a
compatible client performs a <code>hg clone</code> against a repository leveraging
this feature, it downloads and applies the bundle from a URL then goes
back to the server and performs the equivalent of an <code>hg pull</code> to obtain
the changes to the repository made after the bundle was generated.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>, we've been using this
feature since 2015. We host bundles in Amazon S3 and make them available
via the CloudFront CDN. We perform
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/99f7164339ed/hgext/hgmo/__init__.py#l1022">IP filtering on the server</a>
so clients connecting from AWS IPs are served S3 URLs corresponding to
the closest region / S3 bucket where bundles are hosted. Most
Firefox build and test automation is run out of EC2 and automatically
clones high-volume repositories from an S3 bucket hosted in the same
AWS region. (Doing an intra-region transfer is very fast and clones
can run at &gt;50 MB/s.) Everyone else clones from a CDN. See our
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">official docs</a>
for more.</p>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2015/10/22/cloning-improvements-in-mercurial-3.6/">last reported</a>
on this feature in October 2015. Since then, Bitbucket also
<a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2017/02/bitbucket-CDN-cloning/">deployed this feature</a>
in early 2017.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this <em>clone bundles</em> feature this week when
kernel.org posted
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/best-way-to-do-linux-clones-for-your-ci.html">Best way to do linux clones for your CI</a>
and that post was making the rounds in my version control circles.
tl;dr git.kernel.org apparently suffers high load due to high
clone volume against the Linux Git repository and since Git doesn't
have an equivalent feature to clone bundles built in to Git itself,
they are asking people to perform equivalent functionality to mitigate
server load.</p>
<p>(A <em>clone bundles</em> feature has been discussed on the Git mailing list
before. I remember finding old discussions when I was doing research
for Mercurial's feature in 2015. I'm sure the topic has come up since.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I'd provide an update on just how valuable the
<em>clone bundles</em> feature is to Mozilla. In doing so, I hope maintainers
of other version control tools see the obvious benefits and consider
adopting the feature sooner.</p>
<p>In a typical week, hg.mozilla.org is currently serving ~135 TB of
data. The overwhelming majority of this data is related to the Mercurial
wire protocol (i.e. not HTML / JSON served from the web interface).
Of that ~135 TB, ~5 TB is served from the CDN, ~126 TB is served from
S3, and ~4 TB is served from the Mercurial servers themselves. In other
words, <strong>we're offloading ~97% of bytes served from the Mercurial servers
to S3 and the CDN</strong>.</p>
<p>If we assume this offloaded ~131 TB is equally distributed throughout
the week, this comes out to ~1,732 Mbps on average. In reality, we do
most of our load from California's Sunday evenings to early Friday
evenings. And load is typically concentrated in the 12 hours when
the sun is over Europe and North America (where most of Mozilla's
employees are based). So the typical throughput we are offloading is
more than 2 Gbps. And at a lower level, automation tends to perform
clones soon after a push is made. So load fluctuates significantly
throughout the day, corresponding to when pushes are made.</p>
<p>By volume, most of the data being offloaded is for the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified">mozilla-unified</a> Firefox
repository. Without clone bundles and without the special <em>stream
clone</em> Mercurial feature (which we also leverage via clone bundles), the
servers would be generating and sending ~1,588 MB of zstandard level 3
compressed data for each clone of that repository. Each clone would
consume ~280s of CPU time on the server. And at ~195,000 clones per
month, that would come out to ~309 TB/mo or ~72 TB/week. In CPU time,
that would be ~54.6 million CPU-seconds, or ~21 CPU-months. I will
leave it as an exercise to the reader to attach a dollar cost to how
much it would take to operate this service without clone bundles. But
I will say the total AWS bill for our S3 and CDN hosting for this
service is under $50 per month. (It is worth noting that intra-region
data transfer from S3 to other AWS services is free. And we are
definitely taking advantage of that.)</p>
<p>Despite a significant increase in the size of the Firefox repository and
clone volume of it since 2015, our servers are still performing less
work (in terms of bytes transferred and CPU seconds consumed) than they
were in 2015. The ~97% of bytes and millions of CPU seconds offloaded
in any given week have given us a lot of breathing room and have
saved Mozilla several thousand dollars in hosting costs. The feature
has likely helped us avoid many operational incidents due to high server
load. It has made Firefox automation faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>Succinctly, Mercurial's <em>clone bundles</em> feature has successfully and
largely effortlessly offloaded a ton of load from the hg.mozilla.org
Mercurial servers. Other version control tools should implement this
feature because it is a game changer for server operators <strong>and</strong>
results in a better client-side experience (eliminates server-side CPU
bottleneck and may eliminate network bottleneck due to a geo-local CDN
typically being as fast as your Internet pipe). It's a win-win. And a
massive win if you are operating at scale.</p>

  <p>As of Firefox 60, the build environment for official Firefox Linux builds
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399679">switched</a> from CentOS
to Debian.</p>
<p>As part of the transition, we overhauled how the build environment for
Firefox is constructed. We now populate the environment from deterministic
package snapshots and are much more stringent about dependencies and operations
being deterministic and reproducible. The end result is that the build
environment for Firefox is deterministic enough to enable Firefox itself
to be built deterministically.</p>
<p>Changing the underlying operating system environment used for builds was
a risky change. Differences in the resulting build could result in new
bugs or some users not being able to run the official builds. We figured
a good way to mitigate that risk was to make the old and new builds as
bit-identical as possible. After all, if the environments produce the same
bits, then nothing has effectively changed and there should be no new risk
for end-users.</p>
<p>Employing the <em>diffoscope</em> tool, we identified areas where Firefox builds
weren't deterministic in the same environment and where there was variance
across build environments. We iterated on differences and changed systems
so variance would no longer occur. By the end of the process, we had
bit-identical Firefox builds across environments.</p>
<p>So, as of Firefox 60, Firefox builds on Linux are deterministic in our
official build environment!</p>
<p>That being said, the builds we ship to users are using PGO. And an
end-to-end build involving PGO is intrinsically not deterministic because
it relies on timing data that varies from one run to the next. And we don't
yet have continuous automated end-to-end testing that determinism holds.
But the underlying infrastructure to support deterministic and reproducible
Firefox builds is there and is not going away. I think that's a milestone
worth celebrating.</p>
<p>This milestone required the effort of many people, often working indirectly
toward it. Debian's <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds">reproducible builds</a>
effort gave us an operating system that provided deterministic and
reproducible guarantees. Switching Firefox CI to Taskcluster enabled us
to switch to Debian relatively easily. Many were involved with
non-determinism fixes in Firefox over the years. But Mike Hommey drove the
transition of the build environment to Debian and he deserves recognition for
his individual contribution. Thanks to all these efforts - and especially Mike
Hommey's - we can now say <em>Firefox builds deterministically</em>!</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885777">fx-reproducible-build</a> bug
tracks ongoing efforts to further improve the reproducibility story of
Firefox. (~300 bugs in its dependency tree have already been resolved!)</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>One of the central themes of my time at Mozilla has been my pursuit
of making it easier to contribute to and hack on Firefox.</p>
<p>I vividly remember my first day at Mozilla in 2011 when I went to
build Firefox for the first time. I thought the entire experience -
from obtaining the source code, installing build dependencies, building,
running tests, submitting patches for review, etc was quite... lacking.
When I asked others if they thought this was an issue, many rightfully
identified problems (like the build system being slow). But there was
a significant population who seemed to be naive and/or apathetic to
the breadth of the user experience shortcomings. This is totally
understandable: the scope of the problem is immense and various
people don't have the perspective, are blinded/biased by personal
experience, and/or don't have the product design or UX experience
necessary to comprehend the problem.</p>
<p><strong>When it comes to contributing to Firefox, I think the problems have
as much to do with user experience (UX) as they do with technical
matters.</strong> As I
<a href="/blog/2012/05/07/improving-the-mozilla-build-system-experience/">wrote in 2012</a>,
<em>user experience matters and developers are people too.</em> You can have
a technically superior product, but if the UX is bad, you will have a
hard time attracting and retaining new users. And existing users won't
be as happy. These are the kinds of problems that a product manager or
designer deals with. A difference is that in the case of Firefox
development, the target audience is a very narrow and highly
technically-minded subset of the larger population - much smaller than
what your typical product targets. The total addressable population is
(realistically) in the thousands instead of millions. But this doesn't
mean you ignore the principles of good product design when designing
developer tooling. <strong>When it comes to developer tooling and workflows, I
think it is important to have a <em>product manager</em> mindset and treat it
not as a collection of tools for technically-minded individuals, but as
a product having an overall experience.</strong> You only have to look as far as
the Firefox Developer Tools to see this approach applied and the positive
results it has achieved.</p>
<p>Historically, Mozilla has lacked a formal team with the domain expertise
and mandate to treat Firefox contribution as a <em>product</em>. We didn't have
anything close to this until a few years ago. Before we had such a team,
I took on some of these problems individually. In 2012, I wrote <code>mach</code> - a
generic CLI command dispatch tool - to provide a central, convenient,
and easy-to-use command to discover development actions and to run them.
(Read the <a href="/blog/2012/09/26/mach-has-landed/">announcement blog post</a> for
some historical context.) I also
<a href="/blog/2012/09/18/bootstrap-your-system-to-build-firefox/">introduced</a>
a one-line bootstrap tool (now <code>mach bootstrap</code>) to make it easier to
configure your machine for building Firefox. A few months later, I
was responsible for
<a href="/blog/2013/02/28/moz.build-files-and-the-firefox-build-system/">introducing moz.build files</a>,
which paved the way for countless optimizations and for rearchitecting
the Firefox build system to use modern tools - a project that is still
ongoing (digging out from ~two decades of technical debt is a massive
effort). And a few months after that, I started going down the version
control rabbit hole and improving matters there. And I was also heavily
involved with MozReview for improving the code review experience.</p>
<p>Looking back, I was responsible for and participated in a ton of
foundational changes to how Firefox is developed. Of course, dozens of
others have contributed to getting us to where we are today and I can't
and won't take credit for the hard work of others. Nor will I claim I was the
only person coming up with good ideas or transforming them into reality. I
can name several projects (like Taskcluster and Treeherder) that have
been just as or more transformational than the changes I can take credit
for. It would be vain and naive of me to elevate my contributions on a
taller pedestal and I hope nobody reads this and thinks I'm doing that.</p>
<p>(On a personal note, numerous people have told me that things like <code>mach</code>
and the bootstrap tool have transformed the Firefox contribution experience
for the better. I've also had very senior people tell me that they don't
understand why these tools are important and/or are skeptical of the need
for investments in this space. I've found this dichotomy perplexing and
troubling. Because some of the <em>detractors</em> (for lack of a better word) are
highly influential and respected, their apparent skepticism sews seeds of
doubt and causes me to second guess my contributions and world view. This
feels like a form or variation of imposter syndrome and it is something I
have struggled with during my time at Mozilla.)</p>
<p>From my perspective, the previous five or so years in Firefox development
workflows has been about initiating foundational changes and executing on
them. When it was introduced, <code>mach</code> was <em>radical</em>. It didn't do much and
its use was optional. Now almost everyone uses it. Similar stories have
unfolded for Taskcluster, MozReview, and various other tools and
platforms. In other words, we laid a foundation and have been steadily
building upon it for the past several years. That's not to say other
foundational changes haven't occurred since (they have - the imminent switch
to Phabricator is a terrific example). But the volume of foundational
changes has slowed since 2012-2014. (I think this is due to Mozilla
deciding to invest more in tools as a result of growing pains from
significant company expansion that began in 2010. With that investment, we
invested in the bigger ticket long-standing workflow pain points, such as
CI (Taskcluster), the Firefox build system, Treeherder, and code review.)</p>
<h2>Workflows Today and in the Future</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, the size, scope, and complexity of Firefox
development activities has increased.</p>
<p>One way to see this is at the source code level. The following chart
shows the size of the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/">mozilla-central</a>
version control repository over time.</p>
<p><img alt="mozilla-central size over time" src="/images/firefox-repo-size-over-time.png" /></p>
<p>The size increases are obvious. The increases cumulatively represent
new features, technologies, and workflows. For example, the repository
contains thousands of <em>Web Platform Tests</em> (WPT) files, a shared test
suite for web platform implementations, like Gecko and Blink. WPT didn't
exist a few years ago. Now we have files under source control, tools for
running those tests, and workflows revolving around changing those tests.
The incorporation of Rust and components of Servo into Firefox is also
responsible for significant changes. Firefox features such as Developer
Tools have been introduced or ballooned in size in recent years. The
<em>Go Faster</em> project and the move to system add-ons has introduced various
new workflows and challenges for testing Firefox.</p>
<p>Many of these changes are building upon the user-facing foundational
workflow infrastructure that was last significantly changed in 2012-2014.
This has definitely contributed to some growing pains. For example, there
are now 92 <code>mach</code> commands instead of like 5. <code>mach help</code> - intended to
answer <em>what can I do and how should I do it</em> - is overwhelming, especially
to new users. The repository is around 2 gigabytes of data to clone instead
of around 500 megabytes. We have 240,000 files in a full checkout instead
of 70,000 files. There's a <strong>ton</strong> of new pieces floating around. Any
product manager tasked with user acquisition and retention will tell you
that increasing the barrier to entry and use will jeopardize these
outcomes. But with the growth of Firefox's technical underbelly in the
previous years, we've made it harder to contribute by requiring users to
download and see a lot more files (version control) and be overwhelmed
by all the options for actions to take (<code>mach</code> having 92 commands). And
as the sheer number of components constituting Firefox increases, it
becomes harder and harder for everyone - not just new contributors - to
reason about how everything fits together.</p>
<p>I've been framing this general problem as <em>scaling Firefox development
workflows</em> and <strong>every time I think about the high-level challenges facing
Firefox contribution today and in the years ahead, this problem floats
to the top of my list of concerns</strong>. Yes, we have pressing issues like
improving the code review experience and making the Firefox build
system and Taskcluster-based CI fast, efficient, and reliable. But even
if you make these individual pieces great, there is still a cross-domain
problem of how all these components weave together. <strong>This is why I think
it is important to take a wholistic view and treat developer workflow
as a product.</strong></p>
<p>When I look at this the way a product manager or designer would, I see a
few fundamental problems that need addressing.</p>
<p>First, we're not optimizing for comprehensive end-to-end workflows. By and
large, we're designing our tools in isolation. We focus more on maximizing
the individual components instead of maximizing the interaction between
them. For example, Taskcluster and Treeherder are pretty good in isolation.
But we're missing features like Treeherder being able to tell me the
command to run locally to reproduce a failure: I want to see a failure on
Treeherder and be able to copy and paste commands into my terminal to
debug the failure. In the case of code review, we've designed two good
code review tools (MozReview and Phabricator) but we haven't invested in
making submitting code reviews turn key (the initial system configuration
is difficult and we still don't have things like automatic bug filing or
reviewer selection). <strong>We are leaving many workflow optimizations on
the table by not implementing thoughtful tie-ins and transitions between
various tools.</strong></p>
<p>Second, by-and-large we're still optimizing for a single, monolithic user
segment instead of recognizing and optimizing for different users and
their workflow requirements. For example, <code>mach help</code> lists 92 commands.
I don't think any single person cares about all 92 of those commands. The
average person may only care about 10 or even 20. In terms of user
interface design, the features and workflow requirements of small user
segments are polluting the interface for all users and making the entire
experience complicated and difficult to reason about. As a concrete
example, why should a system add-on developer or a Firefox Developer Tools
developer (these people tend to care about testing a standalone Firefox
add-on) care about Gecko's build system or tests? If you aren't touching
Gecko or Firefox's <em>chrome</em> code, why should you be exposed to workflows
and requirements that don't have a major impact on you? Or something more
extreme, if you are developing a standalone Rust module or Python package
in mozilla-central, why do you need to care about Firefox at all? (Yes,
Firefox or another downstream consumer may care about changes to that
<em>standalone</em> component and you can't ignore those dependencies. But it
should at least be possible to hide those dependencies.)</p>
<p>Waving my hands, the solution to these problems is to treat Firefox
development workflow as a product and to apply the same rigor that we
use for actual Firefox product development. Give people with a vision
for the entire workflow the ability to prioritize investment across
tools and platforms. Give them a process for defining features that
work across tools. Perform formal user studies. See how people are
actually using the tools you build. Bring in design and user experience
experts to help formulate better workflows. Perform user typing so
different, segmentable workflows can be optimized for. Treat developers
as you treat users of <em>real</em> products: listen to them. Give developers
a voice to express frustrations. Let them tell you what they are trying
to do and what they wish they could do. Integrate this feedback into a
feature roadmap. Turn common feedback into action items for new features.</p>
<p>If you think these ideas are silly and it doesn't make sense to apply a
<em>product mindset</em> to developer workflows and tooling, then you should be
asking whether product management and all that it entails is also a silly
idea. If you believe that aspects of product management have beneficial
outcomes (which most companies do because otherwise there wouldn't be
product managers), then why <em>wouldn't</em> you want to apply the methods of
that discipline to developers and development workflows? Developers are
users too and the fact that they work for the same company that is
creating the product shouldn't make them immune from the benefits of
product management.</p>
<p>If we want to make contributing to Firefox an even better experience for
Mozilla employees and community contributors, I think we need to take a step
back and assess the situation as a product manager would. The improvements
that have been made to the individual pieces constituting Firefox's
development workflow during my nearly seven years at Mozilla have been
incredible. But I think in order to achieve the next round of major
advancements in workflow productivity, we'll need to focus on how all of
the pieces fit together. And that requires treating the entire workflow
as a cohesive product.</p>
