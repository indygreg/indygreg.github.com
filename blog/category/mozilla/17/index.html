  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Have you ever wondered what the machines in Mozilla's automation
infrastructure are doing all the time? I have. So, I decided to create a
visualization of this data. You can find it at
<a href="http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/">http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/</a>.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the visualizations, you notice something:
there's a lot of time when machines aren't doing anything! All that
white space between jobs is time machines are not processing jobs. This
is capacity Mozilla is failing to utilize.</p>
<p>While some may say Mozilla's automation infrastructure has a load or
capacity problem, I say it has an efficiency problem. The average
machine in our automation infrastructure is doing work less than 50% of
the time <em>during weekdays</em>. Now, some of this might be VMs that are
powered off (due to low demand). But considering physical machines are
also under-utilized, I'd say it's a global problem.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't get too hung up with a machine-job efficiency metric.
While important, it's only part of the problem. When jobs are running,
they are typically only using a fraction of the CPU available to them.
From data <a href="/blog/2013/07/14/quantifying-mozilla's-automation-efficiency/">now available in mozharness</a>,
we know that many test suites only use 10-15% CPU. If you combine this
with sub-50% machine utilization in terms of jobs, I estimate we're only
utilizing somewhere between 5-10% of available CPU cycles in our automation
infrastructure. We have a magnitude more capacity in the machines we
already have. <strong>We don't have a capacity problem, we have an efficiency
problem.</strong> In my opinion we should throw less time and money at new
hardware and invest in maximizing the return from what we have.</p>
<h2>Edit 2013-09-03</h2>
<p>I started a thread about this data in another forum and others have
pointed out that the data in this post is incomplete. Notably absent
from this data is when on-demand EC2 instances are shut down, when there
are or aren't jobs scheduled (if jobs aren't scheduled, poor machine
utilization isn't such a big deal), and when some maintainence tasks are
performed (e.g. Panda boards are checked for consistency between jobs).
While we could probably hook job scheduling data up to the graph and
numbers easily, I don't believe data on slave <em>uptime</em> or background
tasks is publicly available. Perhaps we should publish this data to
facilitate deeper analysis.</p>
<p>A goal of this post was to shed light on how little we utilize some of
the machines in our automation infrastructure in order to inspire a
conversation and ultimately to address the perceived problem. It was
not a goal to point fingers and cast blame. If I inadvertently
performed the latter or seemed to jump to conclusions based on
incomplete data, I apologize.</p>

  <p>I'm a big fan of tools that encourage and/or enforce the following of
best practices and that help people become more productive.</p>
<p>One of the tools that Firefox developers interact with nearly daily is
Mercurial. As I've observed from coworkers and from community
contributors, many don't have Mercurial configured for optimal
development. For first-time contributors, this can manifest in patch
rejection - an experience that can be embarassing and demotivating. This
is frustrating to me because most issues are easily identifiable and
correctable. And, when addressed, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pleased to announce that there is now a configuration wizard
in the Firefox source tree to help with configuring Mercurial. To run it,
just type:</p>
<pre><code>./mach mercurial-setup
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, it's aimed for first-time contributors. So, it's missing
things that more seasoned developers rely on. But you need to start
somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Currently, the tool isn't advertised anywhere other than <em>mach help</em>.
Please run it and report issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a> or
file a new report. Once things have baked in, I'd like to add some kind
of notification/tips system to mach where it will encourage you to do
things like automatically run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>. Until then, I
recommend trying to remember to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> every few
weeks to ensure your Mercurial environment is up to date and properly
configured.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Nick Alexander for sharing my enthusiasm for helping
contributors and for taking the time to review this work.</p>

  <p>My <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/mozext">Mercurial extension for Firefox development</a>
now has an initial implementation of pushlog aggregation and searching.</p>
<p>You first start by synchronizing the pushlog data on Mozilla's servers
with the local client:</p>
<pre><code>hg pushlogsync
</code></pre>
<p>This takes a while the first time you run it because it has to download
all the data. On subsequent runs, it only downloads new data, so it
should be much faster.</p>
<p>Then, you can search for the push history of a changeset:</p>

  <p>My weekend was spent hacking on Mercurial extensions. First, I worked on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827123">porting the pushlog extension off SQLite</a>.
This will eventually enable Mozilla to move Mercurial hosting off NFS
and should make <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> much faster as
a result!</p>
<p>But the main purpose of this blog post is to introduce a new Mercurial
extension I wrote this weekend!</p>
<p>Gecko developers perform a number of common tasks with Mercurial, so I
thought it would be handy to package them up in an extension.</p>
<p>To install the extension:</p>
<pre><code>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools
</code></pre>
<p>Then add this extension to your hgrc file (either the global or
per-repository will suffice):</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
mozext = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/mozext
</code></pre>
<p>Since I believe tools should be self-documenting, run the following for
usage info:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg help mozext
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="c"># Clone mozilla-central into the mc directory.</span>
hg clone central mc
hg clone mc mc

<span class="c"># Create a unified Mercurial repository containing changesets</span>
<span class="c"># from all the release repositories.</span>
hg cloneunified gecko

<span class="c"># Pull changes from the central and inbound repositories.</span>
hg pull central
hg pull inbound

<span class="c"># Update the working tree to the tip of inbound.</span>
hg up inbound/default

<span class="c"># View the tree open/closed status.</span>
hg treestatus

<span class="c"># Show a list of all known trees and their aliases.</span>
hg moztrees

<span class="c"># Open TBPL for the push containing a changeset.</span>
hg tbpl inbound 821e984ef423
hg tbpl inbound inbound/default

<span class="c"># Push the tip of inbound to mozilla-central</span>
hg pushtree -r inbound/default central
</pre></div>

<p>I've only tested this extension with Mercurial 2.6 (which every Mozilla
developer should be running). I'm not willing to support older versions.
Upgrade already!</p>
<p>There are a number of features I'd like to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hg importtry</strong> - Automatically import changesets for a Try push into
  the repository.</li>
<li><strong>hg land</strong> - Automatically land patches on an integration tree (like
  inbound). Will handle rebasing automatically.</li>
<li><strong>hg critic</strong> - Perform stlye checking and other analysis on a
  changeset or group of changesets.</li>
<li>Ability to integrate build status into changeset info. This will allow
  things such as <em>pull only the last green changeset</em>. I'd also like a
  <em>build status</em> field to appear in the log output. Unfortunately, I
  believe the latency of the build lookup API is prohibitively high to
  perform the kind of tight integration I'd like.</li>
<li>Move <em>mozautomation</em> Python package into a standalone package or
  integrate already existing code (did I reinvent the wheel?).</li>
<li>Log fetching. Specify a changeset and fetch build/test logs.</li>
<li>Possibly move code into mozilla-central.</li>
<li>Possibly add mach commands for some of this functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no bug component for this extension (yet). If you find any
issues or wish to add a feature, just email a patch to me at gps@mozilla.com.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find this useful or if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>Mozilla operates thousands of machines whose sole role is to build
Firefox (and related applications), run tests, perform static analysis,
etc. This is collectively referred to as the <em>Firefox/Mozilla build
automation</em> or just <em>automation</em>. The output of all this automation
can be seen at <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">tbpl.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll give an overview of how all this automation works
followed by a critical analysis identifying what I like and what I
feel should be improved.</p>
<h2>How Firefox automation works</h2>
<p>Let's take a journey through what happens when you push a new revision
of <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/">mozilla-central</a> (the main
Firefox repository) to Mozilla's canonical Mercurial server. (For
Mozilla people, this journey is roughly the same regardless of which
automation-enabled project branch you push to.) While Firefox's
automation infrastructure kicks off builds on
<a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">several platforms and operating systems</a>,
for simplicity reasons, I'm going to limit low-level technical details
to our 64-bit Linux builds.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a disclaimer: I'm not a subject expert in much of
what I'm about to say. There are people who spend a magnitude more time
than myself touching the systems I'm about to describe. If I get
something wrong, please contact me and I'll update this post.</p>
<p>Let's begin.</p>
<h3>Buildbot</h3>
<p>The heart of Firefox's build automation is a piece of software called
<a href="http://buildbot.net/">Buildbot</a>. Buildbot is essentially a glorified
job scheduling system. I find the
<a href="http://buildbot.net/#/basics">buildbot basics</a> covers, well, the basics
pretty well. What you need to know is that Mozilla maintains a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot/">buildbot repository</a> that
appears to contain the buildbot core plus basic customization for
Mozilla.</p>
<p>There are buildbot <em>masters</em> and <em>slaves</em>. <em>masters</em> do all
the coordination and scheduling; <em>slaves</em> do all the real work (such as
compiling Firefox). Mozilla operates a handful of masters and a few
thousand slaves.</p>
<p>When you push code to a project branch (like <em>mozilla-central</em>), a
buildbot master sees the push then figures out what needs to happen. For
<em>mozilla-central</em>, the push gets translated to a request to build on
several different platforms. These requests then go to a scheduler
(possibly getting collapsed into a single request). These requests then
get turned into jobs that run on slaves.</p>
<p>This logic mostly lives in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/">buildbot-configs repository</a>.
Of particular interest is the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/file/e8b27b8b7216/mozilla/config.py">config.py</a>
file, which pretty much defines how buildbot is configured at Mozilla -
at a high-level anyway.</p>
<p>When a scheduled job executes, the high-level job request is converted into
low-level actions (or <em>steps</em> in buildbot parlance) that get executed on
slaves. For example, a request to build might clone the source
repository, run client.mk, package the results, etc. This logic lives
in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/">buildbotcustom repository</a>.
It's worth highlighting the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py">factory.py</a> file. This file contains the beef of the logic
for converting high-level jobs into actions on slaves. Start at the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l379">MozillaBuildFactory class</a>
class to see exactly what goes into performing a build. Then move on to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l1338">addDoBuildSteps()</a>,
which contains the command for invoking the actual build system. As you
can see, there's a lot that goes into building besides just invoking the
build system (like most developers do)!</p>
<p>For many automation jobs, there is an additional component that comes
into play: <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/">mozharness</a>.
<em>mozharness</em> is relatively new to the Firefox build automation
landscape so you may not be familiar with it. A goal of <em>mozharness</em> is
to largely migrate the low-level logic from <em>buildbotcustom</em> - the logic
that converts a high-level job request into low-level buildbot <em>steps</em>
(typically command invocations) - into a separate, standalone entity
that doesn't depend on buildbot. A goal is to enable developers to run
mozharness locally and run automation jobs just like the official
automation infrastructure does. If you have time, I encourage you to
read the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozharness_FAQ">mozharness FAQ</a>
to learn more. My understanding is <em>mozharness</em> will eventually power
<strong>all</strong> of the jobs currently defined in <em>buildbotcustom</em>, so I
recommend getting acquainted with <em>mozharness</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>mozharness</em> world, automation jobs are defined as <em>scripts</em>.
Here's the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/file/84187194b050/scripts/marionette.py">marionette script</a>.
You just execute a script (with ideally as few arguments as possible)
and <em>mozharness</em> does the rest. In buildbot, instead of having a job
with say 12 steps and this logic for configuring the steps live in
buildbot, buildbot just says <em>run the marionette mozharness script</em>.
Since very little business logic now lives in buildbot, this essentially
reduces buildbot's role to just job scheduling.</p>
<p>And that is essentially how the automation determines what to run. Now
let's talk about the machines automation runs on.</p>
<h3>Machine provisioning</h3>
<p>Earlier, I said Mozilla operates thousands of buildbot slaves. Let's
talk about how those slaves come into existence.</p>
<p>A slave is just a fancy name for a machine, either physical or virtual.
These machines are owned or operated by Mozilla. Mozilla either buys
a physical machine or rents one from a <em>cloud provider</em>, like Amazon
EC2.</p>
<p>For hopefully obvious reasons, it is important for the configuration of
these machines to be consistent. Let's talk about how that is done. Keep
in mind I'm talking about Linux machines. OS X and Windows machines go
through a different procedure.</p>
<p>When a new machine is acquired, it needs an operating system. There is a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/setup/centos6-kickstart.cfg.erb">kickstart config file</a>
that installs CentOS 6.2. At the end of the base OS flash/install, it
configures Puppet to talk to a central Puppet master. This Puppet
infrastructure is called
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/PuppetAgain">PuppetAgain</a>
and its files are stored in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/">puppet repository</a>.</p>
<p>Puppet is let loose on the fresh OS install and eventually the machine
is configured so it is homogenous with other similar machines in the
automation infrastructure. Presumably, Puppet continually polls the
central Puppet master and applies the latest configuration.</p>
<p>Part of the <em>puppetization</em> of this machine involves installing the
buildbot client. The client eventually registers with the buildbot
master and waits for jobs to process.</p>
<p>So, we've described how machines are provisioned as buildbot slaves and
how buildbot jobs are converted to actions/steps/commands to be
performed on slaves. Let's examine a job in more detail.</p>
<h3>Running a build job</h3>
<p>Before I talk about the details of a build job, it's worth mentioning
that nearly everything I described up until this point is largely hidden
from view from most Firefox developers. As far as I know, things like
Puppet logs are hidden from public view. And there shouldn't be anything
terribly wrong with that: the Puppet configs are public, after all.
Unless you are affiliated with Release Engineering or the Automation and
Tools Team (A*Team) or hack on a component that warrants its own piece
of automation, you probably aren't too concerned with how all of this
works.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's finally time to start talking about something almost every
Firefox developer has done: build Firefox from source.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, code in <em>buildbotcustom</em> (to be replaced by
<em>mozharness</em> someday) is responsible for turning a Firefox build job
into a series of actions/steps/commands to run on a slave. And, lucky
for us, the activity of a slave is captured and saved to text log files!
If you've ever used <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">TBPL</a>, you've almost
certainly clicked a link to view one of these logs.</p>
<p>In this section, I'll describe the steps performed in
<a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-linux64/1371941584/mozilla-central-linux64-bm62-build1-build35.txt.gz">this log</a>
from a recent <em>mozilla-central</em> build on a 64-bit Linux machine.
I will be paying particular attention to steps that affect the
build environment (for reasons that will be revealed in my critique
below).</p>
<p>If you load our log of interest next to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbotcustom/file/bdcca6f7b6c2/process/factory.py#l764">factory.py</a>
from <em>buildbotcustom</em>, you can start to see how they are related.
You may notice <em>self.addStep()</em> calls in <em>factory.py</em> correspond to
<em>========= Started</em> ... <em>========= Finished</em> sections in the log.
That's no accident: every <em>addStep()</em> call produces a section like
that in the log.</p>
<p>Now let's look at some of those steps in detail.</p>
<p>The job/log contains a number of <em>set property</em> steps. Search for
<em>set props</em> and you'll find them in the log. These steps define named
properties in a hash map buildbot uses to represent the current
configuration/state. Think of these properties as a way for buildbot to
communicate metadata between masters and slaves.</p>
<p>One of the first interesting steps we see is the cloning of the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools">tools repository</a>. Search for
<em>Started clone build tools</em> and you'll find it. This repository contains
a lot of support tools and scripts used by all parts of automation.
There's lots of useful tools in there!</p>
<p>Skipping over the steps that check whether to clobber the builder or
purge old content from disk, the next build steps relevant to our
interests involve the population of a <em>mock</em> environment.
Search for <em>Started mock-tgt mozilla-centos6-x86_64</em> to find it in the
logs.</p>
<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock">Mock</a> is a piece of
software that manages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroots</a>.
It was written by the Fedora project for creating isolated build
environments for software packages. For reasons unknown to me,
Mozilla runs a forked version of mock called
<a href="https://github.com/jhford/mock_mozilla">mock_mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>The build job creates a fresh mock environment on every build. (This is
clearly indicated by the <em>INFO: chroot
(/builds/mock_mozilla/mozilla-centos6-x86_64) unlocked and deleted</em>
line in the log.) Later on, builds are performed inside this mock
environment. This means that every build job is mostly isolated from
both the underlying operating system and all build jobs that came
before.</p>
<p>You can see the creation of the new mock environment by looking for the
<em>mock_mozilla -r mozilla-centos6-x86_64 --init</em> command in the log. This
is using the <em>mozilla-centos6-x86_64</em> configuration file to create the new
environment. This file is managed by Puppet, so you can
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/mockbuild/files/mozilla-centos6-x86_64.cfg">see it</a>
in the <em>puppet</em> repository. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/mockbuild/files/mozilla-centos6-x86_64.cfg#l11">setup command</a>
on line 11 is the most important line in this file: it defines what
commands to run to initialize the new mock environment.</p>
<p>Populating the mock environment takes a number of buildbot steps. After
copying a bunch of files into the mock/chroot, the mock environment is
further initialized by installing a number of packages. Search for
<em>Started mock-install</em> in the log. Yum is being used to install a number
of packages required to build Firefox. This package list appears to
come from
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/buildbot-configs/file/e8b27b8b7216/mozilla/config.py#l208">config.py</a>
in the <em>buildbot-configs</em> repository. These packages are downloaded from
a Yum repository hosted by Mozilla. Altogether, 249 new packages
consuming 821 MB are installed during this step!</p>
<p>After the <em>mock</em> environment is created, the <em>mozharness</em> repository is
removed, re-cloned, and updated to the <em>production</em> branch. After that,
we pull changes from <em>mozilla-central</em> and update the local checkout to
the revision we've been told to build.</p>
<p>If you search for <em>Started got mozconfig</em>, you'll find where the
<em>mozconfig</em> file (the build system configuration file) is acquired.</p>
<p>After that, the
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Applications/Tooltool">tooltool</a>
configuration is consulted. Tooltool is essentially a content-addressable
file store: files are stored and retrieved by the hash value of their
content. A manifest file inside <em>mozilla-central</em> defines the set of
files to fetch from tooltool at build time. At this step of the build,
that file is consulted and listed files are downloaded. While the Linux
manifest is currently empty, the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e7e9726025da/browser/config/tooltool-manifests/macosx64/releng.manifest">OS X tooltool manifest</a>
defines the digest of the Clang archive to use to build the tree.</p>
<p>Since tooltool files are addressed by content (not merely by name), this
means that the same file will be fetched no matter when the build runs.
In other words, behavior is constant as the contents of the tooltool
repository itself change (or at least it should be).</p>
<p>After <em>tooltool</em> contents sync, we finally arrive at the actual build
step. Search for <em>Started compile</em> in the log. The important detail here
is that <em>mock_mozilla</em> is used to build firefox with <em>client.mk</em> inside
the fresh mock/chroot environment.</p>
<p>After building, we move on to other tasks, such as creating a
distributable package, running tests, etc. I'm just going to glance over
them because there's a lot going on and it would take a long time to
explain it all! I encourage you to look at the steps in the log and
learn.</p>
<p>While these steps are going on, the buildbot master is notified that the
build and packaging aspect of the job has completed (sometime before
<em>make check</em> is executed). Upon receiving this success notification, the
buildbot master scheduled derived jobs, notably all the test suites
(reftests, mochitests, xpcshell tests, etc). This scheduling occurs
before <em>make check</em> has completed so overall turnaround time is reduced
as much as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the log, the slave/machine is rebooted. At this
point, the job has finished. TBPL colors the <em>B</em> next to the job green
to signal successul completion. The slave waits for its next job from
the buildbot master.</p>
<p>And that is how Firefox is built! I could go into details for all of the
derived test jobs, but I won't, as that would take a lot of effort! I
leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The Firefox build automation is complex and composed of many pieces.
It's a testament to a lot of people's hard work that it works as well as
it does!</p>
<p>From my experience at a previous job managing large numbers of servers
in a production datacenter, I commend Release Engineering for deploying
Puppet to help ensure the machines performing Firefox's build automation
are in a consistent state. I also like how <em>mock</em> is used to mostly
isolate build jobs from one another. These are both very important to
ensure Firefox is built consistently over time.</p>
<p>The on-going migration of automation logic from <em>buildbotcustom</em> to
<em>mozharness</em> is a fantastic project and I hope it is completed soon.
I hold hope that one day we can integrate <em>mozharness</em> into the local
development workflow (likely transparently through tools like <em>mach</em>)
and local developers can invoke actions using the same code path as the
official automation infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Areas for improvement</h2>
<p>The Firefox build automation largely works well. And I don't mean to
take away from that. However, there are a number of areas where
things could be improved. In this section, I'll talk about some of them.</p>
<p>Before I get into details, let me share an experience I had about a year
ago.</p>
<h3>A tale of modifying the xpcshell test harness</h3>
<p>In April 2012, I was writing a lot of JavaScript testing code and was
frustrated at how difficult it was to share test helper code between
tests. I filed
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748490">bug 748490</a>
to request a new feature in the JavaScript test harnesses: the ability
to create testing-only JavaScript modules that weren't shipped as part
of Firefox. This would encourage code reuse among tests and make writing
tests easier. I thought it would be a relatively simple feature to
implement!</p>
<p>And, it was. At first. The initial implementation landed two weeks after
I filed the bug (it didn't require too much effort, but I was busy with
others tasks). It landed without incident. Although, nothing was using
it and there was no test coverage. However, my local development started
relying on it and things were working just fine.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755196">attempted</a>
to actually land a test that made use of this new feature, it failed
because the new directory for these shared modules
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339">wasn't being archived</a>.
Simple enough to fix, right? Wrong. Start reading
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c4">bug 755339 from comment #4</a>.
It is a trail of agony. I had to uplift my change to all
the major branches. Then, once that was done, <em>buildbotcustom</em> could
be updated. Uplifts were performed on May 24. <em>buildbotcustom</em> was
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c15">pushed out to production</a>
a week later on May 31. It immediately
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c16">broke the world</a>.
At the time, philor says it was the worst tree bustage he'd ever seen.
Literally every tree was red. Achievement unlocked. A workaround
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c17">was quickly devised</a>
on May 31 (after the <em>buildbotcustom</em> change was backed out to restore
working automation) and landed. Again, it had to be uplifted to all the
trees. This patch conflicted when applied on older trees and I
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=755339#c23">accidentally committed a typo</a>
and broke beta, release, and esr in the process. I got an earful for
breaking these trees and lost a lot of <em>street cred</em> with the sheriffs
(who are charged with keeping law and order in the land of the source
trees). The <em>buildbotcustom</em> change
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757460#c21">finally landed</a>
on June 7 and stuck.</p>
<p>Finally, my initial idea of adding testing-only JavaScript modules had been
implemented and was available for all to use. It only required uplifting
a patch to all project branches, having Release Engineering reconfigure
<em>buildbotcustom</em>, and breaking all the trees in the process. This
experience was truly WTFOMGBBQ. And, the agony above was from adding a
seemingly innocuous feature to a single test harness. Can you imagine
what it's like to add a new test harness to automation?!</p>
<h3>In-tree automation configs different from Release Engineering's</h3>
<p>The above example demonstrates many shortcomings in the current
automation infrastructure. The first one I will talk about is that the
in-tree automation configs (how to perform a specific automation job,
such as run an individual test harness) are almost completely different
from what Release Engineering runs on the official infrastructure!</p>
<p>A year ago, <em>mozilla-central</em> had
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/e24391ffbe7e/testing/testsuite-targets.mk">testsuite-targets.mk</a> -
a make file defining targets like <em>xpcshell-tests</em> and
<em>mochitest-plain</em> that allowed developers to run these test suites
locally. Release Engineering had <em>buildbotcustom</em>, which didn't use
<em>testsuite-targets.mk</em> at all. While invoking most test harnesses is
simply a matter of formulating arguments for a Python script, that logic
was duplicated between <em>testsuite-targets</em> and <em>buildbotcustom</em>.</p>
<p>Today, <em>Release Engineering</em> has been porting job invocation code to
<em>mozharness</em>. And, I have been encouraging people to locally run tests
with <em>mach</em>. Initially, mach commands executed make. However, commands
are now bypassing make and calling into the Python test harnesses
natively. This allows more advanced behavior since mach has more control
and insight into the underlying test harness. The downside is mach is
now reinventing logic.</p>
<p>So, we now have 3 or 4 separate implementations for performing many of
our automation jobs. Medium term, you figure Release Engineering
consolidates all the <em>buildbotcustom</em> logic into <em>mozharness</em>,
eliminating 1. I also think it is inevitable that <em>testsuite-targets</em> is
refactored to invoke mach commands or is just removed altogether. But
that still leaves us with 2 independent implementations!</p>
<p><strong>I believe we should work towards consolidating the logic for job
invocation to inside mozilla-central.</strong> The commands developers run
locally should be as similar as possible to what runs on official
automation infrastructure. Any differences introduce potential for
different results. Differences also increase the burden to roll out
changes. I would argue that an in-tree change should be all that is
necessary to change the behavior of official automation infrastructure.</p>
<p>How this is accomplished, I'm not entirely certain. In my ideal world,
I think <em>mozharness</em> would live in tree. Although, I understand that may
not be practical because much of what <em>mozharness</em> does involves
downloading just-built packages, uploading results to a server, etc. I
think a middle ground that accomplishes most of what we seek is for the
Release Engineering configs (<em>mozharness</em>) to contain as little logic as
possible for actual job invocation and let something in-tree do the
rest. For example, the <em>mozharness</em> job for the xpcshell test harness
would simply be <em>execute the run-xpcshell-tests script from the tests
archive.</em> <em>mozilla-central</em> could then have full domain over what
exactly is done. If <em>mozilla-central</em> changes, everyone picks up those
changes immediately.</p>
<h3>Local run-time environments different from official ones</h3>
<p>Similar in vein to the previous section is that there are discrepancies
between local run-time environments and official ones. By run-time
environment, I mean the state of the operating system (installed
packages, configuration settings, etc). This plays an important role in
determining how an automation job executes. An obvious example is the
compiler toolchain. GCC 4.5 is obviously going to have different
behavior from GCC 4.7.</p>
<p>While Release Engineering has taken steps to ensure consistency in the
configuration of the machines powering the official automation
infrastructure, local machine configurations are effectively living in
the wild west. Developers are effectively unable to recreate the
official automation environment. This lowers the liklihood that a local
build will have the same outcome when performed on official automation
infrastructure.</p>
<p>While supporting diverse run-time environments will result in greater
compatibility and is thus a good thing, I think it is important that
local developers have the ability to recreate the official run-time
environment as closely as possible. This will raise confidence that
local results can be trusted and should cut down on development
cost by reducing the number of Try pushes and reducing development
cycles.</p>
<p>Recreating the official run-time environment varies in difficulty
depending on the operating system. For Linux, it should actually be
pretty easy! For the build environment, Mozilla simply needs to package
the <em>mock</em> environment used to build or at least could publish a script
used to create said environment. In
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886226">bug 886226</a>, I
made an initial stab at this by creating a Vagrantfile that will
kinda/sorta recreate the official 64-bit Linux build environment. I even
published an archive of the <em>mock</em> environment (which can be imported
into <em>Docker</em>). As pointed out on the bug, my work isn't perfect. But
it's a start. And it's better than what developers have today to
reproduce the official environments.</p>
<p>If we decide publishing archives of chroot environments is the way to
go, I believe we could extend the Linux solution to OS X as well. OS X
has chroot. It also has a sandboxing facility (<em>man sandbox</em>). There are
also tools like <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/jailkit">jailkit</a>. Also,
using chroot environments will also likely make our automation faster
since using archives will almost surely be faster than recreating the
environment on every job run.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=851294">Bug 851294</a> has
been filed to track this.</p>
<p>What about Windows? Well, I don't know. We sort of have an environment
with <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe">MozillaBuild</a>.
But, it's not isolated from the rest of the operating system like chroot
environments are. Modulo Windows, two out of three tier one platforms
isn't too bad!</p>
<p>Now, even if the software environment is similar, hardware differences
can also affect results. Unfortunately, there's little that can be done
on this front aside from having everybody use the same hardware models.
That's not going to happen. So let's pretend we don't have that problem.</p>
<h3>Configurations change over time</h3>
<p>I recently wrote a
<a href="/blog/2013/06/24/the-importance-of-time-on-automated-machine-configuration/">post on the importance of time on machine configurations</a>.
The gist is that configurations always pulling from version control tip
or relying on external resource often vary with time and aren't truly
idempotent. This makes it difficult to reproduce specific configurations
at future points in time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mozilla's build automation is highly susceptible to
configuration variance over time. There are many examples.</p>
<p>The buildbot configuration is periodically pushed to the
infrastructure. A job will inherit the config that is currently
deployed. If you make a backwards incompatible change to the buildbot
configs and push an old revision of mozilla-central, things will blow
up.</p>
<p>There are two time-dependent aspects of Puppet bootstrapping. First, the
Puppet configs (like buildbot configs) are periodically pushed to a
central master server. Whichever version is deployed at a given time is
the version picked up by the automation job. Second, we don't do a good
job of pinning versions inside the Puppet config. Here are the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mercurial.pp">Mercurial</a>,
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mock.pp">mock</a>,
and <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/puppet/file/6f7b4a33af2c/modules/packages/manifests/mozilla/py27_mercurial.pp">Python</a>
manifests using the <em>latest</em> package version. This means if a new
version of a package is added to
<a href="http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/">Mozilla's Yum repositories</a>
that new package version will be deployed on the next Puppet sync.
This is definitely not time independent. Fortunately, the base operating
system configuration for Linux isn't terribly important because of the
<em>mock</em> environment. But, it still varies.</p>
<p>Like the base operating system, the mock environment is full of
dependence on time. First, the config file itself is managed by Puppet
and thus susceptible to its time-dependent behavior. Second, the
packages installed in the mock environment aren't version pinned.
This means that whatever packages deployed in
<a href="http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/">Mozilla's Yum repositories</a>
will be used. So, every time the Yum package repository is updated, we
potentially switch the configuration of our build environment. On the
surface, this terrifies me. Maybe we have a strict update policy in
place to prevent excessive package updates. The
<a href="http://puppetagain.pub.build.mozilla.org/data/repos/yum/mirrors/centos/6/latest/os/x86_64/">modified times</a>
of packages on the server seems to indicate that. Even if we didn't
update the package repository, it still seems a bit fragile: I'd much
prefer to pin package versions everywhere than rely on the content of
a Yum server.</p>
<p>The default branch of the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools">tools repository</a>
is always checked out at build time. As new revisions are added to this
repository, builds will pick them up immediately. If you make a
backwards incompatible change to the tools repository, old revisions may
no longer build.</p>
<p>The production branch of the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozharness/">mozharness repository</a> is
always used during jobs. Again, if <em>mozharness</em> changes, every future
job sees these changes.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that many of the tightly-related
systems/repositories aren't linked in any way. The automation
configuration simply pulls the tip of each. We run into problems when we
wish to make backwards incompatible changes. If you make one, you first
have to update all repositories to be compatible. This is a huge pain
(see my experience above). Furthermore, it makes it impossible to have
successful automation runs from old revisions of those repositories!</p>
<p>The solution to this mess is to pin versions and configs everywhere.
The repositories being put through automation (namely <em>mozilla-central</em>)
should contain revisions of the configs to use. It should say <em>I want to
use revision X of mozharness, revision Y of the build machine
configuration, etc.</em> This will enable much more consistent automation
output over time. It cuts down on surprises (<em>did behavior change on July
14 because of a change to mozilla-central or to a new automation config
being rolled out to the server?</em>). It allows people to build very old
packages. This means Mozilla wouldn't need to store terabytes of old
builds around (we could just trigger the build again and get the same
output).</p>
<p>I recognize that deterministic automation configuration is likely not
completely achievable. But, that doesn't mean we shouldn't work towards
it. Having something better than today enables so many more useful
scenarios and flexibility in our automation. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Say you want to add or remove a test harness. Or, maybe you want to add
a required argument or remove an obsolute argument from a test harness.
The procedure from doing this today is far from trivial. It's not enough
to simply land your change in mozilla-central and be done with it. Instead,
you need to land support in <em>buildbotcustom</em> or <em>mozharness</em>, prepare to
land in mozilla-central, then coordinate with Release Engineering to have your
changes landed around the time of a server deployment. And since changes
likely affect multiple trees, you're likely also landing things in
inbound, fx-team, services-central, possibly aurora, beta, and release,
etc. If you aren't landing in aurora, beta, release, esr, b2g, etc, you
need to remember to have your change merged into these server configurations
when those trees inherit your code (although Release Engineering is
typically pretty good about tracking this and doing it for you).</p>
<p>Contrast this with simply making a backwards incompatible change by
checking in support in <em>mozharness</em> then making the change in
<em>mozilla-central</em> along with a revision bump of the <em>mozharness</em>
revision to use. When that changeset is pushed to the infrastructure, a
compatible version of <em>mozharness</em> is used. When that change gets merged
into other trees, the appropriate <em>mozharness</em> revision is used. No
extra work needed. Utopia. You just made A*Team and Release Engineering
much more productive by eliminating a lot of overhead.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Mozilla automation infrastructure is a complex beast. There are many
moving parts and separate systems. Any newcomer to Mozilla should simply
stand in awe that so many systems seemlessly work so well together.</p>
<p>There are improvements that can be made, sure (especially in the area of
deterministic behavior over time). But, I think with the <em>mozharness</em>
work and the <em>Puppetization</em> of the server infrastructure that Mozilla
is on the right course. I look forward to a future where the source code
in <em>mozilla-central</em> and the automation infrastructure are more tightly
integrated. We're trending there. Give it time.</p>
