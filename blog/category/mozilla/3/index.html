  <p>I think I first heard about the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstandard</a>
compression algorithm at a Mercurial developer sprint in 2015.
At one end of a large table a few people were uttering expletives out
of sheer excitement. At developer gatherings, that's the universal signal
for <em>something is awesome</em>. Long story short, a Facebook engineer shared
a link to the
<a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/">RealTime Data Compression blog</a>
operated by Yann Collet (then known as the author of LZ4 - a compression
algorithm known for its insane speeds) and people were completely
nerding out over the excellent articles and the data within showing the
beginnings of a new general purpose lossless compression algorithm named
Zstandard. It promised better-than-deflate/zlib compression ratios <strong>and</strong>
performance on both compression and decompression. This being a Mercurial
meeting, many of us were intrigued because zlib is used by Mercurial
for various functionality (including on-disk storage and compression over
the wire protocol) and zlib operations frequently appear as performance hot
spots.</p>
<p>Before I continue, if you are interested in low-level performance and
software optimization, I highly recommend perusing the
<a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/">RealTime Data Compression blog</a>.
There are some absolute nuggets of info in there.</p>
<p>Anyway, over the months, the news about Zstandard (zstd) kept getting
better and more promising. As the 1.0 release neared, the Facebook
engineers I interact with (Yann Collet - Zstandard's author - is now
employed by Facebook) were absolutely ecstatic about Zstandard and its
potential. I was toying around with pre-release versions and was
absolutely blown away by the performance and features. I believed
the hype.</p>
<p>Zstandard 1.0 was
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1658392934479273/smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard">released on August 31, 2016</a>.
A few days later, I started the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">python-zstandard</a> project to
provide a fully-featured and Pythonic interface to the underlying zstd C
API while not sacrificing safety or performance. The ulterior motive was
to leverage those bindings in Mercurial so Zstandard could be a first class
citizen in Mercurial, possibly replacing zlib as the default compression
algorithm for all operations.</p>
<p>Fast forward six months and I've achieved many of those goals.
python-zstandard has a nearly complete interface to the zstd C API.
It even exposes some primitives not in the C API, such as batch
compression operations that leverage multiple threads and use minimal
memory allocations to facilitate insanely fast execution. (Expect a
dedicated post on python-zstandard from me soon.)</p>
<p>Mercurial 4.1 ships with the python-zstandard bindings. Two Mercurial
4.1 peers talking to each other will exchange Zstandard compressed
data instead of zlib. For a Firefox repository clone, transfer size is
reduced from ~1184 MB (zlib level 6) to ~1052 MB (zstd level 3) in the
default Mercurial configuration while using ~60% of the CPU that zlib
required on the compressor end. When cloning from hg.mozilla.org, the
pre-generated zstd <em>clone bundle</em> hosted on a CDN using maximum
compression is ~707 MB - ~60% the size of zlib! And, work is ongoing
for Mercurial to support Zstandard for on-disk storage, which should
bring considerable performance wins over zlib for local operations.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot working on python-zstandard and integrating Zstandard
into Mercurial. My primary takeaway is <strong>Zstandard is awesome</strong>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to extol the virtues of Zstandard and provide
reasons why I think you should use it.</p>
<h2>Why Zstandard</h2>
<p>The main objective of lossless compression is to spend one resource
(CPU) so that you may reduce another (I/O). This trade-off is usually
made because data - either at rest in storage or in motion over a
network or even through a machine via software and memory - is a
limiting factor for performance. So if compression is needed for your
use case to mitigate I/O being the limiting resource and you can swap
in a different compression algorithm that magically reduces both CPU
and I/O requirements, that's pretty exciting. At scale, better
and more efficient compression can translate to substantial cost
savings in infrastructure. It can also lead to improved application
performance, translating to better end-user engagement, sales,
productivity, etc. This is why companies like Facebook (Zstandard),
Google (brotli, snappy, zopfli), and
<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pied-piper">Pied Piper</a>
(middle-out) invest in compression.</p>
<p>Today, the most widely used compression algorithm in the world is
likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE">DEFLATE</a>. And, software
most often interacts with DEFLATE via what is likely the most widely
used software library in the world, <a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a>.</p>
<p>Being at least 27 years old, DEFLATE is getting a bit long in the
tooth. Computers are completely different today than they were in 1990.
The Pentium microprocessor debuted in 1993. If memory serves (pun
intended), it used PC66 DRAM, which had a transfer rate of 533 MB/s.
For comparison, a modern NVMe M.2 SSD (like the Samsung 960 PRO)
can read at 3000+ MB/s and write at 2000+ MB/s. In other words,
persistent storage today is faster than the RAM from the era when
DEFLATE was invented. And of course CPU and network speeds have
increased as well. We also have completely different instruction
sets on CPUs for well-designed algorithms and software to take
advantage of. What I'm trying to say is the market is ripe for
DEFLATE and zlib to be dethroned by algorithms and software that
take into account the realities of modern computers.</p>
<p>(For the remainder of this post I'll use <em>zlib</em> as a stand-in for
<em>DEFLATE</em> because it is simpler.)</p>
<p>Zstandard initially piqued my attention by promising better-than-zlib
compression and performance in both the compression and decompression
directions. That's impressive. But it isn't unique. Brotli achieves
the same, for example. But what kept my attention was Zstandard's rich
feature set, tuning abilities, and therefore versatility.</p>
<p>In the sections below, I'll describe some of the benefits of Zstandard
in more detail.</p>
<p>Before I do, I need to throw in an obligatory disclaimer about data
and numbers that I use. Benchmarking is hard. Benchmarks should not
be trusted. There are so many variables that can influence performance
and benchmarks. (A recent example that surprised me is the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1323106">CPU frequency/power ramping properties of Xeon versus non-Xeon Intel CPUs</a>.
tl;dr a Xeon won't hit max CPU frequency if only a core or two
is busy, meaning that any single or low-threaded benchmark is
likely misleading on Xeons unless you change power settings to
mitigate its conservative power ramping defaults. And if you change
power settings, does that reflect real-life usage?)</p>
<p>Reporting useful and accurate performance numbers for compression is
hard because there are so many variables to care about. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every corpus is different. Text, JSON, C++, photos, numerical data,
  etc all exhibit different properties when fed into compression and
  could cause compression ratios or speeds to vary significantly.</li>
<li>Few large inputs versus many smaller inputs (some algorithms work
  better on large inputs; some libraries have high per-operation
  overhead).</li>
<li>Memory allocation and use strategy. Performance can vary
  significantly depending on how a compression library allocates,
  manages, and uses memory. This can be an implementation specific
  detail as opposed to a core property of the compression algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Mercurial is the driver for my work in Zstandard, the data and
numbers I report in this post are mostly Mercurial data. Specifically,
I'll be referring to data in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified">mozilla-unified Firefox repository</a>.
This repository contains over 300,000 commits spanning almost 10 years.
The data within is a good mix of text (mostly C++, JavaScript, Python,
HTML, and CSS source code and other free-form text) and binary (like
PNGs). The Mercurial layer adds some binary structures to e.g. represent
metadata for deltas, diffs, and patching. There are two Mercurial-specific
pieces of data I will use. One is a Mercurial <em>bundle</em>. This is essentially
a representation of all data in a repository. It stores a mix of raw,
fulltext data and deltas on that data. For the mozilla-unified repo, an
uncompressed bundle (produced via <code>hg bundle -t none-v2 -a</code>) is ~4457 MB.
The other piece of data is <em>revlog chunks</em>. This is a mix of fulltext
and delta data for a specific item tracked in version control. I
frequently use the <em>changelog</em> corpus, which is the fulltext data
describing changesets or commits to Firefox. The numbers quoted and
used for charts in this post
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHhGxsQR3zDE-2Eeu5Hn2t-UKw4oGV-7LQTMGEdBh9U/edit?usp=sharing">are available in a Google Sheet</a>.</p>
<p>All performance data was obtained on an i7-6700K running Ubuntu 16.10
(Linux 4.8.0) with a mostly stock config. Benchmarks were performed in
memory to mitigate storage I/O or filesystem interference. Memory used
is DDR4-2133 with a cycle time of 35 clocks.</p>
<p>While I'm pretty positive about Zstandard, it isn't perfect. There are
corpora for which Zstandard performs worse than other algorithms, even
ones I compare it directly to in this post. So, your mileage may vary.
Please enlighten me with your counterexamples by leaving a comment.</p>
<p>With that (rather large) disclaimer out of the way, let's talk about
what makes Zstandard awesome.</p>
<h2>Flexibility for Speed Versus Size Trade-offs</h2>
<p>Compression algorithms typically contain parameters to control how
much work to do. You can choose to spend more CPU to (hopefully)
achieve better compression or you can spend less CPU to sacrifice
compression. (OK, fine, there are other factors like memory usage at
play too. I'm simplifying.) This is commonly exposed to
end-users as a compression <em>level</em>. (In reality there are often
multiple parameters that can be tuned. But I'll just use <em>level</em>
as a stand-in to represent the concept.)</p>
<p>But even with adjustable compression levels, the performance of many
compression algorithms and libraries tend to fall within a relatively
narrow window. In other words, many compression algorithms focus on
niche markets. For example, LZ4 is super fast but doesn't yield great
compression ratios. LZMA yields terrific compression ratios but is
extremely slow.</p>
<p>This can be visualized in the following chart showing results when
compressing a mozilla-unified Mercurial bundle:</p>
<p><img alt="bundle compression with common algorithms" src="/images/compression-bundle-common.png" /></p>
<p>This chart plots the logarithmic compression speed in megabytes per
second against achieved compression ratio. The further right a data
point is, the better the compression and the smaller the output.
The higher up a point is, the faster compression is.</p>
<p>The ideal compression algorithm lives in the top right, which means
it compresses well and is fast. But the powers of mathematics push
compression algorithms away from the top right.</p>
<p>On to the observations.</p>
<p>LZ4 is highly vertical, which means its compression ratios are
limited in variance but it is extremely flexible in speed. So for
this data, you might as well stick to a lower compression level
because higher values don't buy you much.</p>
<p>Bzip2 is the opposite: a horizontal line. That means it is consistently
the same speed while yielding different compression ratios. In other
words, you might as well crank bzip2 up to maximum compression because
it doesn't have a significant adverse impact on speed.</p>
<p>LZMA and zlib are more interesting because they exhibit more variance
in both the compression ratio and speed dimensions. But let's be frank,
they are still pretty narrow. LZMA looks pretty good from a shape
perspective, but its top speed is just too slow - only ~26 MB/s!</p>
<p>This small window of flexibility means that you often have to choose
a compression algorithm based on the speed versus size trade-off you are
willing to make at that time. That choice often gets baked into
software. And as time passes and your software or data gains popularity,
changing the software to swap in or support a new compression algorithm
becomes harder because of the cost and disruption it will cause. That's
technical debt.</p>
<p>What we really want is a single compression algorithm that occupies
lots of <em>space</em> in both dimensions of our chart - a curve that has
high variance in both compression speed and ratio. Such an algorithm
would allow you to make an easy decision choosing a compression
algorithm without locking you into a narrow behavior profile. It would
allow you make a completely different size versus speed trade-off in
the future by only adjusting a config knob or two in your application -
no swapping of compression algorithms needed!</p>
<p>As you can guess, Zstandard fulfills this role. This can clearly be seen
in the following chart (which also adds brotli for comparison).</p>
<p><img alt="bundle compression with modern algorithms" src="/images/compression-bundle-modern.png" /></p>
<p>The advantages of Zstandard (and brotli) are obvious. Zstandard's
compression speeds go from ~338 MB/s at level 1 to ~2.6 MB/s at
level 22 while covering compression ratios from 3.72 to 6.05. On one
end, <strong>zstd level 1 is ~3.4x faster than zlib level 1 while achieving
better compression than zlib level 9!</strong> That fastest speed is only 2x
slower than LZ4 level 1. On the other end of the spectrum, zstd
level 22 runs ~1 MB/s slower than LZMA at level 9 and produces a
file that is only 2.3% larger.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that zstd's C API exposes several knobs for tweaking
the compression algorithm. Each compression level maps to a pre-defined
set of values for these knobs. It is possible to set these values beyond
the ranges exposed by the default compression levels 1 through 22. I've
done some basic experimentation with this and have made compression even
faster (while sacrificing ratio, of course). This covers the gap between
Zstandard and brotli on this end of the tuning curve.</p>
<p>The wide span of compression speeds and ratios is a game changer
for compression. Unless you have special requirements such as
lightning fast operations (which LZ4 can provide) or special
corpora that Zstandard can't handle well, Zstandard is a very safe and
flexible choice for general purpose compression.</p>
<h2>Multi-threaded Compression</h2>
<p>Zstd 1.1.3 contains a multi-threaded compression API that allows a
compression operation to leverage multiple threads. The output from
this API is compatible with the Zstandard frame format and doesn't require
any special handling on the decompression side. <strong>In other words, a
compressor can switch to the multi-threaded API and decompressors won't
care.</strong></p>
<p>This is a big deal for a few reasons. First, today's advancements in
computer processors tend to yield more capacity from more cores not
from faster clocks and better cycle efficiency (although many cases
do benefit greatly from modern instruction sets like AVX and therefore
better cycle efficiency). Second, so many compression libraries are
only single-threaded and require consumers to invent their own framing
formats or storage models to facilitate multi-threading. (See
<a href="http://blosc.org/">Blosc</a> for such a library.) Lack of a
multi-threaded API in the compression library means trusting another
piece of software or writing your own multi-threaded code.</p>
<p>The following chart adds a plot of Zstandard multi-threaded compression
with 4 threads.</p>
<p><img alt="multi-threaded compression" src="/images/compression-bundle-multithreaded.png" /></p>
<p>The existing curve for Zstandard basically shifted straight up. Nice!</p>
<p>The ~338 MB/s speed for single-threaded compression on zstd level 1
increases to ~1,376 MB/s with 4 threads. That's ~4.06x faster. And,
it is ~2.26x faster than the previous fastest entry, LZ4 at level 1!
The output size only increased by ~4 MB or ~0.3% over single-threaded
compression.</p>
<p>The scaling properties for multi-threaded compression on this input
are terrific: all 4 cores are saturated and the output size barely
changed.</p>
<p>Because Zstandard's multi-threaded compression API produces data compatible
with any Zstandard decompressor, it can logically be considered an extension
of <em>compression levels</em>. This means that the already extremely flexible
speed vs ratio curve becomes even wider in the speed axis. Zstandard
was already a justifiable choice with its extreme versatility. But when
you throw in native multi-threaded compression API support, the
flexibility for tuning compression performance is just absurd. With
enough cores, you are likely to run into I/O limits long before you
exhaust the CPU, at which point you can crank up the compression
level and sacrifice as much CPU as you are willing to burn. That's
a good position to be in.</p>
<h2>Decompression Speed</h2>
<p>Compression speed and ratios only tell half the story about a compression
algorithm. Except for archiving scenarios where you write once and
read rarely, you probably care about decompression performance.</p>
<p>Popular compression algorithms like zlib and bzip2 have less than stellar
decompression speeds. On my i7-6700K, zlib decompression can deliver many
decompressed data sets at the output end at 200+ MB/s. However, on the
input/compressed end, it frequently fails to reach 100 MB/s or even
80 MB/s. This is significant because if your application is reading data
over a 1 Gbps network or from a local disk (modern SSDs can read at several
hundred MB/s or more), then your application has a CPU bottleneck at
decoding the data - and that's before you actually do anything useful
with the data in the application layer! (Remember: the idea behind
compression is to spend CPU to mitigate an I/O bottleneck. So if
compression makes you CPU bound, you've undermined the point of
compression!) And if my Skylake CPU running at 4.0 GHz is CPU -
not I/O - bound, A Xeon in a data center will be even slower and
even more CPU bound (Xeons tend to run at much lower clock speeds -
the laws of thermodynamics require that in order to run more cores in
the package). In short, <strong>if you are using zlib for high throughput
scenarios, there's a good chance it is a bottleneck and slowing down
your application</strong>.</p>
<p>We again measure the speed of algorithms using a Firefox Mercurial
bundle. The following charts plot decompression speed versus ratio
for this file. The first chart measures decompression speed on the
input end of the decompressor. The second measures speed at the
output end.</p>
<p><img alt="decompression input" src="/images/decompression-bundle-input.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="decompression output" src="/images/decompression-bundle-output.png" /></p>
<p>Zstandard matches its great compression speed with great decompression
speed. Zstandard can deliver decompressed output at 1000+ MB/s while
consuming input at 200-275MB/s. Furthermore, decompression speed is
mostly independent of the compression level. (Although higher
compression levels require more memory in the decompressor.) So, <strong>if
you want to throw more CPU at re-compression later so data at rest takes
less space, you can do that without sacrificing read performance.</strong>
I haven't done the math, but there is probably a break-even point
where having dedicated machines re-compress terabytes or petabytes
of data at rest offsets the costs of those machine through reduced
storage costs.</p>
<p>While Zstandard is not as fast decompressing as LZ4 (which can consume
compressed input at 500+ MB/s), its performance is often ~4x faster
than zlib. On many CPUs, this puts it well above 1 Gbps, which is
often desirable to avoid a bottleneck at the network layer.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that while Zstandard and brotli were comparable
on the compression half of this data, Zstandard has a clear advantage
doing decompression.</p>
<p>Finally, you don't appear to pay a price for multi-threaded Zstandard
compression on the decompression side (<code>zstdmt</code> in the chart).</p>
<h2>Dictionary Support</h2>
<p>The examples so far in this post have used a single 4,457 MB piece of
input data to measure behavior. Large data can behave completely
differently from small data. This is because so much of what
compression algorithms do is find patterns that came before so incoming
data can be <em>referenced</em> to old data instead of uniquely stored. And if
data is small, there isn't much of it that came before to reference!</p>
<p>This is often why many small, independent chunks of input compress
poorly compared to a single large chunk. This can be demonstrated by
comparing the widely-used <em>zip</em> and <em>tar</em> archive formats. On the
surface, both do the same thing: they are a container of files. But
they employ compression at different phases. A <em>zip</em> file will zlib
compress each entry independently. However, a <em>tar</em> file doesn't use
compression internally. Instead, the tar file itself is fed into a
compression algorithm and compressed as a whole.</p>
<p>We can observe the difference on real world data. Firefox
ships with a file named <code>omni.ja</code>. Despite the weird extension, this
is a <em>zip</em> file. The file contains most of the assets for non-compiled
code used by Firefox. This includes the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
images that power many parts of the Firefox frontend. The file weighs
in at 9,783,749 bytes for the 64-bit Windows Firefox Nightly from
2017-03-06. (Or 9,965,793 bytes when using <code>zip -9</code> - the code for
generating <code>omni.ja</code> is smarter than <code>zip</code> and creates smaller
files.) But a zlib level 9 compressed <code>tar.gz</code> file of that directory
is 8,627,155 bytes. That 1,156KB / 13% size difference is significant
when you are talking about delivering bits to end users! (In this
case, the content within the archive needs to be individually
addressable to facilitate fast access to any item without having
to decompress the entire archive: this matters for performance.)</p>
<p>A more extreme example of the differences between <em>zip</em> and <em>tar</em>
is the files in the Firefox source checkout. On revision
a08ec245fa24 of the Firefox Mercurial repository, a <em>zip</em> file of
all files in version control is 430,446,549 bytes versus
322,916,403 bytes for a <em>tar.gz</em> file (1,177,430,383 bytes uncompressed
spanning 180,912 files). Using Zstandard, compressing each file
discretely at compression level 3 yields 391,387,299 bytes of
compressed data versus 294,926,418 as a single stream (without the
<em>tar</em> container). Same compression algorithm. Different application
method. Drastically different results. That's the impact of input
size on compression performance.</p>
<p>While the compression ratio and speed of a single large stream is
often better than multiple smaller chunks, there are still
use cases that either don't have enough data or prefer independent
access to each piece of input (like Firefox's <code>omni.ja</code> file). So
a robust compression algorithm should handle small inputs as well
as it does large inputs.</p>
<p>Zstandard helps offset the inherent inefficiencies of small inputs
by supporting <em>dictionary compression</em>. A <em>dictionary</em> is
essentially data used to seed the compressor's state. If the
compressor sees data that exists in the dictionary, it references
the dictionary instead of storing new data in the compressed output
stream. This results in smaller output sizes and better compression
ratios. One drawback to this is the dictionary has to be used to
decompress data, which means you need to figure out how to
distribute the dictionary and ensure it remains in sync with all
data producers and consumers. This isn't always trivial.</p>
<p>Dictionary compression only works if there is enough repeated data
and patterns in the inputs that can be extracted to yield a
useful dictionary. Examples of this include markup languages, source
code, or pieces of similar data (such as JSON payloads from HTTP API
requests or telemetry data), which often have many repeated keywords
and patterns.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are typically produced by <em>training</em> them on existing
data. Essentially, you feed a bunch of samples into an algorithm
that spits out a meaningful and useful dictionary. The more coherency
in the data that will be compressed, the better the dictionary and
the better the compression ratios.</p>
<p>Dictionaries can have a significant effect on compression ratios and
speed.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Firefox's <code>omni.ja</code> file. Compressing each file
discretely at zstd level 12 yields 9,177,410 bytes of data. But if
we produce a 131,072 byte dictionary by training it on all files
within <code>omni.ja</code>, the total size of each file compressed discretely
is 7,942,886 bytes. Including the dictionary, the total size is
8,073,958 bytes, 1,103,452 bytes smaller than non-dictionary
compression! (The zlib-based <code>omni.ja</code> is 9,783,749 bytes.) So
Zstandard plus dictionary compression would likely yield a
meaningful ~1.5 MB size reduction to the <code>omni.ja</code> file. This would
make the Firefox distribution smaller and <em>may</em> improve startup
time (since many files inside <code>omni.ja</code> are accessed at
startup), which would make a number of people very happy. (Of
course, Firefox doesn't yet contain the zstd C library. And adding
it just for this use case may not make sense. But Firefox does ship
with the brotli library and brotli supports dictionary compression
and has similar performance characteristics as Zstandard, so, uh,
someone may want to look into transitioning <code>omni.jar</code> to
<em>not zlib</em>.)</p>
<p>But the benefits of dictionary compression don't end at compression
ratios: operations with dictionaries can be faster as well!</p>
<p>The following chart shows performance when compressing Mercurial
<em>changeset</em> data (describes a Mercurial commit) for the Firefox
repository. There are 382,530 discrete inputs spanning 221,429,458
bytes (mean: 579 bytes, median: 306 bytes). (Note: measurements were
conducted in Python and therefore may introduce some overhead.)</p>
<p><img alt="dictionary compression performance" src="/images/decompression-dictionary-changeset.png" /></p>
<p>Aside from zstd level 3 dictionary compression, Zstandard is faster
than zlib level 6 across the board (I suspect this one-off is an
oddity with the zstd compression parameters at this level and this
corpus because zstd level 4 is faster than level 3, which is weird).</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that non-dictionary zstandard compression
has similar compression ratios to zlib. Again, this demonstrates
the intrinsic difficulties of compressing small inputs.</p>
<p>But the real takeaway from this data are the speed differences with
dictionary compression enabled. Dictionary decompression is
2.2-2.4x <em>faster</em> than non-dictionary decompression. Already
respectable ~240 MB/s decompression speed (measured at the output
end) becomes ~530 MB/s. Zlib level 6 was ~140 MB/s, so swapping
in dictionary compression makes things ~3.8x faster. It takes ~1.5s
of CPU time to zlib decompress this corpus. So if Mercurial can
be taught to use Zstandard dictionary compression for changelog data,
certain operations on this corpus will complete ~1.1s faster. That's
significant.</p>
<p>It's worth stating that Zstandard isn't the only compression algorithm
or library to support dictionary compression. Brotli and zlib do as
well, for example. But, Zstandard's support for dictionary compression
seems to be more polished than other libraries I've seen. It has multiple
APIs for training dictionaries from sample data. (Brotli has none nor
does brotli's documentation say how to generate dictionaries as far as
I can tell.)</p>
<p>Dictionary compression is definitely an advanced feature, applicable
only to certain use cases (lots of small, similar data). But there's
no denying that if you can take advantage of dictionary compression,
you may be rewarded with significant performance wins.</p>
<h2>A Versatile C API</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of my time these days in higher-level programming
languages like Python and JavaScript. By the time you interact with
compression in high-level languages, the low-level compression APIs
provided by the compression library are most likely hidden from you
and bundled in a nice, friendly abstraction, suitable for a
higher-level language. And more often than not, many features of
that low-level API are not exposed for you to call. So, you don't
get an appreciation for how good (or bad) or feature rich (or
lacking) the low-level API is.</p>
<p>As part of writing
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">python-zstandard</a>, I've
spent a lot of time interfacing with the zstd C API. And, as part
of evaluating other compression libraries for use in Mercurial, I've
been looking at C APIs for other libraries and the Python bindings to
them. A takeaway from this is an appreciation for the quality of
zstd's C API.</p>
<p>Many compression library APIs are either too simple or too complex.
Zstandard's is in the Goldilocks zone. Aside from a few minor missing
features, its C API was more than adequate in its 1.0 release.</p>
<p>What I really appreciate about the zstd C API is that it provides
high, medium, and low-level APIs. From the highest level, you throw
it pointers to input and output buffers and it does an operation.
From the medium level, you use a reusable <em>context</em> holding state
and other parameters and it does an operation. From the low-level,
you are calling multiple functions and shuffling bytes around,
maintaining your own state and potentially bypassing the Zstandard
<em>framing</em> format in the process. The different levels give you
almost total control over everything. This is critical for performance
optimization and when writing bindings for higher-level languages that
may have different expectations on the behavior of software. The
performance I've achieved in python-zstandard just isn't (easily)
possible with other compression libraries because of their lacking
API design.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when interacting with a C library I think <em>if only there
were a function to let me do X my life would be much easier</em>. I
rarely have this experience with Zstandard. The C API is well thought out,
has almost all the features I want/need, and is pretty easy to use.
While most won't notice this difference, it should be a significant
advantage for Zstandard in the long run, as more bindings are
written and more people have a high-quality experience with it
because the C API allows them to.</p>
<h2>Zstandard Isn't Perfect</h2>
<p>I've been pretty positive about Zstandard so far in this post.
In fear of sounding like a fanboy who is so blinded by admiration
that he can't see faults and because nothing is perfect, I need to
point out some negatives about Zstandard. (Aside: put little faith
in the words uttered by someone who can't find a fault in something
they praise.)</p>
<p>First, the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/3bee41a70eaf343fbcae3637b3f6edbe52f35ed8/doc/zstd_compression_format.md#zstandard-frames">framing format</a>
is a bit heavyweight in some scenarios. The frame header is at <em>least</em>
6 bytes. For input of 256-65791 bytes, recording the original source
size and its checksum will result in a 12 byte frame. Zlib, by contrast,
is only 6 bytes for this scenario. When storing tens of thousands of
compressed records (this is a use case in Mercurial), the frame overhead
can matter and this can make it difficult for compressed Zstandard
data to be as small as zlib for very small inputs. (It's worth noting
that zlib doesn't store the decompressed size in its header. There are
pros and cons to this, which I'll discuss in my eventual post about
python-zstandard and how it achieves optimal performance.) If the frame
overhead matters to you, the zstd C API does expose a <em>block</em> API that
operates at a level below the framing format, allowing you to roll your
own framing protocol. I also
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/591">filed a GitHub issue</a> to
make the 4 byte magic number optional, which would go a long way to
cutting down on frame overhead.</p>
<p>Second, the C API is not yet fully stabilized. There are a number of
functions marked as <em>experimental</em> that aren't exported from the shared
library and are only available via static linking. There's a ton of
useful functionality in there, including low-level compression parameter
adjustment, digested dictionaries (for reusing computed dictionaries
across multiple <em>contexts</em>), and the multi-threaded compression API.
python-zstandard makes heavy use of these <em>experimental</em> APIs. This
requires bundling zstd with python-zstandard and statically linking
with this known version because functionality could change at any time.
This is a bit annoying, especially for distro packagers.</p>
<p>Third, the low-level compression parameters are under-documented. I
think I understand what a lot of them do. But it isn't obvious when
I should consider adjusting what. The default compression levels
seem to work pretty well and map to reasonable compression parameters.
But a few times I've noticed that tweaking things slightly can result
in desirable improvements. I wish there were a guide of sorts to
help you tune these parameters.</p>
<p>Fourth, dictionary compression is still a bit too complicated and
hand-wavy for my liking. I can measure obvious benefits when using it
largely out of the box with some corpora. But it isn't always a win
and the cost for training dictionaries is too high to justify using
it outside of scenarios where you are pretty sure it will be beneficial.
When I do use it, I'm not sure which compression levels it works best
with, how many samples need to be fed into the dictionary trainer,
which training algorithm to use, etc. If that isn't enough, there is
also the concept of <em>content-only dictionaries</em> where you use a
fulltext as the dictionary. This can be useful for delta-encoding
schemes (where compression effectively acts like a diff/delta
generator instead of using something like Myers diff). If this topic
interests you, there is a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2017-January/092186.html">thread on the Mercurial developers list</a>
where Yann Collet and I discuss this.</p>
<p>Fifth, the patent rights grant. There is some
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/4ded9e591cbed57c54fc8f7a50412af5980e23a7/PATENTS#L14">wording in the PATENTS file</a>
in the Zstandard project that may... concern lawyers. While Zstandard
is covered by the standard BSD 3-Clause license, that supplemental
<code>PATENTS</code> file may scare some lawyers enough that you won't be able
to use Zstandard. You may want to talk to a lawyer before using
Zstandard, especially if you or your company likes initiating patent
lawsuits against companies (or wishes to reserve that right - as many
companies do), as that is the condition upon which the license
terminates. Note that there is a long history between Facebook and
consumers of its open source software regarding this language in the
<code>PATENTS</code> file. Do a search for <code>React patent grant</code> to read more.</p>
<p>Sixth and finally, Zstandard is still relatively new. I can totally
relate to holding off until something new and shiny proves itself.
That being said, the Zstandard framing protocol has some escape
hatches for future needs. And, the project proved during its pre-1.0
days that it knows how to handle backwards and future compatibility
issues. And considering Facebook and others are using Zstandard in
production, I wouldn't be too worried. I think the biggest risk is
to people (like me) who are writing code against the <em>experimental</em>
C APIs. But even then, the changes to the experimental APIs in the
past several months have been minor. I'm not losing sleep over it.</p>
<p>That may seem like a long and concerning list. Most of the issues are
relatively minor. The language in the <code>PATENTS</code> file may be a
showstopper to some. From my perspective, the biggest thing Zstandard has
going against it is its youth. But that will only improve with age.
While I'm usually pretty conservative about adopting new technology
(I've gotten burned enough times that I prefer the neophytes do the
field testing for me), the upside to using Zstandard is potentially
drastic performance and efficiency gains. And that can translate to
success versus failure or millions of dollars in saved infrastructure
costs and productivity gains. I'm willing to take my chances.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For the corpora I've thrown at it, Zstandard handily outperforms zlib
in almost every dimension. And, it even manages to best other <em>modern</em>
compression algorithms like brotli in many tests.</p>
<p>The underlying algorithm and techniques used by Zstandard are highly
parameterized, lending themselves to a variety of use cases from embedded
hardware to massive data crunching machines with hundreds of gigabytes
of memory and dozens of CPU cores.</p>
<p>The C API is well-designed and facilitates high performance and
adaptability to numerous use cases. It is <em>batteries included</em>,
providing functions to train dictionaries and perform multi-threaded
compression.</p>
<p>Zstandard is backed by Facebook and seems to have a healthy open source
culture <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">on Github</a>. My interactions
with Yann Collet have been positive and he seems to be a great
project maintainer.</p>
<p>Zstandard is an exciting advancement for data compression and therefore
for the entire computing field. As someone who has lived in the world
of zlib for years, was a casual user of compression, and thought zlib
was <em>good enough</em> for most use cases, I can attest that Zstandard is
game changing. After being enlightened to all the advantages of
Zstandard, I'll never casually use zlib again: it's just too slow and
inflexible for the needs of modern computing. If you use compression,
I highly recommend investigating Zstandard.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The Internet went crazy on Thursday when Google
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">announced a SHA-1 collision</a>.
This has spawned a lot of talk about the impact of SHA-1 in version
control. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Git) weighed in on the
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=148787047422954">Git mailing list</a> and on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/7tp2gYWQugL">Google+</a>.
There are also posts like
<a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2017-February/031623.html">SHA1 collisions make Git vulnerable to attakcs by third-parties, not just repo maintainers</a>
outlining the history of Git and SHA-1. On the Mercurial side,
Matt Mackall (the creator of Mercurial) authored a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">SHA-1 and Mercurial security article</a>.
(If you haven't read Matt's article, please do so now before
continuing.)</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute my own take on the problem with a slant towards
Mercurial and while also comparing Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1
collisions to Git's. Since this is a security topic, I'd like to
explicitly state that I'm not a cryptographer. However, I've worked on
a number of software components that do security/cryptography (like
Firefox Sync) and I'm pretty confident saying that my grasp on
cryptographic primitives and security techniques is better than the
average developer's.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions on a technical
level.</p>
<p>Mercurial, like Git, is <em>vulnerable</em> to SHA-1 collisions. Mercurial is
vulnerable because its logical storage mechanism (like Git's) indexes
tracked content by SHA-1. If two objects with differing content have the
same SHA-1, content under version control could be changed and detecting
that would be difficult or impossible. That's obviously bad.</p>
<p>But, Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions isn't as severe as Git's.
To understand why, we have to understand how each stores data.</p>
<p>Git's logical storage model is a content-addressable key-value store.
Values (<em>objects</em> in Git parlance) consist of a header identifying the
object type (commit, tree, blob, or tag), the size of the data (as a
string), and the raw content of the thing being stored. Common content
types are file content (blob), a list of files (tree), and a description
of a commit (commit). Keys in this blob store are SHA-1 hashes of objects.
All Git objects go into a single <em>namespace</em> in the Git repository's
<em>store</em>. A beneficial side-effect of this is data de-duplication: if the
same file is added to a Git repository, it's <em>blob</em> object will be
identical and it will only be stored once by Git. A detrimental
side-effect is that hash collisions are possible between any two objects,
irregardless of their type or location in the repository.</p>
<p>Mercurial's logical storage model is also content-addressable. However,
it is significantly different from Git's approach. Mercurial's logical
storage model allocates a separate sub-store for each tracked <em>path</em>.
If you run <code>find .hg/store -name '*.i'</code> inside a Mercurial repository,
you'll see these files. There is a separate file for each path
that has committed data. If you <code>hg add foo.txt</code> and <code>hg commit</code>, there
will be a <code>data/foo.txt.i</code> file holding data for <code>foo.txt</code>.
There are also special files <code>00changelog.i</code> and <code>00manifest.i</code> holding
data for commits/changesets and file lists, respectively. Each of these
<code>.i</code> files - a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/a185b903bda3/mercurial/help/internals/revlogs.txt">revlog</a> -
is roughly equivalent to an ordered collection of Git objects for a
specific tracked path. This means that Mercurial's store consists of
N discrete and independent namespaces for data. Contrast with Git's
single namespace.</p>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks are the opposite of those pointed out for
Git above: Mercurial doesn't have automatic content-based de-duplication
but it does provide some defense against hash collisions. Because each
logical path is independent of all others, a Mercurial repository will
happily commit two files with different content but same hashes. This
is more robust than Git because a hash collision is isolated to a single
logical path / revlog. In other words, a random file added to the
repository in directory <code>X</code> that has a hash collision with a file in
directory <code>Y</code> won't cause problems.</p>
<p>Mercurial also differs significantly from Git in terms of how the hash
is obtained. Git's hash is computed from raw content preceded by a header
derived directly from the object's role and size. (Takeaway: the header is
static and can be derived trivially.) Mercurial's hash is computed from
raw content preceded by a header. But that header consists of the 20 byte
SHA-1 hash(es) of the parent revisions in the revlog to which the content
is being added. This <em>chaining</em> of hashes means that the header is not
always static nor always trivially derived. This means that the same
content can be stored in the revlog under multiple hashes. It also means
that it is possible to store differing content having a hash collision
within the same revlog! But only under some conditions - Mercurial will
still barf in some scenarios if there is a hash collision within content
tracked by the revlog. This is different from Git's behavior, where the
same content <em>always</em> results in the same Git object hash. (It's worth
noting that a SHA-1 collision on data with a Git object header has not
yet been encountered in the wild.)</p>
<p>The takeaway from the above paragraphs is Mercurial's storage model
is slightly more robust against hash collisions than Git's because there
are multiple, isolated namespaces for storing content and because all
hashes are chained to previous content. So, when SHA-1 collisions
are more achievable and someone manages to create a collision for a
hash used by version control, Mercurial's storage layer will be able
to cope with that better than Git's.</p>
<p>But the concern about SHA-1 weakness is more about security than storage
robustness. The disaster scenario for version control is that an
attacker could replace content under version control, possibly
undetected. If one can generate a hash collision, then this is
possible. Mercurial's chaining of content provides some defense, but
it isn't sufficient.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">Matt Mackall</a>
that at the present time there are bigger concerns with content
safety than SHA-1 collisions. Namely, if you are an attacker, it is
much easier to introduce a subtle bug that contains a security
vulnerability than to introduce a SHA-1 collision. It is also
much easier to hack the canonical version control server (or any
user or automated agent that has permissions to push to the server)
and add a <em>bad</em> commit. Many projects don't have adequate defenses
to detect such <em>bad</em> commits. Ask yourself: if a bad actor pushed
a <em>bad</em> commit to my repository, would it be detected? Keep in mind
that spoofing author and committer metadata in commits is trivial.
<strong>The current state of Mercurial and Git rely primarily on trust -
not SHA-1 hashes - as their primary defense against malicious
actors.</strong></p>
<p>The desire to move away from SHA-1 has been on the radar of the
Mercurial project for years. For 10+ years, the <em>revlog</em> data
structure has allocated 32 bytes for hashes while only using 20 bytes
for SHA-1. And, the topic of SHA-1 weakness and desire to move to
something stronger has come up at the developer <em>sprints</em> for the
past several years. However, it has never been pressing enough to act
on because <em>there are bigger problems</em>. If it were easy to change, then
Mercurial likely would have done it already. But changing is not easy.
As soon as you introduce a new hash format in a repository, you've
potentially locked out all legacy versions of the Mercurial software
from accessing the repository (unless the repository stores multiple
hashes and allows legacy clients to access the legacy SHA-1 hashes).
There are a number of concerns from legacy compatibility (something
Mercurial cares deeply about) to user experience to even performance
(SHA-1 hashing even at 1000+MB/s floats to the top of performance
profiling for some Mercurial operations). I'm sure the topic will be
discussed heavily at the upcoming developers sprint in a few weeks.</p>
<p>While Mercurial should (and will eventually) replace SHA-1, I think
the biggest improvement Mercurial (or Git for that matter) can make
to repository <em>security</em> is providing a better mechanism for tracking
and auditing trust. Existing mechanisms for GPG signing every commit
aren't practical or are a non-starer for many workflows. And, they
rely on GPG, which has notorious end-user usability problems. (I would
prefer my version control tool not subject me to toiling with GPG.)
I've thought about this topic considerably, authoring a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitSigningPlan">proposal for easier and more flexible commit signing</a>.
There is also a related proposal to establish a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitCustodyConcept">cryptographically meaningful chain-of-custody for a patch</a>.
There are some good ideas there. But, like all user-facing
cryptography, the devil is in the details. There are some hard
problems to solve, like how to manage/store public keys that were
used for signatures. While there is some prior art in version control
tools (see Monotone), it is far from a solved problem. And at the
end of the day, you are still left having to trust a set of keys
used to produce signatures.</p>
<p>While version control can keep using cryptographically strong hashes
to mitigate collisions within its storage layer to prevent content
swapping and can employ cryptographic signatures of tracked data,
there is still the issue of trust. Version control can give you the
tools for establishing and auditing trust. Version control can also
provide tools for managing trust relationships. But at the end of the
day, the actual act of trusting trust boils down to people making
decisions (possibly through corporate or project policies). This
will always be a weak link. Therefore, it's what malicious actors
will attack. The best your version control tool can do is give its
users the capability and tools to run a secure and verifiable
repository so that when bad content is inevitably added you can't
blame the version control tool for having poor security.</p>

<a href='/blog/category/mozreview'>MozReview</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>MozReview - Mozilla's Review Board based code review tool - now
supports ingestion from Git. Previously, it only supported Mercurial.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install-git.html">Instructions</a>
for configuring Git with MozReview are available. Because blog posts
are not an appropriate medium for documenting systems and processes, I
will not say anything more here on how to use Git with MozReview.</p>
<p>Somewhat related to the introduction of Git support is an improved
mechanism for mapping commits to existing review requests.</p>
<p>When you submit commits to MozReview, MozReview has to decide how
to <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/commits.html#understanding-how-commits-are-mapped-to-review-requests">map</a>
those commits to review requests in Review Board. It has to choose
whether to recycle an existing review request or create a new one.
When recycling, is has to pick an appropriate one. If it chooses
incorrectly, wonky things can happen. For example, a review request
could switch to tracking a new and completely unrelated commit. That's
bad.</p>
<p>Up until today, our commit mapping algorithm was extremely simple. Yet
it seemed to work 90% of the time. However, a number of people
found the cracks and complained. With Git support coming online,
I had a feeling that Git users would find these cracks with higher
frequency than Mercurial users due to what I perceive to be
variations in the commit workflows of Git versus Mercurial. So,
I decided to proactively improve the commit mapping before the Git
users had time to complain.</p>
<p><strong>Both the Git and Mercurial MozReview client-side extensions now insert
a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> metadata line in commit messages.</strong> This line
effectively defines a (likely) unique ID that identifies the commit
across rewrites. When MozReview maps commits to review requests,
it uses this identifier to find matches. What this means is that
history rewriting (such as reordering commits) should be handled
well by MozReview and should not confuse the commit mapping
mechanism.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming the commit mapping mechanism is perfect. In fact,
I know of areas where it can still fall apart. But it is much
better than it was before. If you think you found a bug in the
commit mapping, don't hesitate to
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=MozReview">file a bug</a>.
Please have it block <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1243483">bug 1243483</a>.</p>
<p>A side-effect of introducing this improved commit mapping is that
commit messages will have a <em>MozReview-Commit-ID</em> line in them. This
may startle some. Some may complain about the <em>spam</em>. Unfortunately,
there's no better alternative. Both Mercurial and Git do support a
hidden key-value dictionary for each commit object. In fact, the
MozReview Mercurial extension has been storing the very commit IDs
that now appear in the commit message in this dictionary for months!
Unfortunately, actually using this hidden dictionary for metadata
storage is riddled with problems. For example, some Mercurial
commands don't preserve all the metadata. And accessing or setting
this data from Git is painful. While I wish this metadata (which
provides little value to humans) were not located in the commit
message where humans could be bothered by it, it's really the only
practical place to put it. If people find it super annoying, we
could modify Autoland to strip it before landing. Although, I think
I like having it preserved because it will enable some useful
scenarios down the road, such as better workflows for uplift
requests. It's also worth noting that there is precedent for storing
unique IDs in commit messages for purposes of commit mapping in the
code review tool: <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11.5/user-changeid.html">Gerrit uses Change-ID lines</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the Git support and the more robust commit to review
request mapping mechanism!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I first started writing web services, I was a huge RESTful fan
boy. The architectural properties - especially the parts related to
caching and scalability - really jived with me. But as I've grown
older and gained experienced, I've realized that RESTful design,
like many aspects of software engineering, is more of a guideline
or ideal than a panacea. This post is about one of those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/webapi/">Review Board's Web API</a>
is RESTful. It's actually one of the better examples of a RESTful API
I've seen. There is a very clear separation between <em>resources</em>. And
everything - and I mean everything - is a resource. <em>Hyperlinks</em> are
used for the purposes described in Roy T. Fielding's dissertation.
I can tell the people who authored this web API understood RESTful
design and they succeeded in transferring that knowledge to a web API.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview code review tool</a>
is built on top of Review Board. We've made a number of customizations.
The most significant is the ability to submit a series of commits
as one logical review series. This occurs as a side-effect of a
<em>hg push</em> to the code review repository. Once your changesets
are pushed to the remote repository, that server issues a number of
Review Board Web API HTTP requests to reviewboard.mozilla.org to
create the review requests, assign reviewers, etc. This is mostly all
built on the built-in web API endpoints offered by Review Board.</p>
<p>Because Review Board's Web API adheres to RESTful design principles
so well, turning a series of commits into a series of review requests
takes a lot of HTTP requests. For each commit, we have to perform
something like 5 HTTP requests to define the server state. For
series of say 10 commits (which aren't uncommon since we try to
encourage the use of microcommits), this can add up to dozens of
HTTP requests! And that's just counting the HTTP requests to
Review Board: because we've integrated Review Board with Bugzilla,
events like publishing result in additional RESTful HTTP requests from
Review Board to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, submitting and publishing a series of 10
commits consumes somewhere between 75 and 100 HTTP requests! While
the servers are all in close physical proximity (read: low network
latencies), we are reusing TCP connections, and each HTTP request
completes fairly quickly, the overhead adds up. <strong>It's not uncommon
for publishing commit series to take over 30s.</strong> This is unacceptable
to developers. We want them to publish commits for review as quickly
as possible so they can get on with their next task. Humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>Over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229468">bug 1220468</a>,
I implemented a new batch submit web API for Review Board and converted
the Mercurial server to call it instead of the classic, RESTful Review
Board web APIs. <strong>In other words, I threw away the RESTful properties
of the web API and implemented a monolith API doing exactly what we
need.</strong> The result is a drastic reduction in net HTTP requests. In our
tests, submitting a series of 20 commits for review reduced the HTTP
request count by 104! Furthermore, the new API endpoint performs
all modifications in a single database transaction. Before, each HTTP
request was independent and we had bugs where failures in the middle of
a HTTP request series left the server in inconsistent and unexpected
state. The new API is significantly faster and more atomic as a bonus.
The main reason the new implementation isn't yet nearly instantaneous
is because we're still performing several RESTful HTTP requests to
Bugzilla from Review Board. But there are plans for Bugzilla to
implement the batch APIs we need as well, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>(I don't want to blame the Review Board or Bugzilla maintainers for
their RESTful web APIs that are giving MozReview a bit of scaling pain.
MozReview is definitely abusing them almost certainly in ways that
weren't imagined when they were conceived. To their credit, the
maintainers of both products have recognized the limitations in their
APIs and are working to address them.)</p>
<p>As much as I still love the properties of RESTful design, there are
practical limitations and consequences such as what I described
above. The older and more experienced I get, the less patience I have
for tolerating architecturally pure implementations that sacrifice
important properties, such as ease of use and performance.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the properties of RESTful design are
applicable to <em>microservices</em> as well. When you create a new service
in a microservices architecture, you are creating more overhead for
clients that need to speak to multiple services, making changes less
transactional and atomic, and making it difficult to consolidate
multiple related requests into a higher-level, simpler, and performant
API. I recommend
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">Microservice Trade-Offs</a>
for more on this subject.</p>
<p>There is a place in the world for RESTful and microservice
architectures. And as someone who does a lot of server-side engineering,
I sympathize with wanting scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. But
like most complex problems, you need to be cognizant of trade-offs. It is
also important to not get too caught up with architectural purity if
it is getting in the way of delivering a simple, intuitive, and fast
product for your users. So, please, follow me down from the ivory tower.
The air was cleaner up there - but that was only because it was so
distant from the swamp at the base of the tower that surrounds every
software project.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Most of Mozilla gathered in Orlando in December for an all hands meeting.
If you attended any of the plenary sessions, you probably heard people
like David Bryant and Lawrence Mandel make references to improving the
Firefox build system and related tools. Well, the cat is out of the bag:
<strong>Mozilla will be investing heavily in the Firefox build system and related
tooling in 2016!</strong></p>
<p>In the past 4+ years, the Firefox build system has mostly been held
together and incrementally improved by a loose coalition of people who
cared. We had a period in 2013 where a number of people were making
significant updates (this is when moz.build files happened). But for the
past 1.5+ years, there hasn't really been a coordinated effort to
improve the build system - just a lot of one-off tasks and
(much-appreciated) individual heroics. This is changing.</p>
<p>Improving the build system is a high priority for Mozilla in 2016.
And investment has already begun. In Orlando, we had a marathon 3 hour
meeting planning work for Q1. At least 8 people have committed to
projects in Q1.</p>
<p>The focus of work is split between immediate short-term wins and
longer-term investments. <strong>We also decided to prioritize the Firefox and
Fennec developer workflows (over Gecko/Platform) as well as the
development experience on Windows.</strong> This is because these areas have
been under-loved and therefore have more potential for impact.</p>
<p>Here are the projects we're focusing on in Q1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey artifact based builds for Firefox and Fennec (download
  pre-built binaries so you don't have to spend 20 minutes compiling
  C++)</li>
<li>Running tests from the source directory (so you don't have to copy
  tens of thousands of files to the object directory)</li>
<li>Speed up configure / prototype a replacement</li>
<li>Telemetry for mach and the build system</li>
<li>NSPR, NSS, and (maybe) ICU build system rewrites</li>
<li><em>mach build faster</em> improvements</li>
<li>Improvements to build rules used for building binaries (enables
  non-make build backends)</li>
<li>mach command for analyzing C++ dependencies</li>
<li>Deploy automated testing for <em>mach bootstrap</em> on TaskCluster</li>
</ul>
<p>Work has already started on a number of these projects. I'm optimistic
2016 will be a watershed year for the Firefox build system and the
improvements will have a drastic positive impact on developer
productivity.</p>
