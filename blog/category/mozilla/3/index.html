  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I first started writing web services, I was a huge RESTful fan
boy. The architectural properties - especially the parts related to
caching and scalability - really jived with me. But as I've grown
older and gained experienced, I've realized that RESTful design,
like many aspects of software engineering, is more of a guideline
or ideal than a panacea. This post is about one of those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/webapi/">Review Board's Web API</a>
is RESTful. It's actually one of the better examples of a RESTful API
I've seen. There is a very clear separation between <em>resources</em>. And
everything - and I mean everything - is a resource. <em>Hyperlinks</em> are
used for the purposes described in Roy T. Fielding's dissertation.
I can tell the people who authored this web API understood RESTful
design and they succeeded in transferring that knowledge to a web API.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview code review tool</a>
is built on top of Review Board. We've made a number of customizations.
The most significant is the ability to submit a series of commits
as one logical review series. This occurs as a side-effect of a
<em>hg push</em> to the code review repository. Once your changesets
are pushed to the remote repository, that server issues a number of
Review Board Web API HTTP requests to reviewboard.mozilla.org to
create the review requests, assign reviewers, etc. This is mostly all
built on the built-in web API endpoints offered by Review Board.</p>
<p>Because Review Board's Web API adheres to RESTful design principles
so well, turning a series of commits into a series of review requests
takes a lot of HTTP requests. For each commit, we have to perform
something like 5 HTTP requests to define the server state. For
series of say 10 commits (which aren't uncommon since we try to
encourage the use of microcommits), this can add up to dozens of
HTTP requests! And that's just counting the HTTP requests to
Review Board: because we've integrated Review Board with Bugzilla,
events like publishing result in additional RESTful HTTP requests from
Review Board to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, submitting and publishing a series of 10
commits consumes somewhere between 75 and 100 HTTP requests! While
the servers are all in close physical proximity (read: low network
latencies), we are reusing TCP connections, and each HTTP request
completes fairly quickly, the overhead adds up. <strong>It's not uncommon
for publishing commit series to take over 30s.</strong> This is unacceptable
to developers. We want them to publish commits for review as quickly
as possible so they can get on with their next task. Humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>Over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229468">bug 1220468</a>,
I implemented a new batch submit web API for Review Board and converted
the Mercurial server to call it instead of the classic, RESTful Review
Board web APIs. <strong>In other words, I threw away the RESTful properties
of the web API and implemented a monolith API doing exactly what we
need.</strong> The result is a drastic reduction in net HTTP requests. In our
tests, submitting a series of 20 commits for review reduced the HTTP
request count by 104! Furthermore, the new API endpoint performs
all modifications in a single database transaction. Before, each HTTP
request was independent and we had bugs where failures in the middle of
a HTTP request series left the server in inconsistent and unexpected
state. The new API is significantly faster and more atomic as a bonus.
The main reason the new implementation isn't yet nearly instantaneous
is because we're still performing several RESTful HTTP requests to
Bugzilla from Review Board. But there are plans for Bugzilla to
implement the batch APIs we need as well, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>(I don't want to blame the Review Board or Bugzilla maintainers for
their RESTful web APIs that are giving MozReview a bit of scaling pain.
MozReview is definitely abusing them almost certainly in ways that
weren't imagined when they were conceived. To their credit, the
maintainers of both products have recognized the limitations in their
APIs and are working to address them.)</p>
<p>As much as I still love the properties of RESTful design, there are
practical limitations and consequences such as what I described
above. The older and more experienced I get, the less patience I have
for tolerating architecturally pure implementations that sacrifice
important properties, such as ease of use and performance.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the properties of RESTful design are
applicable to <em>microservices</em> as well. When you create a new service
in a microservices architecture, you are creating more overhead for
clients that need to speak to multiple services, making changes less
transactional and atomic, and making it difficult to consolidate
multiple related requests into a higher-level, simpler, and performant
API. I recommend
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">Microservice Trade-Offs</a>
for more on this subject.</p>
<p>There is a place in the world for RESTful and microservice
architectures. And as someone who does a lot of server-side engineering,
I sympathize with wanting scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. But
like most complex problems, you need to be cognizant of trade-offs. It is
also important to not get too caught up with architectural purity if
it is getting in the way of delivering a simple, intuitive, and fast
product for your users. So, please, follow me down from the ivory tower.
The air was cleaner up there - but that was only because it was so
distant from the swamp at the base of the tower that surrounds every
software project.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Most of Mozilla gathered in Orlando in December for an all hands meeting.
If you attended any of the plenary sessions, you probably heard people
like David Bryant and Lawrence Mandel make references to improving the
Firefox build system and related tools. Well, the cat is out of the bag:
<strong>Mozilla will be investing heavily in the Firefox build system and related
tooling in 2016!</strong></p>
<p>In the past 4+ years, the Firefox build system has mostly been held
together and incrementally improved by a loose coalition of people who
cared. We had a period in 2013 where a number of people were making
significant updates (this is when moz.build files happened). But for the
past 1.5+ years, there hasn't really been a coordinated effort to
improve the build system - just a lot of one-off tasks and
(much-appreciated) individual heroics. This is changing.</p>
<p>Improving the build system is a high priority for Mozilla in 2016.
And investment has already begun. In Orlando, we had a marathon 3 hour
meeting planning work for Q1. At least 8 people have committed to
projects in Q1.</p>
<p>The focus of work is split between immediate short-term wins and
longer-term investments. <strong>We also decided to prioritize the Firefox and
Fennec developer workflows (over Gecko/Platform) as well as the
development experience on Windows.</strong> This is because these areas have
been under-loved and therefore have more potential for impact.</p>
<p>Here are the projects we're focusing on in Q1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey artifact based builds for Firefox and Fennec (download
  pre-built binaries so you don't have to spend 20 minutes compiling
  C++)</li>
<li>Running tests from the source directory (so you don't have to copy
  tens of thousands of files to the object directory)</li>
<li>Speed up configure / prototype a replacement</li>
<li>Telemetry for mach and the build system</li>
<li>NSPR, NSS, and (maybe) ICU build system rewrites</li>
<li><em>mach build faster</em> improvements</li>
<li>Improvements to build rules used for building binaries (enables
  non-make build backends)</li>
<li>mach command for analyzing C++ dependencies</li>
<li>Deploy automated testing for <em>mach bootstrap</em> on TaskCluster</li>
</ul>
<p>Work has already started on a number of these projects. I'm optimistic
2016 will be a watershed year for the Firefox build system and the
improvements will have a drastic positive impact on developer
productivity.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few minutes ago, I formally enabled a new replication system
for <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>. For the curious,
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/replication.html">technical details</a>
are available.</p>
<p>This impacts you because pushes to hg.mozilla.org should now be
significantly faster. For example, pushes to mozilla-inbound
that used to take 15s now take 2s. Pushes to Try that used to
take 45s now take 10s. (Yes, the old replication system really
added a lot of overhead.) Pushes to hg.mozilla.org are still not
as fast as they could be due to us running the service on 5 year
old hardware (we plan to buy new servers this year) and due to the
use of NFS on the server. However, I believe push latency is now
reasonable for every repo except Try.</p>
<p>The new replication system opens the door to a number of future
improvements. We'd like to stand up mirrors in multiple data
centers - perhaps even offices - so clients have the fastest
connectivity and so we have a better disaster recovery story.
The new replication system facilitates this.</p>
<p>The new replication log is effectively a unified pushlog -
something people have wanted for years. While there is not yet
a public API for it, one could potentially be exposed, perhaps
indirectly via Pulse.</p>
<p>It is now trivial for us to stand up new consumers of the
replication log that react to repository events merely milliseconds
after they occur. This should eventually result in downstream
systems like build automation and conversion to Git repos starting
and thus completing faster.</p>
<p>Finally, the new replication system has been running unofficially for
a few weeks, so you likely won't notice anything different today
(other than removal of some printed messages when you push). What
changed today is the new system is enabled by default and we have
no plans to continue supporting or operating the legacy system.
Good riddance.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>There have been a handful of updates to Mozilla's client-side
Mercurial tools in the past week and all users are encouraged
to pull down the latest commit of mozilla-central and run
<em>mach mercurial-setup</em> to ensure their configuration is up to
date.</p>
<p>Improvements to <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>~</em> are now used in paths when appropriate</li>
<li>Mercurial 3.5.2 is now the oldest version you can run without
  the wizard complaining</li>
<li>The clone bundles feature is enabled when running Mercurial 3.6</li>
<li><em>hg wip</em> is available for configuration</li>
<li><em>hgwatchman</em> (make <em>hg status</em> significantly faster via background
  filesystem watching) is now available on OS X</li>
<li>x509 host key fingerprints are no longer pinned if your Python
  and Mercurial version is modern (this pinning exists in Mercurial
  because old versions of Python don't verify x509 certificates
  properly)</li>
<li>3rd party Mercurial extensions are pulled with extensions disabled
  (to prevent issues with old, incompatible extensions crashing the
  <em>hg pull</em> invocation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The firefoxtree extension has also been updated. It now uses the
new <em>namespaces</em> feature of Mercurial so all Firefox labels/names/refs
are exposed in a <em>firefoxtree</em> namespace instead of as tags. As part
of this change, <strong>you will lose old tags created by this extension
and will need to re-pull repos to recreate them as namespaced
labels</strong>. <em>hg log</em> output will now look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>changeset:   332223:0babaa3edcf9
fxtree:      central
parent:      332188:40038a66525f
parent:      332222:c6fc9d77e86f
user:        Carsten "Tomcat" Book &lt;cbook@mozilla.com&gt;
date:        Wed Dec 16 12:01:46 2015 +0100
summary:     merge mozilla-inbound to mozilla-central a=merge
</code></pre>
<p>(Note the <em>fxtree</em> line.)</p>
<p>The firefoxtree extension also now works with <em>hg share</em>. i.e. if
you <em>hg share</em> from a Firefox repository and <em>hg pull</em> from
the source repo or any shared repo, the labels will be updated in
every repo. This only works on newly-created shares. If you want
to enable this on an existing share, see
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115188#c31">this comment</a>.</p>
