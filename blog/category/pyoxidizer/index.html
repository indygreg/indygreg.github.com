  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I am very excited to announce the 0.8 release of
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyOxidizer</a>, a modern
Python application packaging tool. You can find the full changelog
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/history.html">in the docs</a>.
First time user? See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
documentation.</p>
<p>Foremost, I apologize that this release took so long to publish (0.7 was
released on 2020-04-09). I fervently believe that frequent releases are
a healthy software development practice. And 6 months between PyOxidizer
releases was way too long. Part of the delay was due to world events
(it has proven difficult to focus on... anything given a global pandemic,
social unrest, and wildfires further undermining any resemblance of
lifestyle normalcy in California). Another contributing factor was I was
waiting on a few 3rd party Rust crates to have new versions published to
crates.io (you can't release a crate to crates.io unless all your
dependencies are also published there).</p>
<p>Release delay and general life hardships aside, the 0.8 release is here
and it is full of notable improvements!</p>
<h2>Python 3.8 and 3.9 Support</h2>
<p><strong>PyOxidizer 0.8 now targets Python 3.8 by default and support for Python
3.9 is available</strong> by tweaking configuration files. Previously, we only
supported Python 3.7 and this release drops support for Python 3.7. I feel
a bit bad for dropping compatibility. But Python 3.8 introduced a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init_config.html">new C API</a> for initializing
Python interpreters (thank you Victor Stinner!) and this makes PyOxidizer's
run-time code for interfacing with Python interpreters vastly simpler.
I decided that given the beta nature of PyOxidizer, it wasn't worth
maintaining complexity to continue to support Python 3.7. I'm optimistic
that I'll be able to support Python 3.8 as a baseline for a while.</p>
<h1>Better Default Packaging Settings</h1>
<p>PyOxidizer started as a science experiment of sorts to see if I could
achieve the elusive goal of producing a single file executable providing
a Python application. I was successful in proving this hypothesis. But the
cost to achieving this outcome was rather high in terms of end-user
experience: in order to produce single file executables, you had to break
a lot of assumptions about how Python typically works and this in turn broke
a lot of Python code and packages in the wild.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>PyOxidizer's opinionated defaults of producing a single file
executable were externalizing hardship on end-users and preventing them from
using PyOxidizer.</strong></p>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 contains a handful of changes to defaults that should hopefully
lessen the friction.</p>
<p>On Windows, the default Python distribution now has a more traditional
build configuration (using <code>.pyd</code> extension modules and a <code>pythonXY.dll</code>
file). <strong>This means that PyOxidizer can consume pre-built extension modules
without having to recompile them from source.</strong> If you publish a Windows
binary wheel on PyPI, in many cases it will <em>just work</em> with PyOxidizer
0.8! (There are some notable exceptions to this, such as <em>numpy</em>, which is
doing wonky things with the location of shared libraries in wheels - but
I aim to fix this soon.)</p>
<p>Also on Windows, we no longer attempt to embed Python extension modules
(<code>.pyd</code> files) and their shared library dependencies in the produced
binary and load them from memory by default. This is because PyOxidizer's
from-memory library loader didn't work in all cases. For example, some
OpenSSL functionality used by the <code>_ssl</code> module in the standard library
didn't work, preventing Python from establishing TLS connections. The old
mode enabling you to produce a single file executable on Windows is still
available. But you have to opt in to it (at the likely cost of more
packaging and compatibility pain).</p>
<h2>Starlark Configuration Overhaul</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 contains a <strong>ton</strong> of changes to its Starlark configuration
files. There are so many changes that you may find it easier to port to
PyOxidizer 0.8 by creating a new configuration file rather than attempting
to port an existing one.</p>
<p>I apologize for this churn and recognize it will be disruptive. However,
this churn needed to happen for various reasons.</p>
<p>Much of the old Starlark configuration semantics was rooted in the days
when configuration files were static TOML files. Now that configuration
files provide the power of a (Python-inspired) programming language, we
are free to expose much more flexibility. But that flexibility requires
refactoring things so the experience feels more <em>native</em>.</p>
<p>Many changes to Starlark were rooted in necessity. For example,
the methods for invoking <code>setup.py</code> or <code>pip install</code> used to live on a
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config_type_python_distribution.html">Python distribution type</a>
and have been moved to a
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config_type_python_executable.html">type representing executables</a>.
This is because the binary we are targeting influences how
packaging actions behave. For example, if the binary only supports
loading resources from memory (as opposed to standalone files), we need
to know that when invoking the packaging tool so we can produce files
(notably Python extension modules) compatible with the destination.</p>
<p>A major change to Starlark in 0.8 is around resource location handling.
Before, you could define a static string denoting the <em>resources policy</em>
for where things should be placed. And there were 10+ methods for
adding different resource types (source, bytecode, extensions, package
data) to different load locations (memory, filesystem). This mechanism
is vastly simplified and more powerful in PyOxidizer 0.8!</p>
<p>In PyOxidizer 0.8, there is a single
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config_type_python_executable.html#pythonexecutable-add-python-resource">add_python_resource()</a>
method for adding a resource to a binary and the Starlark objects you add
can denote where they should be added by
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config_resource_add_attributes.html">defining attributes on those objects</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/packaging_resources.html#using-callbacks-to-influence-resource-attributes">define a Starlark function</a>
that is called when resource objects are created to apply custom packaging
<em>rules</em> using custom Starlark code defined in your PyOxidizer config file.
So rather than having everyone try to abide by a few pre-canned <em>policies</em> for
packaging resources, you can define a proper function in your config file
that can be as complex as you want/need it to be! I feel this is vastly simpler
and more powerful than implementing a custom DSL in static configuration files
(like TOML, JSON, YAML, etc).</p>
<p>While the ability to implement your own arbitrarily complex packaging
policies is useful, there is a new
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config_type_python_packaging_policy.html">PythonPackagingPolicy</a>
Starlark type with enough flexibility to suit most needs.</p>
<h2>Shipping <code>oxidized_importer</code></h2>
<p>During the development of PyOxidizer 0.8, I broke out the custom
Rust-based Python <em>meta-path importer</em> used by PyOxidizer's run-time code
into a standalone Python package. This sub-project is called
<code>oxidized_importer</code> and I previously
<a href="/blog/2020/05/10/using-rust-to-power-python-importing-with-oxidized_importer/">blogged about it</a>.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 ships <code>oxidized_importer</code> and all of its useful APIs
available to Python. Read more in the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/v0.8.0/latest/oxidized_importer.html">official docs</a>.
The new Python APIs should make debugging issues with PyOxidizer-packaged
applications vastly simpler: I found them invaluable when tracking down
user-reported bugs!</p>
<h2>Tons of New Tests and Refactored Code</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer was my first non-toy Rust project. And the quality of the Rust
code I produced in early versions of PyOxidizer clearly showed it. And when I
was in the rapid-prototyping phase of PyOxidizer, I eschewed writing tests
in favor of short-term progress.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer 0.8 pays down a ton of technical debt in the code base. Lots of
Rust code has been refactored and is using somewhat reasonable practices.
I'm not yet a Rust guru. But I'm at the point where I cringe when I look at
some of the early code I wrote, which is a good sign. I do have to say that
Rust has been a dream to work with during this transition. Despite being a
low-level language, my early <em>misuse</em> of Rust did not result in crashes like
you would see in languages like C/C++. And Rust's seemingly omniscient compiler
and IDE tools facilitating refactoring have ensured that code changes aren't
accompanied by subtle random bugs that would occur in dynamic programming
languages. I really need to write a dedicated post espousing the virtues of
Rust...</p>
<p>There are a <strong>ton</strong> of new tests in PyOxidizer 0.8 and I now feel somewhat
confident that the <code>main</code> branch of PyOxidizer should be considered
<em>production-ready</em> at any time assuming the tests pass. This will hopefully
lead to more rapid releases in the future.</p>
<p>There are now tests for the <code>pyembed</code> Rust crate, which provides the
run-time code for PyOxidizer-built binaries. We even have
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/tree/main/pyembed/src/test">Python-based unit tests</a>
for validating the Python-exposed APIs behave as expected. These tests have
been invaluable for ensuring that the run-time code works as expected. So now
when someone files a bug I can easily write a test to capture it and keep
the code working as intended through various refactors.</p>
<p>The packaging-time Rust code has also gained its fair share of tests.
We now have fairly comprehensive test coverage around how resources
are added/packaged. Python extension modules have proved to be highly
nuanced in how they are handled. Tremendously helping testing of extension
modules is that we're able to run tests for platform non-native extensions!
While not yet exposed/supported by Starlark configuration files, <strong>I've taught
PyOxidizer's core Rust code to be cross-compiling aware</strong> so that we can
e.g. test Windows or macOS behavior from Linux. Before, I'd have to test
Windows wheel handling on Windows. But after writing a wheel parser in Rust
and teaching PyOxidizer to use a different Python distribution for the
host architecture from the target architecture, I'm now able to write
tests for platform-specific functionality that run on any platform that
PyOxidizer can run on. This <em>may</em> eventually lead to proper cross-compiling
support (at least in some configuration). Time will tell. But the foundation
is definitely there!</p>
<h2>New Rust Crates</h2>
<p>As part of the aforementioned refactoring of PyOxidizer's Rust code, I've
been extracting some useful/generic functionality built as part of
developing PyOxidizer to their own Rust crates.</p>
<p>As part of this release, I'm publishing the initial 0.1 release of the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packaging">python-packaging</a> crate
(<a href="https://docs.rs/python-packaging/0.1.0/python_packaging/">docs</a>). This crate
provides pure Rust code for various Python <em>packaging</em> related functionality.
This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust types representing Python resource types (source modules, bytecode
  modules, extension modules, package resources, etc).</li>
<li>Scanning the filesystem for Python resource files .</li>
<li>Configuring an embedded Python interpreter.</li>
<li>Parsing <code>PKG-INFO</code> and related files.</li>
<li>Parsing wheel files.</li>
<li>Collecting Python resources and serializing them to a data structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crate is somewhat PyOxidizer centric. But if others are interested
in improving its utility, I'll happily accept pull requests!</p>
<p>PyOxidizer's crates footprint now includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packed-resources">python-packed-resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packaging">python-packaging</a></li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pyembed">pyembed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pyoxidizer">pyoxidizer</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Documentation Updates</h2>
<p>I strongly believe that software should be documented thoroughly and I strive
for PyOxidizer's documentation to be useful and comprehensive.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of changes to PyOxidizer's documentation since the
0.7 release.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/config.html">configuration file documentation</a>
has been consolidated.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've attempted to consolidate a lot of the <em>paved road</em> documentation
for how to use PyOxidizer in the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/packaging.html">Packaging User Guide</a>
section of the docs.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, since I have so much of PyOxidizer's workings internalized,
it can be difficult for me to empathize with PyOxidizer's users. So if you
have difficult with the <em>readability</em> of the documentation, please
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/new">file an issue</a> and report
what is confusing so the documentation can be improved!</p>
<h2>Mercurial Shipping With PyOxidizer 0.8</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer is arguably an epic yak shave of mine to help the
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial version control tool</a> transition
to Python 3 and Rust.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to report that Mercurial is
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/pipermail/mercurial/2020-October/052395.html">now shipping</a>
PyOxidizer-built distributions on Windows as of the 5.2.2 release a few days
ago! If a complex Python application like Mercurial can be
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/0627cd03b1e9/rust/hgcli/pyoxidizer.bzl">configured</a>
to work with PyOxidizer, chances are your Python application will work as
well.</p>
<h2>Whats Next</h2>
<p>I view PyOxidizer 0.8 as a pivotal release where PyOxidizer is turning the
corner from a prototyping science experiment to something more generally
usable. The investments in test coverage and refactoring of the Rust
internals are paving the way towards future features and bug fixes.</p>
<p>In upcoming releases, I'd like to close remaining known compatibility
gaps with popular Python packages (such as <em>numpy</em> and other packages in
the <em>scientific/data</em> space). I have a general idea of what work needs to
be done and I've been laying the ground work via various refactorings to
execute here.</p>
<p><strong>I want a general theme of future releases to be eliminating reasons why
people can't use PyOxidizer.</strong> PyOxidizer's historical origin was as a
science experiment to see if single file Python applications were possible.
It is clear that achieving this is fundamentally incompatible with
compatibility with tons of Python packages in the wild. I'd like to find a
way where PyOxidizer can achieve 99% package compatibility by default
so new users don't get discouraged when using PyOxidizer. And for the
subset of users who want single file executables, they can spend the
magnitude of additional effort to achieve that.</p>
<p>At some point, I also want to make a pivot towards focusing on producing
distributable artifacts (Debian/RPM packages, MSI installers, macOS DMG
files, etc). I'm slightly bummed that I haven't made much progress here.
But I have a vision in my mind of where I want to go (I'll be making
a standalone Rust crate + Starlark dialect to facilitate producing
distributable artifacts for <em>any</em> application) and I'm anticipating
starting this work in the next few months. In the mean time, PyOxidizer
0.8 should be able to give people a directory tree that they can coerce
into distributable artifacts using existing packaging tooling. That's not as
turnkey as I would like it to be. But the technical problems around
building a distributable Python application binary still needs some work
and I view that as the most pressing need for the Python ecosystem. So
I'll continue to focus there so there is a solid foundation to build upon.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I hope you enjoy the new release! Please report any issues
or feedback in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/new">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of the <code>oxidized_importer</code>
Python package, a standalone version of the custom Python module importer
used by <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a>.
<code>oxidized_importer</code> - a Python extension module implemented in Rust - enables
Python applications to start and run quicker by providing an alternate,
more efficient mechanism for loading Python resources (such as source
and bytecode modules).</p>
<p>Installation instructions and detailed usage information are available
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/oxidized_importer-0.1/oxidized_importer.html">in the official documentation</a>.
The rest of this post hopefully answers the questions of <em>why are you doing
this</em> and <em>why should I care</em>.</p>
<p>In a traditional Python process, Python's module importer inspects the
filesystem at run-time to find and load resources like Python source and
bytecode modules. It is highly dynamic in nature and relies on the filesystem
as a point-in-time source of truth for resource availability.</p>
<p><code>oxidized_importer</code> takes a different approach to resource loading that is
more static in nature and more suitable to application environments (where
Python resources aren't changing). Instead of dynamically probing the
filesystem for available resources, resources are instead <em>indexed</em> ahead
of time. When Python goes to resolve a resource (say it is looking to
<code>import</code> a module), <code>oxidized_importer</code> simply needs to perform a lookup
in an in-memory data structure to locate said resource. This means
<code>oxidized_importer</code> only has marginal reliance on the filesystem, <strong>which
can make it much faster than Python's traditional importer</strong>. (Performance
benefits of binaries built with PyOxidizer have already been
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/oxidized_importer-0.1/packaging_performance.html">clearly demonstrated</a>.)</p>
<p>The <code>oxidized_importer</code> Python extension module exposes parts of
PyOxidizer's packaging and run-time functionality to Python code, <strong>without
requiring the full use of PyOxidizer for application packaging</strong>.
Specifically, <code>oxidized_importer</code> allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a custom, high-performance module importer
  (<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/oxidized_importer-0.1/oxidized_importer_oxidized_finder.html">OxidizedFinder</a>)
  to service Python <code>import</code> statements and resource loading (potentially
  from memory, using zero-copy).</li>
<li><a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/oxidized_importer-0.1/oxidized_importer_resource_scanning.html">Scan the filesystem for Python resources</a>
  (source modules, bytecode files, package resources, distribution metadata,
  etc) and turn them into Python objects, which can be loaded into
  <code>OxidizedFinder</code> instances.</li>
<li>Serialize Python resource data into an efficient binary data structure
  for loading into an <code>OxidizedFinder</code> instance. This facilitates
  producing a standalone <em>resources blob</em> that can be distributed with
  a Python application which contains all the Python modules, bytecode,
  etc required to power that application. See the docs on
  <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/oxidized_importer-0.1/oxidized_importer_freezing_applications.html">freezing an application with oxidized_importer</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>oxidized_importer</code> can be thought of as PyOxidizer-lite: it provides just
enough functionality to allow Python application maintainers to leverage some
of the technical advancements of PyOxidizer (such as in-memory module imports)
without using PyOxidizer for application packaging. <strong><code>oxidized_importer</code> can
work with the Python distribution already installed on your system. You just
<code>pip install</code> it like any other Python package.</strong></p>
<p>By releasing <code>oxidized_importer</code> as a standalone Python package, my hope is
to allow more people to leverage some of the technical achievements and
performance benefits coming out of PyOxidizer. I also hope that having more
users of PyOxidizer's underlying code will help uncover bugs and conformance
issues, raising the quality and viability of the projects.</p>
<p>I would also like to use <code>oxidized_importer</code> as an opportunity to advance the
discourse around Python's resource loading mechanism. Filesystem I/O can be
extremely slow, especially in mobile and embedded environments. Dynamically
probing the filesystem to service module imports can therefore be slow. (The
Python standard library has the <code>zipimport</code> module for importing Python resources
from a zip file. But in my opinion, we can do much better.) <strong>I would like to
see Python move towards leveraging immutable, serialized data structures for
loading resources as efficiently as possible.</strong> After all, Python resources
like the Python standard library are likely not changing between Python process
invocations. The performance zealot in me cringes thinking of all the overhead
that Python's filesystem probing approach incurs - all of the excessive <code>stat()</code>
and other filesystem I/O calls that must be performed to answer questions about
state that is easily indexed and often doesn't change. <code>oxidized_importer</code>
represents my vision for what a high-performance Python resource loader should
look like. I hope it can be successful in steering Python towards a better
approach for resource loading.</p>
<p>I plan to release <code>oxidized_importer</code> independently from <code>PyOxidizer</code>. While
the projects will continue to be developed in the same
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">repository</a> and will leverage the
same underlying Rust code, I view them as somewhat independent and serving
different audiences.</p>
<p>While <code>oxidized_importer</code> evolved from facilitating PyOxidizer's run-time use
cases, I'm not opposed to taking it in new directions. For example, I would
entertain implementing Python's dynamic filesystem probing logic in
<code>oxidized_importer</code>, allowing it to serve as a functional stand-in for the
official importer shipped with the Python standard library. I have little
doubt an importer implemented in 100% Rust would outperform the official
importer, which is implemented in Python. There's all kinds of possibilities
here, such as using a background thread to index <code>sys.path</code> outside the
constraints of the GIL. But I don't want to get ahead of myself...</p>
<p>If you are a Python application maintainer and want to make your Python
processes execute a bit faster by leveraging a pre-built index of available
Python resources and/or taking advantage of in-memory module importing,
I highly encourage you to take a look at <code>oxidized_importer</code>!</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I am very pleased to announce the 0.7 release of
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyOxidizer</a>, a modern
Python application packaging tool.</p>
<p>There are a host of notable new features in this release. You can
read all about them in the project
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>I want to use this blog post to call out the more meaningful ones.</p>
<p>I started PyOxidizer as a science experiment of sorts: I sat out to
prove the hypothesis that it was possible to produce high performance
single file executables embedding Python and all of its resources
(Python modules, non-module resource files, compiled extensions, etc).
PyOxidizer has achieved this on Windows, Linux, and macOS since its
very earliest releases. Hypothesis confirmed!</p>
<p>In order to actually achieve single file executables, you have to
fundamentally change aspects of Python's behavior. Some of these
changes invalidate deeply rooted assumptions about how Python works,
such as the existence of <code>__file__</code> in modules. As you can imagine,
these broken assumptions translated to numerous compatibility issues
and PyOxidizer didn't work with many popular Python packages.</p>
<p>With the science experiment phase of PyOxidizer out of the way, I
have been making a concerted effort to broaden the user base of
PyOxidizer. While single file executables can be an amazing property,
it isn't critical for many use cases and the issues it was causing
were preventing people from exploring PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>This brings us to what I think are the major new features in
PyOxidizer 0.7.</p>
<h2>Better Support for Loading Extension Modules</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer insisted that you compile Python
(C) extension modules from source and statically link them into
a produced binary. This requirement prevented the use of pre-built
extension modules (commonly found in Python binary wheels available
on PyPI) with PyOxidizer, forcing people to compile them locally.
While this often <em>just worked</em> for many extension modules, it
frequently failed on complex extension modules and it frequently
failed on Windows.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer now supports loading compiled extension modules from
standalone files (typically <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code> files, which are actually
shared libraries). There are still some sharp edges and known
deficiencies. But in many cases, if you tell PyOxidizer to run
<code>pip install</code> and package the result, pre-built wheels can be
installed and PyOxidizer will pick up the standalone files.</p>
<p>On Windows, PyOxidizer even supports embedding the shared library
data into the produced <code>.exe</code> and loading the <code>.pyd</code>/DLL directly
from memory.</p>
<h2>Loading Resources from the Filesystem</h2>
<p>Binaries built with PyOxidizer contain a blob holding an index
of available Python resources along with their data.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer only allowed you to define resources
as <em>in-memory</em>. If the resource was defined in this blob, it was
imported from memory. Otherwise it wasn't known to PyOxidizer.
You could still install files next to the produced binary and
tell PyOxidizer to enable Python's default filesystem-based
importer. But PyOxidizer didn't explicitly know about these
files on the filesystem.</p>
<p>In PyOxidizer 0.7, the blob index of Python resources is able to
express different <em>locations</em> for that resource. Currently, a
resource can have its data made available <em>in-memory</em> or
<em>filesystem-relative</em>. <em>in-memory</em> works as before: the raw
data is embedded next to the next in memory and loaded from
there (using 0-copy). <em>filesystem-relative</em> encodes a filesystem
path to the resource. During packaging, PyOxidizer will place
the resource next to the executable (using a typical Python
file layout scheme) and store the relative path to that resource
in the resources index.</p>
<p>The <em>filesystem-relative</em> resource indexing feature has a few
implications for PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>First, it is more standard. When PyOxidizer loads a Python
module from the filesystem, it sets <code>__file__</code>, <code>__path__</code>,
etc and the module semantics should behave as if the file
were imported by Python's standard importer. This means that
if a package is having issues with <em>in-memory</em> importing, you
can simply fall back to <em>filesystem-relative</em> to get standard
Python behavior and everything should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>Second, PyOxidizer's filesystem resource loading is faster
than Python's! When Python's standard importer goes to
<code>import</code> a module, it needs to <code>stat()</code> various paths to
first locate the file. It then performs some sanity checking
and other minor actions before actually importing the module.
All of this has overhead. Since the goal of PyOxidizer is
to produce standalone applications and applications should
be immutable, PyOxidizer can avoid most of this overhead.
PyOxidizer simply tries to <code>open()</code> and <code>read()</code> the relative
path baked into the resource index at build time. If that
works, the resource is loaded. Else there is a failure.
The code path in PyOxidizer to locate a Python resource
is effectively a lookup in a Rust <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;str, T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to isolate the performance
benefits of this new feature. I ran Mercurial's test harness
with different variants of <code>hg</code> on Linux on my Ryzen 3950X.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>traditional</em> - A <code>hg</code> script with a <code>#!/path/to/python3.7</code> shebang.</li>
<li><em>oxidized</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer, without
  PyOxidizer's custom module importer.</li>
<li><em>filesystem</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer using the
  new filesystem-relative resource index.</li>
<li><em>in-memory</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer with all
  resources loaded from memory (how PyOxidizer has traditionally worked).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are quite clear:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variant</th><th>CPU Time (s)</th><th>Delta (s)</th><th>% Orig</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>traditional</td><td style="text-align: right">11,287</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>oxidized</td><td style="text-align: right">10,735</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">95.1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>filesystem</td><td style="text-align: right">10,186</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,101</td><td style="text-align: right">90.2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>in-memory</td><td style="text-align: right">9,883</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,404</td><td style="text-align: right">87.6</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We see a nice win just from using a native executable built
with PyOxidizer (<em>traditional</em> to <em>oxidized</em>).</p>
<p>Then from <em>oxidized</em> to <em>filesystem</em> we see another jump of
~5%. This difference is attributed to using PyOxidizer's
Rust-powered importer with an index of resources available
on the filesystem. In other words, all that work that Python's
standard importer is doing to discover files and then operate
on them is non-trivial!</p>
<p>Finally, the smaller jump from <em>filesystem</em> to <em>in-memory</em>
isolates the benefits of importing resource data from
memory instead of involving filesystem I/O. (Filesystems
are generally slow.) While I haven't measured explicitly,
I hypothesize that macOS and Windows will see a bigger
jump between these two variants, as the filesystem
performance on these platforms generally isn't as good
as it is on Linux.</p>
<h2>PyOxidizer's Future</h2>
<p>With PyOxidizer now supporting a couple of much-needed
features to support a broader set of users, I'm hoping that
future releases of PyOxidizer continue to broaden the utility
of PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>The over-arching goal of PyOxidizer is to solve large aspects
of the Python application packaging and distribution problem.
So far a lot of focus has been spent on the former. PyOxidizer
in its current form can materialize files on the filesystem
that you can copy or package up manually and distribute. But
I want these processes to be part of PyOxidizer: I want it to
be possible for PyOxidizer to emit a Windows MSI installer, a
macOS dmg, a Debian package, etc for a Python application.</p>
<p>In order to support the aforementioned marquee features
of this PyOxidizer release, I had to pay down a lot of
technical debt in the code base left over from the science
experiment phase of PyOxidizer's inception.</p>
<p>In the short term, I plan to continue shoring up the code base
and rounding out support for features requested in the
issue tracker on GitHub. The next release of PyOxidizer will
also <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/234">likely require</a>
Python 3.8, as this will improve run-time control over the
embedded Python interpreter and enable PyOxidizer to better
support package metadata (<code>importlib.metadata</code>), enabling
support for features like <em>entry points</em>.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about extracting PyOxidizer's custom
module importer to be usable as a standalone Python extension
module. I think there's some value in publishing a
<code>pyoxidizer_importer</code> package on PyPI that you can easily
add to your installed packages to speed up Python's
standard filesystem importer by a few percent. If nothing else,
this may drum up interest in the larger Python community for
standardizing a format for serializing Python resources in a
single file. Perhaps we can get other Python packaging tools
producing the same
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packed-resources">packed resources data</a>
blob that PyOxidizer uses so we can all standardize on a
more efficient mechanism for loading Python modules. Time
will tell.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new release. File issues at

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The <a href="/blog/2019/06/24/building-standalone-python-applications-with-pyoxidizer/">initial release</a>
of PyOxidizer generated a bit of excitement across the Internet! The post was
commented on heavily in various forums and my phone was constantly buzzing from
all the Twitter activity. There has been a steady stream of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">GitHub Issues</a> for the project,
which I consider a good sign. So thank you everybody for the support and
encouragement! And especially thank you to everyone who filed an issue or
submitted a pull request!</p>
<p>While I don't usually read the comments, I was looking at various forums
posting about PyOxidizer to see what reactions were like. A common negative
theme was the lack of C extension support in PyOxidizer. People seemed
dismissive of PyOxidizer because it didn't support C extensions. Despite the
documentation stating that the feature was planned and that I had an idea for
how to implement it, people seemed pessimistic. Perhaps I didn't adequately
communicate that making C extensions work is actually a subset of the
already-solved <em>single file executable</em> problem and therefore was already
a <em>solved problem</em> at the technical level (only the integration with the
Python and PyOxidizer <em>build systems</em> was missing). So in my mind C
extension support was only a matter of time and the only open question was
how many hacks would be needed to make it work, not <em>whether</em> it would work.</p>
<p>Well, I'm pleased to report that <strong>the just-released version 0.2 of PyOxidizer
supports C extensions on Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>. If you install a Python
package through a <code>pip-install-simple</code>, <code>pip-requirements-file</code>, or
<code>setup-py-install</code> packaging rule, C extensions will be compiled in a special
way that enables them to be embedded in the same binary containing Python
itself. I've tested it with the <code>zope.interface</code>, <code>zstandard</code>, and
<code>mercurial</code> packages and it seems to work (although Mercurial has other
issues that prevent it from being packaged as a PyOxidizer application - but
the C extensions do compile).</p>
<p>There are some
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html#native-extension-modules">limitations</a>
to the support, however. I'm pretty confident the limitations can be eliminated
given enough time. Given how many people were hung up on the lack of C extensions
and were seemingly writing off PyOxidizer thinking it was snake oil or something,
I wanted to deliver basic C extension support to curtail this line of criticism.
Perfect is the enemy of good and hopefully basic C extension support is good
enough to ease concerns about PyOxidizer's viability.</p>
<p>Also in PyOxidizer 0.2 are some minor new features, like the <code>--pip-install</code> and
<code>--python-code</code> flags to <code>pyoxidizer init</code>. These allow you to generate a
<code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file pre-configured to install some packages from pip and run
custom Python code. So now applications can be created and built with a one-liner
without having to edit a <code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file!</p>
<p>The full release notes <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html">are available</a>.
As always, please keep
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>. I'm particularly
interested in hearing about packages whose C extensions don't work properly.</p>

  <p>Python application distribution is generally considered an unsolved
problem. At their PyCon 2019 keynote talk, Russel Keith-Magee
<a href="https://youtu.be/ftP5BQh1-YM?t=2033">identified code distribution</a> as
a potential <em>black swan</em> - an existential threat for longevity - for
Python. In their words, <em>Python hasn't ever had a consistent story for
how I give my code to someone else, especially if that someone else
isn't a developer and just wants to use my application.</em> I completely
agree. And I want to add my opinion that unless your target user is a
Python developer, they shouldn't need to know anything about Python
packaging, Python itself, or even the existence of Python in order to
use your application. (And you can replace <em>Python</em> in the previous
sentence with any programming language or software technology: most
end-users don't care about the technical implementation, they just
want to get stuff done.)</p>
<p>Today, I'm excited to announce the first release of PyOxidizer
(<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">project</a>,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>), an open
source utility that aims to solve the Python application distribution
problem! (The installation instructions are in the docs.)</p>
<h2>Standalone Single File, No Dependencies Executable Python Applications</h2>
<p><strong>PyOxidizer's marquee feature is that it can produce a single file
executable containing a fully-featured Python interpreter, its
extensions, standard library, and your application's modules and
resources.</strong> In other words, you can have a single <code>.exe</code> providing
your application. And unlike other tools in this space which tend to
be operating system specific, PyOxidizer works across platforms
(currently Windows, macOS, and Linux - the most popular platforms for
Python today). Executables built with PyOxidizer have minimal
dependencies on the host environment nor do they do anything
complicated at run-time. I believe PyOxidizer is the only open
source tool to have all these attributes.</p>
<p><strong>On Linux, it is possible to build a fully statically linked executable.</strong>
You can drop this executable into a chroot or container where it is the
only file and it will <em>just work</em>. On macOS and Windows, the only
library dependencies are on always-present or extremely common
libraries. More details are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributing.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>At execution time, binaries built with PyOxidizer do not do anything
special to run the Python interpreter. (Other tools in this space do
things like create a temporary directory or SquashFS filesystem and
extract Python to it.) <strong>PyOxidizer loads everything from memory and there
is no explicit I/O being performed. When you <code>import</code> a Python module,
the bytecode for that module is being loaded from a memory address in
the executable using zero-copy.</strong> This makes PyOxidizer executables
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#faster-python-programs">faster</a>
to start and <code>import</code> - faster than a <code>python</code> executable itself!</p>
<h2>Current Release and Future Roadmap</h2>
<p>Today's release of PyOxidizer is just the first release milestone in
what I envision is a long and successful project history. While my
over-arching goal with PyOxidizer is to <em>solve</em> vast swaths of the
Python application distribution problem, I want to be clear that this
first release comes nowhere close to doing so. I toiled with what
features <em>must</em> be in the initial release. I ultimately decided that
PyOxidizer's current functionality is extremely valuable to <em>some</em>
audiences and that the project has matured to the point where more
eyeballs and users would substantially help its development. (I could
definitely use some help prioritizing which features to work on and
for that I need users and user feedback.)</p>
<p>In today's release, PyOxidizer is good at producing executables
embedding Python. It doesn't yet venture too far into the <em>distribution</em>
part of the problem (I want it to be trivial to produce MSI installers,
DMG images, deb/rpm packages, etc). But on Linux, this is already a huge
step forward because PyOxidizer makes it easy (hopefully!) to produce
binaries that should <em>just work</em> on other machines. (Anyone who has
attempted to distribute Linux applications will tell you how painful this
problem can be.)</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, I believe today's release of PyOxidizer to
be a viable tool for some applications. And I believe PyOxidizer can
start to replace existing tools in this space. (See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparisons.html">Comparisons to Other Tools</a>
document for how PyOxidizer compares to other Python packaging and
distribution tools.)</p>
<p>Using today's release of PyOxidizer, larger user-facing applications
using Python (like Dropbox, <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>,
<a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a>, etc) could use
PyOxidizer to produce self-contained executables. This would likely cut
down on installer size, decrease install/update time (fewer files means
faster operations), and hopefully make packaging simpler for application
maintainers. Maintainers of Python utilities could produce self-contained
executables, making their utilities faster to start and easier to
package and distribute.</p>
<h2>New Possibilities and Reliability for Python</h2>
<p>By enabling support for self-contained, single file Python applications,
PyOxidizer opens exciting new doors for Python. Because Python has
historically required an explicit, separate runtime not part of the
executable, Python was not viable (or was a hinderance) in many domains.
For example, if you wanted to use Python to <em>bootstrap</em> a fresh server
or empty container environment, you had a chicken-and-egg problem because
you needed to install Python before you could use it.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> for example. One of Ansible's
features is that it remotes into a machine and runs things. The way
it does this is it dynamically generates Python scripts locally, uploads
them to the remote machine, and tells the remote to execute them. Those
Python scripts require the existence of a Python interpreter on the
remote machine. This means you need to install Python on a machine before
you can control it with Ansible. Furthermore, because the remote's Python
isn't under Ansible's control, you can assume very little about its behavior
and capabilities, making interaction a bit brittle.</p>
<p>Using PyOxidizer, projects like Ansible could produce a self-contained
executable containing a Python interpreter. They could transfer that
single binary to the remote machine and execute it, instantly giving the
remote machine access to a fully-featured and modern Python interpreter.
From there, the sky is the limit. In Ansible's case, the executable could
contain the full Ansible runtime, along with any 3rd party Python
packages they wanted to leverage. This would allow execution to occur
(possibly mostly independently) on the remote machine. This architecture
is simpler, scales better, would likely result in faster operations, and
would probably improve the quality of life for everyone involved, from
application developers to its end users.</p>
<p><strong>Self-contained Python applications built with PyOxidizer essentially
solve the <em>Python interpreter bootstrapping and reliability</em> problems.</strong>
By providing a Python interpreter and a known set of Python modules, you
provide a highly deterministic and reliable execution environment for your
application. You don't need to fret about which version of Python
is installed: you <em>know</em> which version of Python you are using.
You don't need to worry about which Python packages are installed:
you control explicitly which packages are available. You don't need to
worry about whether you are running in a virtualenv, what <code>sys.path</code>
is set to, whether <code>.pth</code> files come into play, whether various
<code>PYTHON*</code> environment variables can mess up your application, whether
some Linux distribution packaged Python differently, what to put in your
script's <em>shebang</em>, etc: executables built with PyOxidizer behave as
you have instructed them to because they are <em>compiled</em> that way.</p>
<p>All of the concerns in the previous paragraph contribute to a larger
problem in the eyes of application maintainers that can be summarized as
<em>Python isn't reliable</em>. And because <em>Python isn't reliable</em>, many
people reach the conclusion that <em>Python shouldn't be used</em> (this is the
<em>black swan</em> that was referred to earlier). With PyOxidizer, the Python
environment is isolated and highly deterministic making the
reliability problem largely go away. This makes Python a more viable
technology choice. And it enables application maintainers to aggressively
adopt modern Python versions, utilize third party packages fearlessly,
and spend far less time chasing an extremely long tail of issues related
to Python environment variance. Succinctly, application developers can
focus on building great applications instead of toiling with Python
environment problems.</p>
<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer is still in its relative infancy. While it is far from
feature complete, I'm mentally committed to working on the remaining
major functionality. The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html">Status</a>
document lists major missing functionality, lesser missing functionality,
and potential future value-add functionality.</p>
<p>I want PyOxidizer to provide a Python application packaging and
distribution experience that <em>just works</em> with minimal cognitive effort
from Python application maintainers. I have spent a lot of effort
documenting PyOxidizer. I care passionately about user experience and want
everything about PyOxidizer to be simple and frustration free. I
know things aren't there yet. The problems that PyOxidizer is attempting
to solve are hard (that's a reason nobody has solved them well yet). I
know there's details floating around in my head that haven't been
added to the documentation yet. I know there's missing features and
bugs in PyOxidizer. I know there are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_pitfalls.html">Packaging Pitfalls</a>
yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to make PyOxidizer great.</strong> I encourage Python
application maintainers reading this to head over to
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
and the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging.html">Packaging User Guide</a>
and try to package your applications with PyOxidizer. If things don't
work, let me know by <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing an issue</a>.
If you are confused by lack of or unclear documentation, file an issue.
If something frustrates you, file an issue. If you want to suggest I

<a href="https://twitter.com/indygreg">@indygreg</a> to engage with me there. Join
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyoxidizer-users">pyoxidizer-users mailing list</a>.
While I feel PyOxidizer is usable today (that's why I'm announcing it),
<strong>I need your feedback to help guide future prioritization.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I know PyOxidizer has significant implications for some
companies and projects that use Python. While I'm not looking to
enrich myself or make my livelihood from PyOxidizer, if PyOxidizer is
useful to you and you'd like to send money my way as appreciation, you
can do so <a href="https://www.patreon.com/indygreg">on Patreon</a> or

If not, that's totally fine: I wouldn't be making PyOxidizer open source
if I didn't want to share it with the world for free! And I am
financially well off as well. I just feel like there should be
more financial contribution to open source because it would improve
the health of the ecosystem and I can help achieve that end by
advocating for it and giving myself.</p>
<h2>Leveraging Rust</h2>
<p>The <em>oxidize</em> part of PyOxidizer comes from Rust (See the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust">Wikipedia Rust article</a> - for the
chemical not the programming language - to understand where <em>oxidize</em>
comes from.) The build time packaging and building functionality is
implemented in Rust. And the binary that embeds and controls the
Python interpreter in built applications is Rust code. Rationale for
these decisions is
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-rust">explained in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first non-toy project using Rust and I have to say that
Rust is... incredible! I may have to author a dedicated blog post
extolling the virtues of Rust. In short, Rust is now my go-to language
for systems level projects. Unless you need the target platform
versatility, I don't think C or C++ are defensibles choices in 2019 given
their security deficiencies. Languages like Go, Java, and various JVM
or CLR languages are acceptable if you can tolerate having a garbage
collector and/or a larger runtime. But what makes Rust superior in my
mind is the ability for the compiler to prevent large classes of
software bugs (especially those that turn into CVEs) and inefficiencies that
have plagued our industry for decades. <strong>Rust is the first programming
language I've used where I feel like the language itself, the compiler,
the tools around it (cargo, rustfmt, clippy, rustup, etc), and the
community surrounding it all actually care about and assist me with
writing high quality software. Nothing else I've used comes even close.</strong></p>
<p>What I've been most surprised about Rust is how high level it feels
for a systems level language that isn't garbage collected. When you
program lower-level languages like C or C++, compared to a higher level
language like Python, you have to type a lot more and be more explicit
in nearly everything you do. While Rust is certainly not as expressive
or compact as say Python, it is far, far closer to Python than I was
expecting it to be. Yes, you do have to type more and think more about
your code to appease the Rust compiler's constraints. But the return
on that investment is the compiler preventing entire classes of bugs
and C/C++ levels of performance. When I started PyOxidizer, the build
time logic was implemented in Python and only the run-time pieces were
in Rust. <strong>After learning a bit more Rust and realizing the obvious
code quality benefits, I ditched Python and adopted Rust for the build
time logic.</strong> And as the code base has grown and gone through various
refactorings, I am so glad I did so! The Rust compiler has caught
dozens of would-be bugs in Python. Granted, many of these can be
attributed to having strong typing and compile time type checking and
Rust is little different than say Java on this front. But a significant
number of prevented bugs covered invariants in the code because of the
way Rust's type system often intersects with control flow. e.g. <code>match</code>
arms must be exhaustive, so you can't have unhandled values/types and
unchecked <code>Result</code> instances result ina compiler warning. And clippy
has been just fantastic helping to guide me towards writing more
<em>acceptable</em> code following community accepted best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Even though PyOxidizer is implemented in Rust, most end-users shouldn't
have to care</strong> (beyond having to install a Rust compiler and build
PyOxidizer from source). The existence of Rust should be abstracted
away from Python packagers. I did this on purpose because I believe that
users of an application shouldn't have to care about the technical
implementation of that application. It is a bit unfortunate that I
force users to install Rust before using PyOxidizer, but in my defense
the target audience is technically savvy developers, bootstrapping Rust
is easy, and PyOxidizer is young, so I think it is acceptble for now.
If people get hung up on it, I can provide pre-compiled <code>pyoxidizer</code>
executables.</p>
<p>But if you do know Rust, PyOxidizer being implemented in Rust opens
up some exciting possibilities!</p>
<p><strong>One exciting possibility with PyOxidizer is the ability to add Rust
code to your Python application.</strong> PyOxidizer works by generating a
default Rust application (<code>main.rs</code>) that simply instantiates and runs
an embedded Python interpreter then exits. It essentially does what
<code>python</code> or a Python script would do. The key takeaway here is your
<em>Python application</em> is technically a <em>Rust application</em> (in the same
way that <code>python</code> is technically a <em>C application</em>). And being a
Rust application means you can add Rust code to that application. You
can modify the autogenerated <code>main.rs</code> to do things before, during, and
after the embedded Python interpreter runs. It's a regular Rust program
and can do anything that Rust programs can do!</p>
<p>Another possibility - and variant of above - is embedding Python
in existing Rust projects. PyOxidizer's mechanism for embedding a
Python interpreter is implemented as a standalone Rust crate. <strong>One
can add the pyembed crate to an existing Rust project and a little of
build system magic later, your Rust project can now embed and run
a Python interpreter!</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of potential for hybrid Rust + Python programs. And
I am <strong>very</strong> excited about the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a Rust programmer, PyOxidizer allows you to easily embed
Python in your Rust application. If you are a Python programmer,
PyOxidizer allows your to easily leverage Rust in your Python
application.</strong> In short, the package ecosystem of the other becomes
available to you. And if you aren't familiar with Rust, there are some
potentially crazy possibilities. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is a GPU accelerated
terminal emulator written in Rust and
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> is an entire web browser
engine written in Rust. With PyOxidizer, you could integrate a
terminal emulator or browser engine as part of your Python
application if you really wanted to. And, yes, Rust's packaging
tools are so good that stuff like this tends to <em>just work</em>. As
a concrete example, the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool contains <code>libgit2</code>
for performing in-process interactions with Git repositories. Adding
this required a single line change to a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and it
<em>just worked</em> on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Stuff like this often
takes hours to days to integrate in C/C++. It is quite ridiculous
how easy it is to add (complex) components to Rust projects!</p>
<p>For years, Python projects have implemented extensions in C to
realize performance wins. If your Python application is a Rust
executable, then implementing this functionality in Rust (rather
than C) seems rationale. So we may see <em>oxidized</em> Python
applications have their performance critical pieces slowly be
rewritten in Rust. (Honestly, the Rust crates to interface between
Rust and the CPython API still leave a bit to be desired, so the
experience of writing this Rust code still isn't great. But things
will certainly improve over time.)</p>
<p>This type of <em>inside-out</em> split language work has been practiced
in Python for years. What PyOxidizer brings to the table is the
ability to more easily port code <em>outside-in</em>. For example, you
could implement performance-criticial, early application logic such
as config file parsing and command line argument parsing in Rust.
You could then have Rust service some application functionality
without Python. Why would you want this? Performance is a valid
reason. Starting a Python interpreter, importing modules, and running
code can consume several dozen or even hundreds of milliseconds. If
you are writing performance sensitive applications, the existence
of <em>any</em> Python can add enough latency that people no longer perceive
the interaction as instananeous. This added latency can make Python
totally inappropriate for some contexts, such as for programs that run
as part of populating your shell's prompt. Writing such code in Rust
instead of Python dramatically increases the probability that the
code is fast and likely delivers stronger correctness guarantees
courtesy of Rust's compile time validation as well!</p>
<p>An extreme practice of <em>outside-in</em> porting of Python to Rust would
be to incrementally rewrite an entire Python application in Rust.
Rust's ergonomics are exceptional and I do think we'll see people
choose Rust where they previously would have chosen Python. I've
done this myself with PyOxidizer and feel it is a very defensible
decision to reach! I feel a bit conflicted releasing a tool which
may undermine Python's popularity by encouraging use of Rust over
Python. But at the end of the day, PyOxidizer increases the utility
of both Python and Rust by giving each more readily accessible
access to the other and PyOxidizer improves the overall utility of
Python by improving the application distribution story. I have no
doubt PyOxidizer is a net benefit for the Python ecosystem, even if
it does help usher in more people choosing Rust over Python. If
I have an ulterior motive in developing PyOxidizer, it is to enable
Mercurial's official distribution to be a Rust executable and
for some functionality (like <code>hg status</code>) to be runnable without
Python (for performance reasons).</p>
<p>Another possible use of PyOxidizer is as a library. All the build time
functionality of PyOxidizer exists in a Rust crate. So, you can add
the <code>pyoxidizer</code> crate to your own Rust project and use its code to
do things like build a library containing Python, compile Python
source modules to bytecode, or walk a directory tree and find Python
resources within. The code is still heavily geared towards PyOxidizer
and there's no promise of API stability. But this potential for library
usage exists and if others want to experiment with building custom
Python binaries not using the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool, using PyOxidizer
as a library might save you a lot of time.</p>
<h2>Standalone Python Distributions</h2>
<p>One of the most time consuming parts of building PyOxidizer was
figuring out how to build self-contained Python distributions.
Typically, a Python build consists of a library, shared libraries for
various extension modules, shared libraries required by the prior
items, and a hodgepodge of other files, such as .py files implementing
the Python standard library. The
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
project was created to automate creating special builds of Python
which are self-contained and distributable. This requires doing
dirty things with build systems. But I don't want to inflict the
details on you here. What I do think is worth mentioning is how
those Python distributions are distributed. The output of the
build is a tarball containing the Python installation, build artifacts
that can be used to link a custom libpython, and a <code>PYTHON.json</code>
file describing the contents of the distribution. PyOxidizer reads
the <code>PYTHON.json</code> file and learns how it should interact with that
distribution. <strong>If you produce a Python distribution conforming to the
format that <code>python-build-standalone</code> defines, you can use that
Python with PyOxidizer.</strong></p>
<p>While I have no urgency to do so at this time, I could see a future
where this Python distribution format is standardized. Then maintainers
of various Python distributions (CPython, PyPy, etc) would independently
produce their own distributable artifacts conforming to this standard,
in turn allowing machine consumers of Python distributions (such as
PyOxidizer) to easily consume different Python distributions and do
interesting things with them. You could even imagine these Python
distribution archives being readily available as packages in your
system's package manager and their locations exposed via the
<code>sysconfig</code> Python module, making it easy for tools (like PyOxidizer)
to find and use them.</p>
<p>Over time, I could see PyOxidizer's functionality rolling up into
official packaging tools like <code>pip</code>, which would know how to consume
the distribution archives and produce an executable containing a
Python interpreter, required Python modules, etc.</p>
<p>Getting PyOxidizer's functionality rolled into official Python
packaging tools is likely years away (if it ever happens). But I think
standardizing a format describing a Python distribution and (optionally)
contains build artifacts that can be used to <em>repackage</em> it is a
prerequisite and would be a good place to start this journey. I would
certainly love for Python distributions (like CPython) to be in charge of
producing official <em>repackagable</em> distributions because this is not
something I want to be in the business of doing long term (I'm
lazy, less equipped to make the correct decisions, and there are
various trust and security concerns). And while I'm here, I am
definitely interested in upstreaming some of the
<code>python-build-standalone</code> functionality into the existing CPython
build system because coercing CPython's build system to produce
distributable binaries is currently a major pain and I'd love to enable
others to do this. I just haven't had time nor do I know if the patches
would be well received. If a CPython maintainer wants to get in
touch, I'd love to have a conversation!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started hacking on PyOxidizer in November 2018. After months
of chipping away at it, I think I finally have a useful utility
for some audiences. There's still a lot of missing features and
some rough edges. But the core functionality is there and I'm
convinced that PyOxidizer or its underlying technology could be
an integral part of solving Python's application distribution
<em>black swan</em> problem. I'm particularly proud of the hacks I
concocted to coerce Python into importing module bytecode from
memory using zero-copy. Those are documented in
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">this blog post</a>
and in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/master/pyoxidizer/src/pyembed/lib.rs">pyembed crate docs</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation</a>,
install PyOxidizer, and let me know how it goes by
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy <em>oxidizing</em> your Python applications!</p>
