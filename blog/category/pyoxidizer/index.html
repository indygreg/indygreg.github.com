  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I am very pleased to announce the 0.7 release of
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyOxidizer</a>, a modern
Python application packaging tool.</p>
<p>There are a host of notable new features in this release. You can
read all about them in the project
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>I want to use this blog post to call out the more meaningful ones.</p>
<p>I started PyOxidizer as a science experiment of sorts: I sat out to
prove the hypothesis that it was possible to produce high performance
single file executables embedding Python and all of its resources
(Python modules, non-module resource files, compiled extensions, etc).
PyOxidizer has achieved this on Windows, Linux, and macOS since its
very earliest releases. Hypothesis confirmed!</p>
<p>In order to actually achieve single file executables, you have to
fundamentally change aspects of Python's behavior. Some of these
changes invalidate deeply rooted assumptions about how Python works,
such as the existence of <code>__file__</code> in modules. As you can imagine,
these broken assumptions translated to numerous compatibility issues
and PyOxidizer didn't work with many popular Python packages.</p>
<p>With the science experiment phase of PyOxidizer out of the way, I
have been making a concerted effort to broaden the user base of
PyOxidizer. While single file executables can be an amazing property,
it isn't critical for many use cases and the issues it was causing
were preventing people from exploring PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>This brings us to what I think are the major new features in
PyOxidizer 0.7.</p>
<h2>Better Support for Loading Extension Modules</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer insisted that you compile Python
(C) extension modules from source and statically link them into
a produced binary. This requirement prevented the use of pre-built
extension modules (commonly found in Python binary wheels available
on PyPI) with PyOxidizer, forcing people to compile them locally.
While this often <em>just worked</em> for many extension modules, it
frequently failed on complex extension modules and it frequently
failed on Windows.</p>
<p>PyOxidizer now supports loading compiled extension modules from
standalone files (typically <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code> files, which are actually
shared libraries). There are still some sharp edges and known
deficiencies. But in many cases, if you tell PyOxidizer to run
<code>pip install</code> and package the result, pre-built wheels can be
installed and PyOxidizer will pick up the standalone files.</p>
<p>On Windows, PyOxidizer even supports embedding the shared library
data into the produced <code>.exe</code> and loading the <code>.pyd</code>/DLL directly
from memory.</p>
<h2>Loading Resources from the Filesystem</h2>
<p>Binaries built with PyOxidizer contain a blob holding an index
of available Python resources along with their data.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of PyOxidizer only allowed you to define resources
as <em>in-memory</em>. If the resource was defined in this blob, it was
imported from memory. Otherwise it wasn't known to PyOxidizer.
You could still install files next to the produced binary and
tell PyOxidizer to enable Python's default filesystem-based
importer. But PyOxidizer didn't explicitly know about these
files on the filesystem.</p>
<p>In PyOxidizer 0.7, the blob index of Python resources is able to
express different <em>locations</em> for that resource. Currently, a
resource can have its data made available <em>in-memory</em> or
<em>filesystem-relative</em>. <em>in-memory</em> works as before: the raw
data is embedded next to the next in memory and loaded from
there (using 0-copy). <em>filesystem-relative</em> encodes a filesystem
path to the resource. During packaging, PyOxidizer will place
the resource next to the executable (using a typical Python
file layout scheme) and store the relative path to that resource
in the resources index.</p>
<p>The <em>filesystem-relative</em> resource indexing feature has a few
implications for PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>First, it is more standard. When PyOxidizer loads a Python
module from the filesystem, it sets <code>__file__</code>, <code>__path__</code>,
etc and the module semantics should behave as if the file
were imported by Python's standard importer. This means that
if a package is having issues with <em>in-memory</em> importing, you
can simply fall back to <em>filesystem-relative</em> to get standard
Python behavior and everything should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>Second, PyOxidizer's filesystem resource loading is faster
than Python's! When Python's standard importer goes to
<code>import</code> a module, it needs to <code>stat()</code> various paths to
first locate the file. It then performs some sanity checking
and other minor actions before actually importing the module.
All of this has overhead. Since the goal of PyOxidizer is
to produce standalone applications and applications should
be immutable, PyOxidizer can avoid most of this overhead.
PyOxidizer simply tries to <code>open()</code> and <code>read()</code> the relative
path baked into the resource index at build time. If that
works, the resource is loaded. Else there is a failure.
The code path in PyOxidizer to locate a Python resource
is effectively a lookup in a Rust <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;str, T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to isolate the performance
benefits of this new feature. I ran Mercurial's test harness
with different variants of <code>hg</code> on Linux on my Ryzen 3950X.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>traditional</em> - A <code>hg</code> script with a <code>#!/path/to/python3.7</code> shebang.</li>
<li><em>oxidized</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer, without
  PyOxidizer's custom module importer.</li>
<li><em>filesystem</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer using the
  new filesystem-relative resource index.</li>
<li><em>in-memory</em> - A <code>hg</code> executable built with PyOxidizer with all
  resources loaded from memory (how PyOxidizer has traditionally worked).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are quite clear:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variant</th><th>CPU Time (s)</th><th>Delta (s)</th><th>% Orig</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>traditional</td><td style="text-align: right">11,287</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">100</td></tr>
    <tr><td>oxidized</td><td style="text-align: right">10,735</td><td style="text-align: right">-552</td><td style="text-align: right">95.1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>filesystem</td><td style="text-align: right">10,186</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,101</td><td style="text-align: right">90.2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>in-memory</td><td style="text-align: right">9,883</td><td style="text-align: right">-1,404</td><td style="text-align: right">87.6</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We see a nice win just from using a native executable built
with PyOxidizer (<em>traditional</em> to <em>oxidized</em>).</p>
<p>Then from <em>oxidized</em> to <em>filesystem</em> we see another jump of
~5%. This difference is attributed to using PyOxidizer's
Rust-powered importer with an index of resources available
on the filesystem. In other words, all that work that Python's
standard importer is doing to discover files and then operate
on them is non-trivial!</p>
<p>Finally, the smaller jump from <em>filesystem</em> to <em>in-memory</em>
isolates the benefits of importing resource data from
memory instead of involving filesystem I/O. (Filesystems
are generally slow.) While I haven't measured explicitly,
I hypothesize that macOS and Windows will see a bigger
jump between these two variants, as the filesystem
performance on these platforms generally isn't as good
as it is on Linux.</p>
<h2>PyOxidizer's Future</h2>
<p>With PyOxidizer now supporting a couple of much-needed
features to support a broader set of users, I'm hoping that
future releases of PyOxidizer continue to broaden the utility
of PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>The over-arching goal of PyOxidizer is to solve large aspects
of the Python application packaging and distribution problem.
So far a lot of focus has been spent on the former. PyOxidizer
in its current form can materialize files on the filesystem
that you can copy or package up manually and distribute. But
I want these processes to be part of PyOxidizer: I want it to
be possible for PyOxidizer to emit a Windows MSI installer, a
macOS dmg, a Debian package, etc for a Python application.</p>
<p>In order to support the aforementioned marquee features
of this PyOxidizer release, I had to pay down a lot of
technical debt in the code base left over from the science
experiment phase of PyOxidizer's inception.</p>
<p>In the short term, I plan to continue shoring up the code base
and rounding out support for features requested in the
issue tracker on GitHub. The next release of PyOxidizer will
also <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/234">likely require</a>
Python 3.8, as this will improve run-time control over the
embedded Python interpreter and enable PyOxidizer to better
support package metadata (<code>importlib.metadata</code>), enabling
support for features like <em>entry points</em>.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about extracting PyOxidizer's custom
module importer to be usable as a standalone Python extension
module. I think there's some value in publishing a
<code>pyoxidizer_importer</code> package on PyPI that you can easily
add to your installed packages to speed up Python's
standard filesystem importer by a few percent. If nothing else,
this may drum up interest in the larger Python community for
standardizing a format for serializing Python resources in a
single file. Perhaps we can get other Python packaging tools
producing the same
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/python-packed-resources">packed resources data</a>
blob that PyOxidizer uses so we can all standardize on a
more efficient mechanism for loading Python modules. Time
will tell.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new release. File issues at

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The <a href="/blog/2019/06/24/building-standalone-python-applications-with-pyoxidizer/">initial release</a>
of PyOxidizer generated a bit of excitement across the Internet! The post was
commented on heavily in various forums and my phone was constantly buzzing from
all the Twitter activity. There has been a steady stream of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">GitHub Issues</a> for the project,
which I consider a good sign. So thank you everybody for the support and
encouragement! And especially thank you to everyone who filed an issue or
submitted a pull request!</p>
<p>While I don't usually read the comments, I was looking at various forums
posting about PyOxidizer to see what reactions were like. A common negative
theme was the lack of C extension support in PyOxidizer. People seemed
dismissive of PyOxidizer because it didn't support C extensions. Despite the
documentation stating that the feature was planned and that I had an idea for
how to implement it, people seemed pessimistic. Perhaps I didn't adequately
communicate that making C extensions work is actually a subset of the
already-solved <em>single file executable</em> problem and therefore was already
a <em>solved problem</em> at the technical level (only the integration with the
Python and PyOxidizer <em>build systems</em> was missing). So in my mind C
extension support was only a matter of time and the only open question was
how many hacks would be needed to make it work, not <em>whether</em> it would work.</p>
<p>Well, I'm pleased to report that <strong>the just-released version 0.2 of PyOxidizer
supports C extensions on Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong>. If you install a Python
package through a <code>pip-install-simple</code>, <code>pip-requirements-file</code>, or
<code>setup-py-install</code> packaging rule, C extensions will be compiled in a special
way that enables them to be embedded in the same binary containing Python
itself. I've tested it with the <code>zope.interface</code>, <code>zstandard</code>, and
<code>mercurial</code> packages and it seems to work (although Mercurial has other
issues that prevent it from being packaged as a PyOxidizer application - but
the C extensions do compile).</p>
<p>There are some
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html#native-extension-modules">limitations</a>
to the support, however. I'm pretty confident the limitations can be eliminated
given enough time. Given how many people were hung up on the lack of C extensions
and were seemingly writing off PyOxidizer thinking it was snake oil or something,
I wanted to deliver basic C extension support to curtail this line of criticism.
Perfect is the enemy of good and hopefully basic C extension support is good
enough to ease concerns about PyOxidizer's viability.</p>
<p>Also in PyOxidizer 0.2 are some minor new features, like the <code>--pip-install</code> and
<code>--python-code</code> flags to <code>pyoxidizer init</code>. These allow you to generate a
<code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file pre-configured to install some packages from pip and run
custom Python code. So now applications can be created and built with a one-liner
without having to edit a <code>pyoxidizer.toml</code> file!</p>
<p>The full release notes <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html">are available</a>.
As always, please keep
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>. I'm particularly
interested in hearing about packages whose C extensions don't work properly.</p>

  <p>Python application distribution is generally considered an unsolved
problem. At their PyCon 2019 keynote talk, Russel Keith-Magee
<a href="https://youtu.be/ftP5BQh1-YM?t=2033">identified code distribution</a> as
a potential <em>black swan</em> - an existential threat for longevity - for
Python. In their words, <em>Python hasn't ever had a consistent story for
how I give my code to someone else, especially if that someone else
isn't a developer and just wants to use my application.</em> I completely
agree. And I want to add my opinion that unless your target user is a
Python developer, they shouldn't need to know anything about Python
packaging, Python itself, or even the existence of Python in order to
use your application. (And you can replace <em>Python</em> in the previous
sentence with any programming language or software technology: most
end-users don't care about the technical implementation, they just
want to get stuff done.)</p>
<p>Today, I'm excited to announce the first release of PyOxidizer
(<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">project</a>,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>), an open
source utility that aims to solve the Python application distribution
problem! (The installation instructions are in the docs.)</p>
<h2>Standalone Single File, No Dependencies Executable Python Applications</h2>
<p><strong>PyOxidizer's marquee feature is that it can produce a single file
executable containing a fully-featured Python interpreter, its
extensions, standard library, and your application's modules and
resources.</strong> In other words, you can have a single <code>.exe</code> providing
your application. And unlike other tools in this space which tend to
be operating system specific, PyOxidizer works across platforms
(currently Windows, macOS, and Linux - the most popular platforms for
Python today). Executables built with PyOxidizer have minimal
dependencies on the host environment nor do they do anything
complicated at run-time. I believe PyOxidizer is the only open
source tool to have all these attributes.</p>
<p><strong>On Linux, it is possible to build a fully statically linked executable.</strong>
You can drop this executable into a chroot or container where it is the
only file and it will <em>just work</em>. On macOS and Windows, the only
library dependencies are on always-present or extremely common
libraries. More details are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributing.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>At execution time, binaries built with PyOxidizer do not do anything
special to run the Python interpreter. (Other tools in this space do
things like create a temporary directory or SquashFS filesystem and
extract Python to it.) <strong>PyOxidizer loads everything from memory and there
is no explicit I/O being performed. When you <code>import</code> a Python module,
the bytecode for that module is being loaded from a memory address in
the executable using zero-copy.</strong> This makes PyOxidizer executables
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#faster-python-programs">faster</a>
to start and <code>import</code> - faster than a <code>python</code> executable itself!</p>
<h2>Current Release and Future Roadmap</h2>
<p>Today's release of PyOxidizer is just the first release milestone in
what I envision is a long and successful project history. While my
over-arching goal with PyOxidizer is to <em>solve</em> vast swaths of the
Python application distribution problem, I want to be clear that this
first release comes nowhere close to doing so. I toiled with what
features <em>must</em> be in the initial release. I ultimately decided that
PyOxidizer's current functionality is extremely valuable to <em>some</em>
audiences and that the project has matured to the point where more
eyeballs and users would substantially help its development. (I could
definitely use some help prioritizing which features to work on and
for that I need users and user feedback.)</p>
<p>In today's release, PyOxidizer is good at producing executables
embedding Python. It doesn't yet venture too far into the <em>distribution</em>
part of the problem (I want it to be trivial to produce MSI installers,
DMG images, deb/rpm packages, etc). But on Linux, this is already a huge
step forward because PyOxidizer makes it easy (hopefully!) to produce
binaries that should <em>just work</em> on other machines. (Anyone who has
attempted to distribute Linux applications will tell you how painful this
problem can be.)</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, I believe today's release of PyOxidizer to
be a viable tool for some applications. And I believe PyOxidizer can
start to replace existing tools in this space. (See the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparisons.html">Comparisons to Other Tools</a>
document for how PyOxidizer compares to other Python packaging and
distribution tools.)</p>
<p>Using today's release of PyOxidizer, larger user-facing applications
using Python (like Dropbox, <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>,
<a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a>, etc) could use
PyOxidizer to produce self-contained executables. This would likely cut
down on installer size, decrease install/update time (fewer files means
faster operations), and hopefully make packaging simpler for application
maintainers. Maintainers of Python utilities could produce self-contained
executables, making their utilities faster to start and easier to
package and distribute.</p>
<h2>New Possibilities and Reliability for Python</h2>
<p>By enabling support for self-contained, single file Python applications,
PyOxidizer opens exciting new doors for Python. Because Python has
historically required an explicit, separate runtime not part of the
executable, Python was not viable (or was a hinderance) in many domains.
For example, if you wanted to use Python to <em>bootstrap</em> a fresh server
or empty container environment, you had a chicken-and-egg problem because
you needed to install Python before you could use it.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> for example. One of Ansible's
features is that it remotes into a machine and runs things. The way
it does this is it dynamically generates Python scripts locally, uploads
them to the remote machine, and tells the remote to execute them. Those
Python scripts require the existence of a Python interpreter on the
remote machine. This means you need to install Python on a machine before
you can control it with Ansible. Furthermore, because the remote's Python
isn't under Ansible's control, you can assume very little about its behavior
and capabilities, making interaction a bit brittle.</p>
<p>Using PyOxidizer, projects like Ansible could produce a self-contained
executable containing a Python interpreter. They could transfer that
single binary to the remote machine and execute it, instantly giving the
remote machine access to a fully-featured and modern Python interpreter.
From there, the sky is the limit. In Ansible's case, the executable could
contain the full Ansible runtime, along with any 3rd party Python
packages they wanted to leverage. This would allow execution to occur
(possibly mostly independently) on the remote machine. This architecture
is simpler, scales better, would likely result in faster operations, and
would probably improve the quality of life for everyone involved, from
application developers to its end users.</p>
<p><strong>Self-contained Python applications built with PyOxidizer essentially
solve the <em>Python interpreter bootstrapping and reliability</em> problems.</strong>
By providing a Python interpreter and a known set of Python modules, you
provide a highly deterministic and reliable execution environment for your
application. You don't need to fret about which version of Python
is installed: you <em>know</em> which version of Python you are using.
You don't need to worry about which Python packages are installed:
you control explicitly which packages are available. You don't need to
worry about whether you are running in a virtualenv, what <code>sys.path</code>
is set to, whether <code>.pth</code> files come into play, whether various
<code>PYTHON*</code> environment variables can mess up your application, whether
some Linux distribution packaged Python differently, what to put in your
script's <em>shebang</em>, etc: executables built with PyOxidizer behave as
you have instructed them to because they are <em>compiled</em> that way.</p>
<p>All of the concerns in the previous paragraph contribute to a larger
problem in the eyes of application maintainers that can be summarized as
<em>Python isn't reliable</em>. And because <em>Python isn't reliable</em>, many
people reach the conclusion that <em>Python shouldn't be used</em> (this is the
<em>black swan</em> that was referred to earlier). With PyOxidizer, the Python
environment is isolated and highly deterministic making the
reliability problem largely go away. This makes Python a more viable
technology choice. And it enables application maintainers to aggressively
adopt modern Python versions, utilize third party packages fearlessly,
and spend far less time chasing an extremely long tail of issues related
to Python environment variance. Succinctly, application developers can
focus on building great applications instead of toiling with Python
environment problems.</p>
<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>PyOxidizer is still in its relative infancy. While it is far from
feature complete, I'm mentally committed to working on the remaining
major functionality. The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html">Status</a>
document lists major missing functionality, lesser missing functionality,
and potential future value-add functionality.</p>
<p>I want PyOxidizer to provide a Python application packaging and
distribution experience that <em>just works</em> with minimal cognitive effort
from Python application maintainers. I have spent a lot of effort
documenting PyOxidizer. I care passionately about user experience and want
everything about PyOxidizer to be simple and frustration free. I
know things aren't there yet. The problems that PyOxidizer is attempting
to solve are hard (that's a reason nobody has solved them well yet). I
know there's details floating around in my head that haven't been
added to the documentation yet. I know there's missing features and
bugs in PyOxidizer. I know there are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_pitfalls.html">Packaging Pitfalls</a>
yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to make PyOxidizer great.</strong> I encourage Python
application maintainers reading this to head over to

While I feel PyOxidizer is usable today (that's why I'm announcing it),
<strong>I need your feedback to help guide future prioritization.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, I know PyOxidizer has significant implications for some
companies and projects that use Python. While I'm not looking to

<h2>Leveraging Rust</h2>
<p>The <em>oxidize</em> part of PyOxidizer comes from Rust (See the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust">Wikipedia Rust article</a> - for the
chemical not the programming language - to understand where <em>oxidize</em>
comes from.) The build time packaging and building functionality is
implemented in Rust. And the binary that embeds and controls the
Python interpreter in built applications is Rust code. Rationale for
these decisions is
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-rust">explained in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first non-toy project using Rust and I have to say that
Rust is... incredible! I may have to author a dedicated blog post
extolling the virtues of Rust. In short, Rust is now my go-to language
for systems level projects. Unless you need the target platform
versatility, I don't think C or C++ are defensibles choices in 2019 given
their security deficiencies. Languages like Go, Java, and various JVM
or CLR languages are acceptable if you can tolerate having a garbage
collector and/or a larger runtime. But what makes Rust superior in my
mind is the ability for the compiler to prevent large classes of
software bugs (especially those that turn into CVEs) and inefficiencies that
have plagued our industry for decades. <strong>Rust is the first programming
language I've used where I feel like the language itself, the compiler,
the tools around it (cargo, rustfmt, clippy, rustup, etc), and the
community surrounding it all actually care about and assist me with
writing high quality software. Nothing else I've used comes even close.</strong></p>
<p>What I've been most surprised about Rust is how high level it feels
for a systems level language that isn't garbage collected. When you
program lower-level languages like C or C++, compared to a higher level
language like Python, you have to type a lot more and be more explicit
in nearly everything you do. While Rust is certainly not as expressive
or compact as say Python, it is far, far closer to Python than I was
expecting it to be. Yes, you do have to type more and think more about
your code to appease the Rust compiler's constraints. But the return
on that investment is the compiler preventing entire classes of bugs
and C/C++ levels of performance. When I started PyOxidizer, the build
time logic was implemented in Python and only the run-time pieces were
in Rust. <strong>After learning a bit more Rust and realizing the obvious
code quality benefits, I ditched Python and adopted Rust for the build
time logic.</strong> And as the code base has grown and gone through various
refactorings, I am so glad I did so! The Rust compiler has caught
dozens of would-be bugs in Python. Granted, many of these can be
attributed to having strong typing and compile time type checking and
Rust is little different than say Java on this front. But a significant
number of prevented bugs covered invariants in the code because of the
way Rust's type system often intersects with control flow. e.g. <code>match</code>
arms must be exhaustive, so you can't have unhandled values/types and
unchecked <code>Result</code> instances result ina compiler warning. And clippy
has been just fantastic helping to guide me towards writing more
<em>acceptable</em> code following community accepted best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Even though PyOxidizer is implemented in Rust, most end-users shouldn't
have to care</strong> (beyond having to install a Rust compiler and build
PyOxidizer from source). The existence of Rust should be abstracted
away from Python packagers. I did this on purpose because I believe that
users of an application shouldn't have to care about the technical
implementation of that application. It is a bit unfortunate that I
force users to install Rust before using PyOxidizer, but in my defense
the target audience is technically savvy developers, bootstrapping Rust
is easy, and PyOxidizer is young, so I think it is acceptble for now.
If people get hung up on it, I can provide pre-compiled <code>pyoxidizer</code>
executables.</p>
<p>But if you do know Rust, PyOxidizer being implemented in Rust opens
up some exciting possibilities!</p>
<p><strong>One exciting possibility with PyOxidizer is the ability to add Rust
code to your Python application.</strong> PyOxidizer works by generating a
default Rust application (<code>main.rs</code>) that simply instantiates and runs
an embedded Python interpreter then exits. It essentially does what
<code>python</code> or a Python script would do. The key takeaway here is your
<em>Python application</em> is technically a <em>Rust application</em> (in the same
way that <code>python</code> is technically a <em>C application</em>). And being a
Rust application means you can add Rust code to that application. You
can modify the autogenerated <code>main.rs</code> to do things before, during, and
after the embedded Python interpreter runs. It's a regular Rust program
and can do anything that Rust programs can do!</p>
<p>Another possibility - and variant of above - is embedding Python
in existing Rust projects. PyOxidizer's mechanism for embedding a
Python interpreter is implemented as a standalone Rust crate. <strong>One
can add the pyembed crate to an existing Rust project and a little of
build system magic later, your Rust project can now embed and run
a Python interpreter!</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of potential for hybrid Rust + Python programs. And
I am <strong>very</strong> excited about the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a Rust programmer, PyOxidizer allows you to easily embed
Python in your Rust application. If you are a Python programmer,
PyOxidizer allows your to easily leverage Rust in your Python
application.</strong> In short, the package ecosystem of the other becomes
available to you. And if you aren't familiar with Rust, there are some
potentially crazy possibilities. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is a GPU accelerated
terminal emulator written in Rust and
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> is an entire web browser
engine written in Rust. With PyOxidizer, you could integrate a
terminal emulator or browser engine as part of your Python
application if you really wanted to. And, yes, Rust's packaging
tools are so good that stuff like this tends to <em>just work</em>. As
a concrete example, the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool contains <code>libgit2</code>
for performing in-process interactions with Git repositories. Adding
this required a single line change to a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and it
<em>just worked</em> on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Stuff like this often
takes hours to days to integrate in C/C++. It is quite ridiculous
how easy it is to add (complex) components to Rust projects!</p>
<p>For years, Python projects have implemented extensions in C to
realize performance wins. If your Python application is a Rust
executable, then implementing this functionality in Rust (rather
than C) seems rationale. So we may see <em>oxidized</em> Python
applications have their performance critical pieces slowly be
rewritten in Rust. (Honestly, the Rust crates to interface between
Rust and the CPython API still leave a bit to be desired, so the
experience of writing this Rust code still isn't great. But things
will certainly improve over time.)</p>
<p>This type of <em>inside-out</em> split language work has been practiced
in Python for years. What PyOxidizer brings to the table is the
ability to more easily port code <em>outside-in</em>. For example, you
could implement performance-criticial, early application logic such
as config file parsing and command line argument parsing in Rust.
You could then have Rust service some application functionality
without Python. Why would you want this? Performance is a valid
reason. Starting a Python interpreter, importing modules, and running
code can consume several dozen or even hundreds of milliseconds. If
you are writing performance sensitive applications, the existence
of <em>any</em> Python can add enough latency that people no longer perceive
the interaction as instananeous. This added latency can make Python
totally inappropriate for some contexts, such as for programs that run
as part of populating your shell's prompt. Writing such code in Rust
instead of Python dramatically increases the probability that the
code is fast and likely delivers stronger correctness guarantees
courtesy of Rust's compile time validation as well!</p>
<p>An extreme practice of <em>outside-in</em> porting of Python to Rust would
be to incrementally rewrite an entire Python application in Rust.
Rust's ergonomics are exceptional and I do think we'll see people
choose Rust where they previously would have chosen Python. I've
done this myself with PyOxidizer and feel it is a very defensible
decision to reach! I feel a bit conflicted releasing a tool which
may undermine Python's popularity by encouraging use of Rust over
Python. But at the end of the day, PyOxidizer increases the utility
of both Python and Rust by giving each more readily accessible
access to the other and PyOxidizer improves the overall utility of
Python by improving the application distribution story. I have no
doubt PyOxidizer is a net benefit for the Python ecosystem, even if
it does help usher in more people choosing Rust over Python. If
I have an ulterior motive in developing PyOxidizer, it is to enable
Mercurial's official distribution to be a Rust executable and
for some functionality (like <code>hg status</code>) to be runnable without
Python (for performance reasons).</p>
<p>Another possible use of PyOxidizer is as a library. All the build time
functionality of PyOxidizer exists in a Rust crate. So, you can add
the <code>pyoxidizer</code> crate to your own Rust project and use its code to
do things like build a library containing Python, compile Python
source modules to bytecode, or walk a directory tree and find Python
resources within. The code is still heavily geared towards PyOxidizer
and there's no promise of API stability. But this potential for library
usage exists and if others want to experiment with building custom
Python binaries not using the <code>pyoxidizer</code> CLI tool, using PyOxidizer
as a library might save you a lot of time.</p>
<h2>Standalone Python Distributions</h2>
<p>One of the most time consuming parts of building PyOxidizer was
figuring out how to build self-contained Python distributions.
Typically, a Python build consists of a library, shared libraries for
various extension modules, shared libraries required by the prior
items, and a hodgepodge of other files, such as .py files implementing
the Python standard library. The
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
project was created to automate creating special builds of Python
which are self-contained and distributable. This requires doing
dirty things with build systems. But I don't want to inflict the
details on you here. What I do think is worth mentioning is how
those Python distributions are distributed. The output of the
build is a tarball containing the Python installation, build artifacts
that can be used to link a custom libpython, and a <code>PYTHON.json</code>
file describing the contents of the distribution. PyOxidizer reads
the <code>PYTHON.json</code> file and learns how it should interact with that
distribution. <strong>If you produce a Python distribution conforming to the
format that <code>python-build-standalone</code> defines, you can use that
Python with PyOxidizer.</strong></p>
<p>While I have no urgency to do so at this time, I could see a future
where this Python distribution format is standardized. Then maintainers
of various Python distributions (CPython, PyPy, etc) would independently
produce their own distributable artifacts conforming to this standard,
in turn allowing machine consumers of Python distributions (such as
PyOxidizer) to easily consume different Python distributions and do
interesting things with them. You could even imagine these Python
distribution archives being readily available as packages in your
system's package manager and their locations exposed via the
<code>sysconfig</code> Python module, making it easy for tools (like PyOxidizer)
to find and use them.</p>
<p>Over time, I could see PyOxidizer's functionality rolling up into
official packaging tools like <code>pip</code>, which would know how to consume
the distribution archives and produce an executable containing a
Python interpreter, required Python modules, etc.</p>
<p>Getting PyOxidizer's functionality rolled into official Python
packaging tools is likely years away (if it ever happens). But I think
standardizing a format describing a Python distribution and (optionally)
contains build artifacts that can be used to <em>repackage</em> it is a
prerequisite and would be a good place to start this journey. I would
certainly love for Python distributions (like CPython) to be in charge of
producing official <em>repackagable</em> distributions because this is not
something I want to be in the business of doing long term (I'm
lazy, less equipped to make the correct decisions, and there are
various trust and security concerns). And while I'm here, I am
definitely interested in upstreaming some of the
<code>python-build-standalone</code> functionality into the existing CPython
build system because coercing CPython's build system to produce
distributable binaries is currently a major pain and I'd love to enable
others to do this. I just haven't had time nor do I know if the patches
would be well received. If a CPython maintainer wants to get in
touch, I'd love to have a conversation!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started hacking on PyOxidizer in November 2018. After months
of chipping away at it, I think I finally have a useful utility
for some audiences. There's still a lot of missing features and
some rough edges. But the core functionality is there and I'm
convinced that PyOxidizer or its underlying technology could be
an integral part of solving Python's application distribution
<em>black swan</em> problem. I'm particularly proud of the hacks I
concocted to coerce Python into importing module bytecode from
memory using zero-copy. Those are documented in
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">this blog post</a>
and in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/master/pyoxidizer/src/pyembed/lib.rs">pyembed crate docs</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation</a>,
install PyOxidizer, and let me know how it goes by
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues">filing issues</a>!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy <em>oxidizing</em> your Python applications!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few weeks ago I
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications">introduced PyOxidizer</a>,
a project that aims to make it easier to produce completely self-contained
executables embedding a Python interpreter (using Rust). A few days later I
<a href="/blog/2018/12/28/faster-in-memory-python-module-importing/">observed some PyOxidizer performance benefits</a>.</p>
<p>After a few more hacking sessions, I'm very pleased to report that
PyOxidizer is now working on Windows!</p>
<p>I am able to produce a standalone Windows <code>.exe</code> containing a fully
featured CPython interpreter, all its library dependencies (OpenSSL, SQLite,
liblzma, etc), and a copy of the Python standard library (both source and
bytecode data). The binary weighs in at around 25 MB. (It could be smaller
if we didn't embed <code>.py</code> source files or stripped some dependencies.)
The only DLL dependencies of the exe are <code>vcruntime140.dll</code> and various
system DLLs that are always present on Windows.</p>
<p>Like I did for Linux and macOS, I produced a Python script that performs
~500 <code>import</code> statements for the near entirety of the Python standard library.
I then ran this script with both the official 64-bit Python distribution
and an executable produced with PyOxidizer:</p>
<pre><code># Official CPython 3.7.2 Windows distribution.
$ time python.exe &lt; import_stdlib.py
real    0m0.475s

# PyOxidizer with non-PGO CPython 3.7.2
$ time target/release/pyapp.exe &lt; import_stdlib.py
real    0m0.347s
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to the official CPython distribution, a PyOxidizer executable
can import almost the entirety of the Python standard library ~125ms
faster - or ~73% of original. In terms of the percentage of speedup,
the gains are similar to Linux and macOS. However, there is substantial
new process overhead on Windows compared to POSIX architectures. On the
same machine, a <em>hello world</em> Python process will execute in ~10ms on Linux
and ~40ms on Windows. If we remove the startup overhead, importing
the Python standard library runs at ~70% of its original time, making
the relative speedup on par with that seen on macOS + APFS.</p>
<p>Windows support is a major milestone for PyOxidizer. And it was the
hardest platform to make work. CPython's build system on Windows uses
Visual Studio project files. And coercing the build system to produce
static libraries was a real pain. Lots of CPython's build tooling assumes
Python is built in a very specific manner and multiple changes I made
completely break those assumptions. On top of that, it's very easy to
encounter problems with symbol name mismatch due to the use of
<code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> and <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code>. I spent
several hours going down a rabbit hole learning how Rust generates symbols
on Windows for <code>extern {}</code> items. Unfortunately, we currently have
to use a Rust Nightly feature (the <code>static-nobundle</code> linkage kind)
to get things to work. But I <em>think</em> there are options to remove that
requirement.</p>
<p>Up to this point, my work on PyOxidizer has focused on prototyping the
concept. With Windows out of the way and PyOxidizer working on Linux,
macOS, and Windows, I have achieved confidence that my vision of a
single executable embedding a full-featured Python interpreter is
technically viable on major desktop platforms! (BSD people, I care
about you too. The solution for Linux should be portable to BSD.)
This means I can start focusing on features, usability, and optimization.
In other words, I can start building a tool that others will want to use.</p>

  <p>I <a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">recently blogged about</a>
distributing standalone Python applications. In that post, I announced
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a> - a tool which
leverages Rust to produce standalone executables embedding Python. One of the
features of PyOxidizer is the ability to import Python modules embedded
within the binary using zero-copy.</p>
<p>I also recently blogged about
<a href="/blog/2018/10/29/global-kernel-locks-in-apfs/">global kernel locks in APFS</a>,
which make filesystem operations slower on macOS. This was the latest wrinkle in
a long battle against Python's slow startup times, which I've posted about
on the official python-dev mailing list
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-May/134528.html">over</a>

<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">years</a>.</p>
<p>Since I announced PyOxidizer a few days ago, I've had some productive holiday
hacking sessions!</p>
<p>One of the reached milestones is PyOxidizer now supports macOS.</p>
<p>With that milestone reached, I thought it would be interesting to compare
the performance of a PyOxidizer executable versus a standard CPython build.</p>
<p>I produced a <a href="https://gist.github.com/indygreg/be1c229fa41ced5c76d912f7073f9de6">Python script</a>
that imports almost the entirety of the Python standard library - at least the
modules implemented in Python. That's 508 <code>import</code> statements. I then
executed this script using a typical <code>python3.7</code> binary (with the standard
library on the filesystem) and PyOxidizer-produced standalone executables
with a module importer that loads Python modules from memory using zero copy.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>First, the PyOxidizer times are all relatively similar regardless of whether
PGO or LTO is used to build CPython. That's not too surprising, as I'm
exercising a very limited subset of CPython (and I suspect the benefits
of PGO/LTO aren't as pronounced due to the nature of the CPython API).</p>
<p>But the bigger result is the obvious speedup with PyOxidizer and its
in-memory importing: <strong>PyOxidizer can import almost the entirety of the
Python standard library ~100ms faster - or ~70% of original - than a
typical standalone CPython install</strong> with a hot disk cache! This comes
out to ~0.19ms per <code>import</code> statement. If we run <code>purge</code> to clear out
the disk cache, the performance delta increases to 252ms, or ~64% of
original. All these numbers are on a 2018 6-core 2.9 GHz i9 MacBook Pro,
which has a pretty decent SSD.</p>
<p>And on Linux on an i7-6700K running in a Hyper-V VM:</p>
<pre><code># pyenv installed CPython 3.7.2

# Cold disk cache.
$ time ~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.2/bin/python &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.405s

# PyOxidizer with PGO CPython 3.7.2

$ time target/release/pyapp &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.152s
user   0m0.136s
sys    0m0.016s
</code></pre>
<p>On a hot disk cache, the run-time improvement of PyOxidizer is ~41ms, or
~78% of original. This comes out to ~0.08ms per <code>import</code> statement. When
flushing caches by writing <code>3</code> to <code>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>, the delta
increases to ~178ms, or ~56% of original.</p>
<p>Using <code>dtruss -c</code> to execute the binaries, the breakdown in system calls
occurring &gt;10 times is clear:</p>

<p>PyOxidizer avoids hundreds of <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>, <code>read()</code>,
<code>fstat64()</code>, and <code>stat64()</code> calls. And by avoiding these calls,
PyOxidizer not only avoids the userland-kernel overhead intrinsic to them,
but also any additional overhead that APFS is imposing via its global
lock(s).</p>
<p>(Why the PyOxidizer binary is making hundreds of calls to <code>getentropy()</code>
I'm not sure. It's definitely coming from Python as a side-effect of a
module import and it is something I'd like to fix, if possible.)</p>
<p>With this experiment, we finally have the ability to better isolate the
impact of filesystem overhead on Python module importing and preliminary
results indicate that the overhead is not insignificant - at least on the
tested systems (I'll get data for Windows when PyOxidizer supports it).
While the test is somewhat contrived (I don't think many applications import
the entirety of the Python standard library), some Python applications do
import hundreds of modules. And as I've
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-May/153296.html">written before</a>,
milliseconds matter. This is especially true if you are invoking Python
processes hundreds or thousands of times in a build system, when running
a test suite, for scripting, etc. Cumulatively you can be importing tens
of thousands of modules. So I think shaving even fractions of a
millisecond from module importing is important.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in addition to the system call overhead, CPython's
path-based importer runs
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/804a5d94b6b7f8cb8546112aee2bc3af362f28f5/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py">substantially more</a>
Python code
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/c50e63338abd08ebac86746a33d750756d622edc/pyrepackager/src/memoryimporter.py">than PyOxidizer</a>
and this likely contributes several milliseconds of overhead as well. Because
PyOxidizer applications are static, the importer can remain simple (finding a
module in PyOxidizer is essentially a Rust <code>HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> lookup).
While it might be useful to isolate the filesystem overhead from Python code
overhead, the thing that end-users care about is overall execution time: they
don't care where that overhead is coming from. So I think it is fair to compare
PyOxidizer - with its intrinsically simpler import model - with what Python
typically does (scan <code>sys.path</code> entries and looking for modules on the
filesystem).</p>
<p>Another difference is that PyOxidizer is almost completely statically linked.
By contrast, a typical CPython install has compiled extension modules as
standalone shared libraries and these shared libraries often link against
other shared libraries (such as libssl). From <code>dtruss</code> timing information,
I don't believe this difference contributes to significant overhead, however.</p>
<p>Finally, I haven't yet optimized PyOxidizer. I still have a few tricks up
my sleeve that can likely shave off more overhead from Python startup. But
so far the results are looking <em>very</em> promising. I dare say they are looking
promising enough that Python distributions themselves might want to look
into the area more thoroughly and consider distribution defaults that rely
less on the every-Python-module-is-a-separate-file model.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a>
updates in the near future!</p>
