  <p>I have a... complicated relationship with Git.</p>
<p>When Git first came onto the scene in the mid 2000's, I was initially
skeptical because of its horrible user interface. But once I learned
it, I appreciated its speed and features - especially the ease at which
you could create feature branches, merge, and even create commits
offline (which was a big deal in the era when Subversion was the
dominant version control tool in open source and you needed to speak with
a server in order to commit code). When I started using Git day-to-day,
it was such an obvious improvement over what I was using before (mainly
Subversion and even CVS).</p>
<p>When I started working for Mozilla in 2011, I was exposed to the
Mercurial version control, which then - and still today - hosts the
canonical repository for Firefox. I didn't like Mercurial initially.
Actually, I despised it. I thought it was slow and its features lacking.
And I frequently encountered repository corruption.</p>
<p>My first experience learning the <em>internals</em> of both Git and Mercurial
came when I found myself hacking on
<a href="http://hg-git.github.io/]">hg-git</a> - a tool that allows you to convert
Git and Mercurial repositories to/from each other. I was hacking on hg-git
so I could improve the performance of converting Mercurial repositories
to Git repositories. And I was doing that because I wanted to use Git -
not Mercurial - to hack on Firefox. I was trying to enable an unofficial
Git mirror of the Firefox repository to synchronize faster so it would
be more usable. The ulterior motive was to demonstrate that Git is a
superior version control tool and that Firefox should switch its canonical
version control tool from Mercurial to Git.</p>
<p>In what is a textbook definition of <em>irony</em>, what happened instead was
I actually learned how Mercurial worked, interacted with the Mercurial
Community, realized that Mozilla's documentation and developer practices
were... lacking, and that Mercurial was actually a much, much more
pleasant tool to use than Git. It's an old post, but I
<a href="/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercurial-(and-git)/">summarized my conversion</a>
four and a half years ago. This started a chain of events that somehow
resulted in me contributing a ton of patches to Mercurial, taking
stewardship of <em>hg.mozilla.org</em>, and becoming a member of the Mercurial
Steering Committee - the governance group for the Mercurial Project.</p>
<p>I've been an advocate of Mercurial over the years. Some would probably say
I'm a Mercurial fanboy. I reject that characterization because <em>fanboy</em> has
connotations that imply I'm ignorant of realities. I'm well aware of
Mercurial's faults and weaknesses. I'm well aware of Mercurial's relative
lack of popularity, I'm well aware that this lack of popularity almost
certainly turns away contributors to Firefox and other Mozilla projects
because people don't want to have to learn a new tool. I'm well aware that
there are changes underway to enable Git to scale to <em>very large
repositories</em> and that these changes could threaten Mercurial's scalability
advantages over Git, making choices to use Mercurial even harder to defend.
(As an aside, the party most responsible for pushing Git to adopt
architectural changes to enable it to scale these days is Microsoft.
Could anyone have foreseen that?!)</p>
<p>I've achieved mastery in both Git and Mercurial. I know their internals
and their command line interfaces extremely well. I understand the
architecture and principles upon which both are built. I'm also exposed
to some very experienced and knowledgeable people in the Mercurial
Community. People who have been around version control for much, much
longer than me and have knowledge of random version control tools you've
probably never heard of. This knowledge and exposure allows me to make
connections and see opportunities for version control that quite frankly
most do not. </p>
<p>In this post, I'll be talking about some high-level, high-impact problems
with Git and possible solutions for them. My primary goal of this post is
to foster positive change in Git and the services around it. While I
personally prefer Mercurial, improving Git is good for everyone. Put
another way, I want my knowledge and perspective from being part of
a version control community to be put to good wherever it can.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mercurial, as I said, I'm a heavy contributor and am somewhat
influential in the Mercurial Community. I want to be clear that my opinions
in this post are my own and I'm not speaking on behalf of the Mercurial
Project or the larger Mercurial Community. I also don't intend to claim
that Mercurial is <em>holier-than-thou</em>. Mercurial has tons of user interface
failings and deficiencies. And I'll even admit to being frustrated that some
systemic failings in Mercurial have gone unaddressed for as long as they
have. But that's for another post. This post is about Git. Let's get started.</p>
<h2>The Staging Area</h2>
<p>The staging area is a feature that should not be enabled in the default
Git configuration.</p>
<p>Most people see version control as an obstacle standing in the way of
accomplishing some other task. They just want to save their progress
towards some goal. In other words, they want version control to be a
<em>save file</em> feature in their workflow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern version control tools don't work that way. For
starters, they require people to specify a <em>commit message</em> every time
they save. This in of itself can be annoying. But we generally accept
that as the price you pay for version control: that <em>commit message</em> has
value to others (or even your future self). So you must record it.</p>
<p>Most people want the barrier to saving changes to be effortless. A commit
message is already too annoying for many users! The Git staging area
establishes a <em>higher</em> barrier to saving. Instead of just saving your
changes, you must first <em>stage</em> your changes to be saved.</p>
<p>If you requested <em>save</em> in your favorite GUI application, text editor,
etc and it popped open a <em>select the changes you would like to
save dialog</em>, you would rightly think <em>just save all my changes already,
dammit.</em> But this is exactly what Git does with its staging area! Git
is saying <em>I know all the changes you made: now tell me which changes
you'd like to save.</em> To the average user, this is infuriating because
it works in contrast to how the <em>save</em> feature works in almost every
other application.</p>
<p>There is a counterargument to be made here. You could say that the
editor/application/etc is complex - that it has multiple <em>contexts</em>
(files) - that each context is independent - and that the user should
have full control over which contexts (files) - and even changes within
those contexts - to save. I agree: this is a compelling feature. However,
it isn't an appropriate <em>default</em> feature. The ability to pick which
changes to save is a power-user feature. Most users just want to save all
the changes all the time. So that should be the default behavior. And
the Git staging area should be an opt-in feature.</p>
<p>If intrinsic workflow warts aren't enough, the Git staging area has a
horrible user interface. It is often referred to as the <em>cache</em>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6716355/why-staging-directory-is-also-called-index-git-index/6718135#6718135">for historical reasons</a>.
<em>Cache</em> of course means something to anyone who knows anything about
computers or programming. And Git's use of <em>cache</em> doesn't at all align
with that common definition. Yet the the terminology in Git persists.
You have to run commands like <code>git diff --cached</code> to examine the state
of the <em>staging area</em>. Huh?!</p>
<p>But Git also refers to the <em>staging area</em> as the <em>index</em>. And this
terminology also appears in Git commands! <code>git help commit</code> has numerous
references to the <em>index</em>. Let's see what <code>git help glossary</code> has to say::</p>
<pre><code>index
    A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are
    stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your working tree.
    Truth be told, it can also contain a second, and even a third
    version of a working tree, which are used when merging.

index entry
    The information regarding a particular file, stored in the index.
    An index entry can be unmerged, if a merge was started, but not
    yet finished (i.e. if the index contains multiple versions of that
    file).
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of end-user documentation, this is a train wreck. It tells the
lay user absolutely nothing about what the <em>index</em> actually is. Instead,
it casually throws out references to <em>stat information</em> (requires the user
know what the <code>stat()</code> function call and struct are) and <em>objects</em> (a Git
term for a piece of data stored by Git). It even undermines its own credibility
with that <em>truth be told</em> sentence. This definition is so bad that it
would probably improve user understanding if it were deleted!</p>
<p>Of course, <code>git help index</code> says <em>No manual entry for gitindex</em>. So
there is literally no hope for you to get a concise, understandable
definition of the <em>index</em>. Instead, it is one of those concepts that you
think you learn from interacting with it all the time. <em>Oh, when I
<code>git add</code> something it gets into this state where <code>git commit</code> will
actually save it.</em></p>
<p>And even if you know what the Git staging area/index/cached is, it can
still confound you. Do you know the interaction between uncommitted
changes in the staging area and working directory when you <code>git rebase</code>?
What about <code>git checkout</code>? What about the various <code>git reset</code> invocations?
I have a confession: I can't remember all the edge cases either. To play
it safe, I try to make sure all my outstanding changes are committed
before I run something like <code>git rebase</code> because I <em>know</em> that will be
safe.</p>
<p>The Git staging area doesn't have to be this complicated. A <em>re-branding</em>
away from <em>index</em> to <em>staging area</em> would go a long way. Adding an alias
from <code>git diff --staged</code> to <code>git diff --cached</code> and removing references
to the <em>cache</em> from common user commands would make a lot of sense and
reduce end-user confusion.</p>
<p>Of course, the Git staging area doesn't really need to exist at all!
The staging area is essentially a <em>soft commit</em>. It performs the
<em>save progress</em> role - the basic requirement of a version control tool.
And in some aspects it is actually a better <em>save progress</em> implementation
than a <em>commit</em> because it doesn't require you to type a commit message!
Because the <em>staging area</em> is a soft commit, all workflows using it can
be modeled as if it were a real commit and the <em>staging area</em> didn't
exist at all! For example, instead of <code>git add --interactive</code> +
<code>git commit</code>, you can run <code>git commit --interactive</code>. Or if you wish
to incrementally add new changes to an in-progress commit, you can
run <code>git commit --amend</code> or <code>git commit --amend --interactive</code> or
<code>git commit --amend --all</code>. If you actually understand the various modes
of <code>git reset</code>, you can use those to <em>uncommit</em>. Of course, the user
interface to performing these actions in Git today is a bit convoluted.
But if the <em>staging area</em> didn't exist, new high-level commands like
<code>git amend</code> and <code>git uncommit</code> could certainly be invented. </p>
<p>To the average user, the <em>staging area</em> is a complicated concept. I'm
a power user. I understand its purpose and how to harness its power. Yet
when I use Mercurial (which doesn't have a <em>staging area</em>), I don't miss
the <em>staging area</em> at all. Instead, I learn that all operations involving
the <em>staging area</em> can be modeled as other fundamental primitives (like
<em>commit amend</em>) that you are likely to encounter anyway. The <em>staging
area</em> therefore constitutes an unnecessary burden and cognitive load on
users. While powerful, its complexity and incurred confusion does not
justify its existence in the default Git configuration. The <em>staging
area</em> is a power-user feature and should be opt-in by default. </p>
<h2>Branches and Remotes Management is Complex and Time-Consuming</h2>
<p>When I first used Git (coming from CVS and Subversion), I thought
branches and remotes were incredible because they enabled new workflows
that allowed you to easily track multiple lines of work across many
repositories. And ~10 years later, I still believe the workflows they
enable are important. However, having amassed a broader perspective, I
also believe their implementation is poor and this unnecessarily confuses
many users and wastes the time of <em>all</em> users.</p>
<p>My initial <em>zen moment</em> with Git - the time when Git finally clicked for me -
was when I understood Git's object model: that Git is just a
content indexed key-value store consisting of a different object types
(blobs, trees, and commits) that have a particular relationship with
each other. <em>Refs</em> are symbolic names pointing to Git commit objects. And
Git <em>branches</em> - both local and remote - are just <em>refs</em> having a
well-defined naming convention (<code>refs/heads/&lt;name&gt;</code> for local branches and
<code>refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;name&gt;</code> for remote branches). Even <em>tags</em> and
<em>notes</em> are defined via <em>refs</em>.</p>
<p><em>Refs</em> are a necessary primitive in Git because the Git storage model is
to throw all <em>objects</em> into a single, key-value namespace. Since the store
is content indexed and the key name is a cryptographic hash of the object's
content (which for all intents and purposes is random gibberish to
end-users), the Git store by itself is unable to locate objects. If all you
had was the key-value store and you wanted to <em>find all commits</em>, you would
need to walk every object in the store and read it to see if it is a commit
object. You'd then need to buffer metadata about those objects in memory so
you could reassemble them into say a DAG to facilitate looking at commit
history. This approach obviously doesn't scale. <em>Refs</em> short-circuit this
process by providing pointers to objects of importance. It may help to
think of the set of <em>refs</em> as an <em>index</em> into the Git store.  </p>
<p><em>Refs</em> also serve another role: as guards against garbage collection.
I won't go into details about loose objects and packfiles, but it's worth
noting that Git's key-value store also behaves in ways similar to
a generational garbage collector like you would find in programming languages
such as Java and Python. The important thing to know is that Git will
garbage collect (read: delete) objects that are unused. And the mechanism
it uses to determine which objects are unused is to iterate through <em>refs</em>
and walk all transitive references from that initial pointer. If there is
an object in the store that can't be traced back to a <em>ref</em>, it is
<em>unreachable</em> and can be deleted.</p>
<p><em>Reflogs</em> maintain the history of a value for a <em>ref</em>: for each <em>ref</em> they
contain a log of what <em>commit</em> it was pointing to, when that pointer
was established, who established it, etc. <em>Reflogs</em> serve two purposes:
facilitating <em>undoing</em> a previous action and holding a reference to <em>old</em>
data to prevent it from being garbage collected. The two use cases are
related: if you don't care about undo, you don't need the old reference
to prevent garbage collection.</p>
<p>This design of Git's store is actually quite sensible. It's not perfect
(nothing is). But it is a solid foundation to build a version control tool
(or even other data storage applications) on top of.</p>
<p>The title of this section has to do with sub-optimal branches and
remotes management. But I've hardly said anything about branches or remotes!
And this leads me to my main complaint about Git's branches and remotes:
that they are very thin veneer over <em>refs</em>. The properties of Git's
underlying key-value store unnecessarily bleed into user-facing concepts
(like branches and remotes) and therefore dictate sub-optimal practices.
This is what's referred to as a <em>leaky abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>I'll give some examples.</p>
<p>As I stated above, many users treat version control as a <em>save file</em>
step in their workflow. I believe that any step that interferes with users
saving their work is user hostile. This even includes writing a commit
message! I already argued that the <em>staging area</em> significantly interferes
with this critical task. Git <em>branches</em> do as well.</p>
<p>If we were designing a version control tool from scratch (or if you were
a new user to version control), you would probably think that a sane
feature/requirement would be to update to <em>any</em> revision and start making
changes. In Git speak, this would be something like
<code>git checkout b201e96f</code>, make some file changes, <code>git commit</code>. I think
that's a pretty basic workflow requirement for a version control tool.
And the workflow I suggested is pretty intuitive: choose the thing to
start working on, make some changes, then save those changes.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens when we actually do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout b201e96f
Note: checking out 'b201e96f'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

HEAD is now at b201e96f94... Merge branch 'rs/config-write-section-fix' into maint

$ echo 'my change' &gt;&gt; README.md
$ git commit -a -m 'my change'
[detached HEAD aeb0c997ff] my change
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

$ git push indygreg
fatal: You are not currently on a branch.
To push the history leading to the current (detached HEAD)
state now, use

    git push indygreg HEAD:&lt;name-of-remote-branch&gt;

$ git checkout master
Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
any of your branches:

  aeb0c997ff my change

If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt; aeb0c997ff

Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
</code></pre>
<p>I know what all these messages mean because I've mastered Git. But if
you were a newcomer (or even a seasoned user), you might be very confused.
Just so we're on the same page, here is what's happening (along with
some commentary).</p>
<p>When I run <code>git checkout b201e96f</code>, Git is trying to tell me that I'm
potentially doing something that could result in the loss of my data. A
golden rule of version control tools is <em>don't lose the user's data</em>. When
I run <code>git checkout</code>, Git should be stating the risk for data loss very
clearly. But instead, the <em>If you want to create a new branch</em> sentence is
hiding this fact by instead phrasing things around <em>retaining commits you
create</em> rather than the possible loss of data. It's up to the user
to make the connection that <em>retaining commits you create</em> actually means
<em>don't eat my data</em>. Preventing data loss is critical and Git should not
mince words here!</p>
<p>The <code>git commit</code> seems to work like normal. However, since we're in a
<em>detached HEAD</em> state (a phrase that is likely gibberish to most users),
that commit isn't referred to by any <em>ref</em>, so it can be <em>lost</em> easily.
Git <em>should</em> be telling me that I just committed something it may not
be able to find in the future. But it doesn't. Again, Git isn't being
as protective of my data as it needs to be.</p>
<p>The failure in the <code>git push</code> command is essentially telling me I need
to give things a name in order to <em>push</em>. <em>Pushing</em> is effectively <em>remote
save</em>. And I'm going to apply my reasoning about version control tools
not interfering with <em>save</em> to <em>pushing</em> as well: Git is adding an
extra barrier to <em>remote save</em> by refusing to push commits without a
<em>branch</em> attached and by doing so is being user hostile.</p>
<p>Finally, we <code>git checkout master</code> to move to another commit. Here, Git
is actually doing something halfway reasonable. It is telling me I'm
leaving commits behind, which commits those are, and the command to
use to <em>keep</em> those commits. The warning is good but not great. I think
it needs to be stronger to reflect the risk around data loss if that
suggested Git commit isn't executed. (Of course, the <em>reflog</em> for <code>HEAD</code>
will ensure that data isn't immediately deleted. But users shouldn't
need to involve <em>reflogs</em> to not lose data that wasn't rewritten.)</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that Git doesn't allow you to just <em>update
and save</em>. Because its <em>dumb</em> store requires pointers to relevant commits
(<em>refs</em>) and because that requirement isn't abstracted away or paved over
by user-friendly features in the frontend, Git is effectively requiring
end-users to define names (<em>branches</em>) for all commits. If you fail to
define a name, it gets a lot harder to find your commits, exchange them,
and Git may delete your data. While it is technically possible to not
create branches, the version control tool is essentially unusable without
them.</p>
<p>When local branches are exchanged, they appear as <em>remote branches</em> to
others. Essentially, you give each instance of the repository a name
(the <em>remote</em>). And branches/refs fetched from a named <em>remote</em> appear
as a <em>ref</em> in the <em>ref namespace</em> for that <em>remote</em>. e.g.
<em>refs/remotes/origin</em> holds <em>refs</em> for the <em>origin</em> <em>remote</em>. (Git allows
you to not have to specify the <em>refs/remotes</em> part, so you can refer
to e.g. <em>refs/remotes/origin/master</em> as <em>origin/master</em>.)</p>
<p>Again, if you were designing a version control tool from scratch or you
were a new Git user, you'd probably think <em>remote refs</em> would make
good starting points for work. For example, if you know you should be
saving new work on top of the <em>master</em> branch, you might be inclined
to begin that work by running <code>git checkout origin/master</code>. But like
our specific-commit checkout above:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout origin/master
Note: checking out 'origin/master'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

HEAD is now at 95ec6b1b33... RelNotes: the eighth batch
</code></pre>
<p>This is the same message we got for a direct checkout. But we did
supply a <em>ref</em>/<em>remote branch</em> name. What gives? Essentially, Git tries
to enforce that the <em>refs/remotes/</em> namespace is read-only and only
updated by operations that exchange data with a remote, namely <code>git fetch</code>,
<code>git pull</code>, and <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>For this to work correctly, you need to create a new <em>local branch</em>
(which initially points to the commit that <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>
points to) and then switch/activate that <em>local branch</em>.</p>
<p>I could go on talking about all the subtle nuances of how Git branches
are managed. But I won't.</p>
<p>If you've used Git, you know you need to use branches. You may or may
not recognize just how frequently you have to type a branch name into
a <code>git</code> command. I guarantee that if you are familiar with version control
tools and workflows that aren't based on having to manage <em>refs</em> to
track data, you will find Git's forced usage of <em>refs</em> and <em>branches</em>
a bit absurd. I half jokingly refer to Git as <em>Game of Refs</em>. I say that
because coming from Mercurial (which doesn't require you to name things),
Git workflows feel to me like all I'm doing is typing the names of branches
and <em>refs</em> into <code>git</code> commands. I feel like I'm wasting my precious
time telling Git the names of things only because this is necessary to
placate the leaky abstraction of Git's storage layer which requires
references to relevant commits.</p>
<p>Git and version control doesn't have to be this way.</p>
<p>As I said, my Mercurial workflow doesn't rely on naming things. Unlike
Git, Mercurial's store has an explicit (not shared) storage location
for commits (<em>changesets</em> in Mercurial parlance). And this data structure
is ordered, meaning a changeset <em>later</em>  always occurs after its
parent/predecessor. This means that Mercurial can open a single
file/index to quickly find all <em>changesets</em>. Because Mercurial doesn't
need pointers to commits of relevance, names aren't required.</p>
<p>My <em>Zen of Mercurial</em> moment came when I realized you didn't have
to name things in Mercurial. Having used Git before Mercurial, I
was conditioned to always be naming things. This is the Git way
after all. And, truth be told, it is common to name things in Mercurial
as well. Mercurial's <em>named branches</em> were the way to do <em>feature
branches</em> in Mercurial for years. Some used the <em>MQ</em> extension (essentially
a port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilt_(software)">quilt</a>), which
also requires naming individual patches. Git users coming to Mercurial
were missing Git branches and Mercurial's <em>bookmarks</em> were a poor
<em>port</em> of Git branches.</p>
<p>But recently, more and more Mercurial users have been coming to the
realization that names aren't really necessary. If the tool doesn't
actually require naming things, why force users to name things? As long
as users can find the commits they need to find, do you actually need
names?</p>
<p>As a demonstration, my Mercurial workflow leans heavily on the <code>hg show work</code>
and <code>hg show stack</code> commands. You will need to enable the <em>show</em> extension
by putting the following in your hgrc config file to use them:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
show =
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>hg show work</code> (I have also set the config
<code>commands.show.aliasprefix=s</code>to enable me to type <code>hg swork</code>) finds all
in-progress changesets and other likely-relevant changesets (those
with names and DAG heads). It prints a concise DAG of those changesets:</p>
<p><img alt="hg show work output" src="/images/hg-show-work.png" /></p>
<p>And <code>hg show stack</code> shows just the current line of work and its
relationship to other important heads:</p>
<p><img alt="hg show stack output" src="/images/hg-show-stack.png" /></p>
<p>Aside from the <code>@</code> bookmark/name set on that top-most changeset, there are
no names! (That <code>@</code> comes from the remote repository, which has set that name.)</p>
<p>Outside of code archeology workflows, <code>hg show work</code> shows the changesets I
care about 95% of the time. With all I care about (my in-progress work and
possible rebase targets) rendered concisely, I don't have to name things
because I can just find whatever I'm looking for by running <code>hg show work</code>!
Yes, you need to run <code>hg show work</code>, visually scan for what you are looking
for, and copy a (random) hash fragment into a number of commands. This
sounds like a lot of work. But I believe it is far less work than naming
things. Only when you practice this workflow do you realize just how much
time you actually spend finding and then typing names in to <code>hg</code> and -
especailly - <code>git</code> commands! The ability to just <code>hg update</code> to a changeset
and commit without having to name things is just so liberating. It feels
like my version control tool is putting up fewer barriers and letting me
work quickly.</p>
<p>Another benefit of <code>hg show work</code> and <code>hg show stack</code> are that they present
a concise DAG visualization to users. This helps educate users about the
underlying <em>shape</em> of repository data. When you see connected nodes on a
graph and how they change over time, it makes it a lot easier to understand
concepts like <em>merge</em> and <em>rebase</em>. </p>
<p>This <em>nameless</em> workflow may sound radical. But that's because we're all
conditioned to naming things. I initially thought it was crazy as well. But
once you have a mechanism that gives you rapid access to data you care
about (<code>hg show work</code> in Mercurial's case), names become very optional. Now,
a pure <em>nameless</em> workflow isn't without its limitations. You want names
to identify the main <em>targets</em> for work (e.g. the <em>master</em> branch). And when
you exchange work with others, names are easier to work with, especially
since names survive rewriting. But in my experience, most of my commits
are only exchanged with me (synchronizing my in-progress commits across
devices) and with code review tools (which don't really need names and
can operate against raw commits). My most frequent use of names comes
when I'm in <em>repository maintainer mode</em> and I need to ensure commits
have names for others to reference.</p>
<p>Could Git support <em>nameless</em> workflows? In theory it can.</p>
<p>Git needs <em>refs</em> to find relevant commits in its store. And the wire
protocol uses <em>refs</em> to exchange data. So <em>refs</em> have to exist for Git
to function (assuming Git doesn't radically change its storage and
exchange mechanisms to mitigate the need for <em>refs</em>, but that would be
a massive change and I don't see this happening).</p>
<p>While there is a fundamental requirement for <em>refs</em> to exist, this
doesn't necessarily mean that user-facing names must exist. The reason
that we need <em>branches</em> today is because <em>branches</em> are little more than
a <em>ref</em> with special behavior. It is theoretically possible to invent a
mechanism that transparently maps <em>nameless</em> commits onto <em>refs</em>. For
example, you could create a <em>refs/nameless/</em> namespace that was
automatically populated with DAG heads that didn't have names attached.
And Git could exchange these <em>refs</em> just like it can <em>branches</em> today.
It would be a lot of work to think through all the implications and to
design and implement support for <em>nameless</em> development in Git. But I
think it is possible.</p>
<p>I encourage the Git community to investigate supporting <em>nameless</em> workflows.
Having adopted this workflow in Mercurial, Git's workflow around naming
branches feels heavyweight and restrictive to me. Put another way, <em>nameless</em>
commits are actually lighter-weight branches than Git branches! To the
common user who just wants version control to be a <em>save</em> feature,
requiring names establishes a barrier towards that goal. So removing the
naming requirement would make Git simpler and more approachable to new
users.</p>
<h2>Forks aren't the Model You are Looking For</h2>
<p>This section is more about hosted Git services (like GitHub, Bitbucket, and
GitLab) than Git itself. But since hosted Git services are synonymous
with <em>Git</em> and interaction with a hosted Git services is a regular
part of a common Git user's workflow, I feel like I need to cover it.
(For what it's worth, my experience at Mozilla tells me that a large
percentage of people who say <em>I prefer Git</em> or <em>we should use Git</em>
actually mean <em>I like GitHub</em>. Git and GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab are
effectively the same thing in the minds of many and anyone finding
themselves discussing version control needs to keep this in mind because
<em>Git</em> is more than just the command line tool: it is an ecosystem.)</p>
<p>I'll come right out and say it: I think <em>forks</em> are a relatively poor
model for collaborating. They are light years better than what
existed before. But they are still so far from the turn-key experience
that should be possible. The <em>fork</em> hasn't really changed much since
the current implementation of it was made popular by GitHub many years
ago. And I view this as a general failure of hosted services to
innovate.</p>
<p>So we have a shared understanding, a <em>fork</em> (as implemented on GitHub,
Bitbucket, GitLab, etc) is essentially a complete copy of a repository
(a <code>git clone</code> if using Git) and a fresh workspace for additional
value-added services the hosting provider offers (pull requests, issues,
wikis, project tracking, release tracking, etc). If you open the main
web page for a <em>fork</em> on these services, it looks just like the main
project's. You know it is a fork because there are cosmetics somewhere
(typically next to the project/repository name) saying <em>forked from</em>.</p>
<p>Before service providers adopted the <em>fork</em> terminology, <em>fork</em> was
used in open source to refer to a splintering of a project. If
someone or a group of people didn't like the direction a project was
taking, wanted to take over ownership of a project because of
stagnation, etc, they would <em>fork it</em>. The <em>fork</em> was based on the
original (and there may even be active collaboration between the
fork and original), but the intent of the <em>fork</em> was to create
distance between the original project and its new incantation. A
new entity that was sufficiently independent of the original.</p>
<p><em>Forks</em> on service providers mostly retain this <em>old school</em> <em>fork</em>
model. The <em>fork</em> gets a new copy of issues, wikis, etc. And anyone
who <em>forks</em> establishes what looks like an independent incantation
of a project. It's worth noting that the execution varies by service
provider. For example, GitHub won't enable <em>Issues</em> for a fork by
default, thereby encouraging people to file issues against the
<em>upstream</em> project it was forked from. (This is good default behavior.)</p>
<p>And I know why service providers (initially) implemented things this
way: it was easy. If you are building a product, it's simpler to just
say <em>a user's version of this project is a <code>git clone</code> and they get
a fresh database</em>. On a technical level, this meets the traditional
definition of <em>fork</em>. And rather than introduce a new term into the
vernacular, they just re-purposed <em>fork</em> (albeit with <em>softer</em>
connotations, since the traditional <em>fork</em> commonly implied there
was some form of strife precipitating a <em>fork</em>).</p>
<p>To help differentiate flavors of <em>forks</em>, I'm going to define the
terms <em>soft fork</em> and <em>hard fork</em>. A <em>soft fork</em> is a <em>fork</em> that
exists for purposes of collaboration. The differentiating feature
between a <em>soft fork</em> and <em>hard fork</em> is whether the <em>fork</em> is
intended to be used as its own project. If it is, it is a
<em>hard fork</em>. If not - if all changes are intended to be <em>merged</em>
into the <em>upstream</em> project and be consumed from there - it is a
<em>soft fork</em>.</p>
<p>I don't have concrete numbers, but I'm willing to wager that the vast
majority of <em>forks</em> on Git service providers which have changes are
<em>soft forks</em> rather than <em>hard forks</em>. In other words, these <em>forks</em>
exist purely as a conduit to collaborate with the canonical/upstream
project (or to facilitate a short-lived one-off change).</p>
<p>The current implementation of <em>fork</em> - which borrows a lot from its
predecessor of the same name - is a good - but not great - way to
facilitate collaboration. It isn't great because it technically
resembles what you'd expect to see for <em>hard fork</em> use cases even
though it is used predominantly with <em>soft forks</em>. This mismatch
creates problems.</p>
<p>If you were to take a step back and invent your own version control
hosted service and weren't tainted by exposure to existing services
and were willing to think a bit beyond making it a glorified frontend
for the <code>git</code> command line interface, you might realize that the problem
you are solving - the product you are selling - is collaboration as
a service, not a Git hosting service. And if your product is
collaboration, then implementing your collaboration model around the
<em>hard fork</em> model with strong barriers between the original project and
its <em>forks</em> is counterproductive and undermines your own product.
But this is how GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and others have implemented
their product!</p>
<p>To improve collaboration on version control hosted services, the concept
of a <em>fork</em> needs to significantly curtailed. Replacing it should be
a UI and workflow that revolves around the central, canonical repository.</p>
<p>You shouldn't need to create your own <em>clone</em> or <em>fork</em> of a repository
in order to contribute. Instead, you should be able to clone the
canonical repository. When you create commits, those commits should
be stored and/or more tightly affiliated with the original project - not
inside a <em>fork</em>.</p>
<p>One potential implementation is doable today. I'm going to call it
<em>workspaces</em>. Here's how it would work.</p>
<p>There would exist a namespace for <em>refs</em> that can be controlled by
the user. For example, on GitHub (where my username is <em>indygreg</em>),
if I wanted to contribute to some random project, I would <code>git push</code>
my refs somewhere under <code>refs/users/indygreg/</code> directly to that
project's. No <em>forking</em> necessary. If I wanted to contribute to a
project, I would just clone its repo then push to my <em>workspace</em> under
it. You could do this today by configuring your Git <em>refspec</em> properly.
For pushes, it would look something like
<code>refs/heads/*:refs/users/indygreg/*</code> (that tells Git to map local <em>refs</em>
under <code>refs/heads/</code> to <code>refs/users/indygreg/</code> on that <em>remote</em> repository).
If this became a popular feature, presumably the Git wire protocol could
be taught to advertise this feature such that Git clients automatically
configured themselves to push to user-specific <em>workspaces</em> attached to
the original repository.</p>
<p>There are several advantages to such a <em>workspace</em> model. Many of them
revolve around eliminating <em>forks</em>.</p>
<p>At initial contribution time, no server-side <em>fork</em> is necessary in order
to contribute. You would be able to <em>clone and contribute</em> without waiting
for or configuring a <em>fork</em>. Or if you can create commits from the web
interface, the clone wouldn't even be necessary! Lowering the barrier to
contribution is a good thing, especially if collaboration is the product
you are selling.</p>
<p>In the web UI, <em>workspaces</em> would also revolve around the source project
and not be off in their own world like <em>forks</em> are today. People could
more easily see what others are up to. And fetching their work would
require typing in their username as opposed to configuring a whole new
remote. This would bring communities closer and hopefully lead to better
collaboration.</p>
<p>Not requiring <em>forks</em> also eliminates the need to synchronize your <em>fork</em>
with the upstream repository. I don't know about you, but one of the things
that bothers me about the <em>Game of Refs</em> that Git imposes is that I have
to keep my <em>refs</em> in sync with the upstream <em>refs</em>. When I fetch from
<em>origin</em> and pull down a new <em>master</em> branch, I need to <code>git merge</code>
that branch into my local <em>master</em> branch. Then I need to push that new
<em>master</em> branch to my fork. This is quite tedious. And it is easy to merge
the wrong branches and get your <em>branch</em> state out of whack. There are
better ways to map remote <em>refs</em> into your local names to make this far
less confusing.</p>
<p>Another win here is not having to push and store data multiple times.
When working on a <em>fork</em> (which is a separate repository), after you
<code>git fetch</code> changes from upstream, you need to eventually <code>git push</code> those
into your <em>fork</em>. If you've ever worked on a large repository and didn't
have a super fast Internet connection, you may have been stymied by
having to <code>git push</code> large amounts of data to your <em>fork</em>. This is quite
annoying, especially for people with slow Internet connections. Wouldn't
it be nice if that <code>git push</code> only pushed the data that was truly new and
didn't already exist somewhere else on the server? A <em>workspace</em> model
where development all occurs in the original repository would fix this.
As a bonus, it would make the storage problem on servers easier because
you would eliminate thousands of forks and you probably wouldn't have to
care as much about data duplication across repos/clones because the
version control tool solves a lot of this problem for you, courtesy of
having all data live alongside or in the original repository instead of
in a <em>fork</em>.</p>
<p>Another win from <em>workspace</em>-centric development would be the potential to
do more user-friendly things after <em>pull/merge requests</em> are incorporated
in the official project. For example, the <em>ref</em> in your workspace could
be deleted automatically. This would ease the burden on users to clean up
after their submissions are accepted. Again, instead of mashing keys to
play the <em>Game of Refs</em>, this would all be taken care of for you
automatically. (Yes, I know there are scripts and shell aliases to
make this more turn-key. But user-friendly behavior shouldn't have to
be opt-in: it should be the default.)</p>
<p>But <em>workspaces</em> aren't all rainbows and unicorns. There are access
control concerns. You probably don't want users able to mutate the
<em>workspaces</em> of other users. Or do you? You can make a compelling
case that project <em>administrators</em> should have that ability. And what if
someone pushes bad or illegal content to a workspace and you receive
a cease and desist? Can you take down just the offending workspace while
complying with the order? And what happens if the original project is
deleted? Do all its workspaces die with it? These are not trivial
concerns. But they don't feel impossible to tackle either.</p>
<p><em>Workspaces</em> are only one potential alternative to <em>forks</em>. And I can
come up with multiple implementations of the <em>workspace</em> concept. Although
many of them are constrained by current features in the Git wire protocol.
But Git is (finally) getting a more extensible wire protocol, so hopefully
this will enable <em>nice things</em>.</p>
<p>I challenge Git service providers like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab to
think outside the box and implement something better than how <em>forks</em>
are implemented today. It will be a large shift. But I think users will
appreciate it in the long run.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Git is an ubiquitous version control tool. But it is
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/">frequently lampooned</a> for
its <a href="https://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/">poor usability</a>
and <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">documentation</a>.
We even have
<a href="https://spderosso.github.io/onward13.pdf">research</a>
<a href="https://spderosso.github.io/oopsla16.pdf">papers</a> telling us which parts
are bad. Nobody I know has had a pleasant initial experience with Git.
And it is clear that few people actually understand Git: most just know
the command incantations they need to know to accomplish a small set of
common activities. (If you are such a person, there is nothing to be
ashamed about: Git is a <em>hard</em> tool.)</p>
<p>Popular Git-based hosting and collaboration services (such as GitHub,
Bitbucket, and GitLab) exist. While they've made strides to make it
easier to commit data to a Git repository (I purposefully avoid saying
<em>use Git</em> because the most usable tools seem to avoid the <code>git</code> command
line interface as much as possible), they are often a thin veneer over
Git itself (see <em>forks</em>). And Git is a thin veneer over a content
indexed key-value store (see forced usage of bookmarks).</p>
<p>As an industry, we should be concerned about the lousy usability of Git
and the tools and services that surround it. Some may say that Git -
with its near monopoly over version control mindset - is a success. I
have a different view: I think it is a failure that a tool with a user
experience this bad has achieved the success it has.</p>
<p>The cost to Git's poor usability can be measured in tens if not hundreds
of millions of dollars in time people have wasted because they couldn't
figure out how to use Git. Git should be viewed as a source of
embarrassment, not a success story.</p>
<p>What's really concerning is that the usability problems of Git have been
known for years. Yet it is as popular as ever and there have been few
substantial usability improvements. We do have some
<a href="http://gitless.com/">alternative frontends</a> floating around. But these
haven't caught on.</p>
<p>I'm at a loss to understand how an open source tool as popular as Git
has remained so mediocre for so long. The source code is out there.
Anybody can submit a patch to fix it. Why is it that so many people get
tripped up by the same poor usability issues years after Git became
the common version control tool? It certainly appears that as an
industry we have been unable or unwilling to address systemic deficiencies
in a critical tool. Why this is, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Despite my pessimism about Git's usability and its poor track record of
being attentive to the needs of people who aren't power users, I'm
optimistic that the future will be brighter. While the ~7000 words in this
post pale in comparison to the aggregate word count that has been
written about Git, hopefully this post strikes a nerve and causes
positive change. Just because one generation has toiled with the
usability problems of Git doesn't mean the next generation has to
suffer through the same. Git can be improved and I encourage that change
to happen. The three issues above and their possible solutions would
be a good place to start.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="http://git-merge.com/">Git Merge 2015</a> was a Git user conference held
in Paris on April 8 and 9, 2015.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a version control geek. I'm also responsible for a large
part of Mozilla's version control hosting. So, when the videos were
made public, you can bet I took interest.</p>
<p>This post contains my notes from a few of the Git Merge talks. I try
to separate content/facts from my opinions by isolating my opinions
(within parenthesis).</p>
<h2>Git at Google</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/git-at-google-dave-borowitz.html">Git at Google: Making Big Projects (and everyone else) Happy</a>
is from a Googler (Dave Borowitz) who works on JGit for the Git
infrastructure team at Google.</p>
<p>"Everybody in this room is going to feel some kind of pain working with
Git at scale at some time in their career."</p>
<p>First Git usage at Google in 2008 for Android. 2011 googlesource.com
launches.</p>
<p>24,000 total Git repos at Google. 77.1M requests/day. 30-40 TB/day. 2-3
Gbps.</p>
<p>Largest repo is 210GB (not public it appears).</p>
<p>800 repos in AOSP. Google maintains internal fork of all Android repos
(so they can throw stuff over the wall). Fresh AOSP tree is 17 GiB. Lots
of contracts dictating access.</p>
<p>Chrome repos include Chromium, Blink, Chromium OS. Performed giant
Subversion migration. Developers of Chrome very set in their ways. Had
many workflows integrated with Subversion web interface. Subversion
blame was fast, Git blame slow. Built caching backend for Git blame to
make developers happy.</p>
<p>Chromium 2.9 GiB, 3.6M objects, 390k commits. Blink 5.3 GiB, 3.1M
objects, 177k commits. They merged them into a monorepo. Mention of
Facebook's monorepo talk and Mercurial scaling efforts for a repo larger
then Chromium/Blink monorepo. Benefits to developers for doing atomic
refactorings, etc.</p>
<p>"Being big is hard."</p>
<p>AOSP: 1 Gbps -&gt; 2 minutes for 17 GiB. 20 Mbps -&gt; 3 hours. Flaky internet
combined with non-resumable clone results in badness. Delta resolution
can take a while. Checkout of hundreds of thousands of files can be
slow, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>"As tool developers... it's hard to tell people don't check in large
binaries, do things this way, ... when all they are trying to do is
get their job done." (I couldn't agree more: tools should ideally not
impose sub-optimal workflows.)</p>
<p>They prefer scaling pain to supporting multiple tools. (I think this
meant don't use multiple VCSs if you can just make one scale.)</p>
<p>Shallow clone beneficial. But some commands don't work. log not very
useful.</p>
<p>Narrow clones mentioned. Apparently talked about elsewhere at Git Merge
not captured on video. Non-trivial problem for Git. "We have no idea
when this is going to happen."</p>
<p>Split repos until narrow clone is available. Google wrote repo to manage
multiple repos. They view repo and multiple repos as stop-gap until
narrow clone is implemented.</p>
<p>git submodule needs some love. Git commands don't handle submodules
or multiple repos very well. They'd like to see repo features
incorporated into git submodule.</p>
<p>Transition to server operation.</p>
<p>Pre-2.0, counting objects was hard. For Linux kernel, 60s 100% CPU time
per clone to count objects. "Linux isn't even that big."</p>
<p>Traditionally Git is single homed. Load from users. Load from
automation.</p>
<p>Told anecdote about how Google's automation once recloned the repo after
a failed Git command. Accidentally made a change one day that caused a
command to persistently fail. DoS against server. (We've had this at
Mozilla.)</p>
<p>Garbage collection on server is CPU intensive and necessary. Takes cores
away from clients.</p>
<p>Reachability bitmaps implemented in JGit, ported to Git 2.0. Counting
objects for Linux clones went from 60s CPU to ~100ms.</p>
<p>Google puts static, pre-generated bundles on a CDN. Client downloads
bundle then does incremental fetch. Massive reduction in server load.
Bundle files better for users. Resumable.</p>
<p>They have ideas for integrating bundles into git fetch, but it's
"a little way's off." (This feature is partially implemented in
Mercurial 3.4 and we have plans for using it at Mozilla.) It's feature
in repo today.</p>
<p>Shared filesystem would be really nice to spread CPU load. NFS "works."
Performance problems with high throughput repositories.</p>
<p>Master-mirror replication can help. Problems with replication lag.
Consistency is hard.</p>
<p>Google uses a distributed Git store using Bigtable and GFS built on
JGit. Git-aware load balancer. Completely separate pool of garbage
collection workers. They do replication to multiple datacenters before
pushes. 6 datacenters across world. Some of their stuff is open source.
A lot isn't.</p>
<p>Humans have difficulty managing hundreds of repositories. "How do you as
a human know what you need to modify?" Monorepos have this problem too.
Inherent with lots of content. (Seemed to imply it is worse with
multiple repos than with a monorepo.)</p>
<p>Porting changes between forks is hard. e.g. cherry picking between
internal and external Android repos.</p>
<p>ACLs are a mess.</p>
<p>Google built Gerrit code review. It does ACLs, auto rebasing, release
branch management. It's a swiss army knife. (This aligns with my
vision for MozReview and code-centric development.)</p>
<h2>Scaling Git at Twitter</h2>
<p>Wilhelm Bierbaum from Twitter talks about
<a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/scaling-git-at-twitter-wilhelm-bierbaum.html">Scaling Git at Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"We've decided it's really important to make Twitter a good place to work for
developers. Source control is one of those points where we were
lacking. We had some performance problems with Git in the past."</p>
<p>Twitter runs a monorepo. Used to be 3 repos. "Working with a single
repository is the way they prefer to develop software when developing
hundreds of services." They also have a single build system. They have
a geo diverse workforce.</p>
<p>They use normal canonical implementation of Git + some optimizations.</p>
<p>Benefits of a monorepo:</p>
<p>Visibility. Easier for people to find code in one repo. Code search tools
tailored towards single repos.</p>
<p>Single toolchain. single set of tools to build, test, and deploy. When
improvements to tools made, everyone benefits because one toolchain.</p>
<p>Easy to share code (particularly generated code like IDL). When operating
many small services, services developed together. Code duplication is
minimized. Twitter relies on IDL heavily.</p>
<p>Simpler to predict the impact of your changes. Easier to look at single
code base then to understand how multiple code bases interact. Easy to
make a change and see what breaks rather than submit changes to N repos
and do testing in N repos.</p>
<p>Makes refactoring less arduous.</p>
<p>Surfaces architecture issues earlier.</p>
<p>Breaking changes easier to coordinate</p>
<p>Drawbacks of monorepos:</p>
<p>Large disk footprint for full history.</p>
<p>Tuning filesystem only goes so far.</p>
<p>Forces some organizations to adopt sparse checkouts and shallow clones.</p>
<p>Submodules aren't good enough to use. <em>add</em> and <em>commit</em> don't recognize
submodule boundaries very well and aren't very usable.</p>
<p>"To us, using a tool such as repo that is in effect a secondary version
control tool on top of Git does not feel right and doesn't lead to a
fluid experience."</p>
<p>Twitter has centralized use of Git. Don't really benefit from
distributed version control system. Feature branches. Goal is to live as
close to master as possible. Long-running branches discouraged. Fewer
conflicts to resolve.</p>
<p>They have project-level ownership system. But any developer can change
anything.</p>
<p>They have lots of read-only replicas. Highly available writable server.</p>
<p>They use reference repos heavily so object exchange overhead is
manageable.</p>
<p>Scaling issues with many refs. Partially due to how refs are stored on
disk. File locking limits in OS. Commands like status, add, and commit
can be slow, even with repo garbage collected and packed. Locking issues
with garbage collection.</p>
<p>Incorporated file alteration monitor to make status faster. Reference to
Facebook's work on watchman and its Mercurial integration. Significant
impact on OS X. "Pretty much all our developers use OS X." (I assume
they are using Watchman with Git - I've seen patches for this on the Git
mailing list but they haven't been merged into core yet.)</p>
<p>They implemented a custom index format. Adopted faster hashing
algorithm that uses native instructions.</p>
<p>Discovery with many refs didn't scale. 13 MB of raw data for refs
exchange at Twitter. (!!) Experimenting with clients sending a bloom
filter of refs. Hacked it together via HTTP header.</p>
<p>Fetch protocol is expensive. Lots of random I/O. Can take minutes
to do incremental fetches. Bitmap indices help, but aren't good enough
for them. Since they have central and well-defined environment, they
changed fetch protocol to work like a journal: send all changed data since
client's last fetch. Server work is essentially a sendfile system call.
git push appends push packs to a log-structured journal. On fetch,
clients "replay" the transactions from the journal. Similar to MySQL
binary log replication. (This is very similar to some of the Mercurial
replication work I'm doing at Mozilla. Yay technical validation.)
(Append only files are also how Mercurial's storage model works by
default.)</p>
<p>Log-structured data exchange means server side is cheap. They can insert
HTTP caches to handle Range header aware requests.</p>
<p>Without this hack, they can't scale their servers.</p>
<p>Initial clone is seeded by BitTorrent.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone's unmerged feature branches are on the one
central repo and get transferred everywhere by default. Their journal
fetch can selectively fetch refs so this isn't a huge problem.</p>
<p>They'd like to experiment with sparse repos. But they haven't gotten to
that yet. They'd like a better storage abstraction in Git to enable
necessary future scalability. They want a network-aware storage backend.
Local objects not necessary if the network has them.</p>
<p>They are running a custom Git distribution/fork on clients. But they
don't want to maintain forever. Prefer to send upstream.</p>

  <p>The ascendancy of GitHub has very little to do with its namesake tool,
Git.</p>
<p>What GitHub did that was so radical for its time and the strategy that
GitHub continues to execute so well on today is the approach of
putting <em>code first</em> and enabling change to be a frictionless process.</p>
<p>In case you weren't around for the pre-GitHub days or don't remember,
they were not pleasant. Tools around code management were a far cry
from where they are today (I still argue the tools are pretty bad, but
that's for another post). Centralized version control systems were
prevalent (CVS and Subversion in open source, Perforce, ClearCase,
Team Foundation Server, and others in the corporate world). Tools for
looking at and querying code had horrible, ugly interfaces and came out
of a previous era of web design and browser capabilities. It felt like
a chore to do anything, including committing code. Yes, the world
had awesome services like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>,
but they weren't the same as GitHub is today.</p>
<p>Before I get to my central thesis, I want to highlight some supporting
reasons for GitHub's success. There were two developments in the second
half of the 2000s the contributed to the success of GitHub: the rises
of the distributed version control system (DVCS) and the modern web.</p>
<p>While distributed version control systems like Sun WorkShop TeamWare and
BitKeeper existed earlier, it wasn't until the second half of the 2000s
that DVCS systems took off. You can argue part of the reason for this
was open source: my recollection is there wasn't a well-known DVCS
available as free software before 2005. Speaking of 2005, it was a big
year for DVCS projects: Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar all had initial
releases. Suddenly, there were old-but-new ideas on how to do source
control being exposed to new and willing-to-experiment audiences. DVCS
were a critical leap from traditional version control because they
(theoretically) impose less process and workflow limitations on users.
With traditional version control, you needed to be online to commit,
meaning you were managing patches, not commits, in your local
development workflow. There were some forms of branching and merging,
but they were a far cry from what is available today and were often too
complex for mere mortals to use. As more and more people were exposed to
<em>distributed</em> version control, they welcomed its less-restrictive and
more powerful workflows. They realized that source control tools don't
have to be so limiting. <em>Distributed</em> version control also promised all
kinds of revamped workflows that could be harnessed. There were
potential wins all around.</p>
<p>Around the same time that open source DVCS systems were emerging, web
browsers were evolving from an application to render static pages to a
platform for running web <em>applications</em>. Web sites using JavaScript
to dynamically manipulate web page content (DHTML as it was known back
then) were starting to hit their stride. I believe it was GMail that
turned the most heads as to the full power of the <em>modern web</em>
experience, with its novel-for-its-time extreme reliance on
XMLHttpRequest for dynamically changing page content. People were
realizing that powerful, desktop-like applications could be built for
the web and could run everywhere.</p>
<p>GitHub launched in April 2008 standing on the shoulders of both the
emerging interest in the Git content tracking tool and the capabilities
of modern browsers.</p>
<p>I wasn't an early user of GitHub. My recollection is that GitHub was
mostly a Rubyist's playground back then. I wasn't a Ruby programmer, so
I had little reason to use GitHub in the early stages. But people did
start using GitHub. And in the spirit of Ruby (on Rails), GitHub moved
fast, or at least was projecting the notion that they were. While other
services built on top of DVCS tools - like Bitbucket - did exist back then,
GitHub seemed to have momentum associated with it. (Look at the archives
for <a href="https://github.com/blog">GitHub's</a> and
<a href="https://blog.bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket's</a> respective blogs. GitHub has
hundreds of blog entries; Bitbucket numbers in the dozens.) Developers
everywhere up until this point had all been dealing with sub-optimal tools
and workflows. Some of us realized it. Others hadn't. Many of those who
did saw GitHub as a beacon of hope: we have all these new ideas and new
potentials with distributed version control and here is a service under
active development trying to figure out how to exploit that. Oh, and
it's free for open source. Sign me up!</p>
<p>GitHub did capitalize on a market opportunity. They also capitalized on
the value of marketing and the perception that they were moving fast and
providing features that people - especially in open source - wanted.
This captured the early adopters market. But I think what really set
GitHub apart and led to the success they are enjoying today is their
<em>code first</em> approach and their desire to make contribution easy, and
even fun and sociable.</p>
<p>As developers, our job is to solve problems. We often do that by writing
and changing code. And this often involves working as part of a team, or
collaborating. To collaborate, we need tools. You eventually need some
processes. And as I
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">recently blogged</a>,
this can lead to <em>process debt</em> and inefficiencies associated with them.</p>
<p>Before GitHub, the <em>process debt</em> for contributing to other projects was
high. You often had to subscribe to mailing lists in order to submit
patches as emails. Or, you had to create an account on someone's bug
tracker or code review tool before you could send patches. Then you had
to figure out how to use these tools and any organization or
project-specific extensions and workflows attached to them. It was quite
involved and a lot could go wrong. Many projects and organizations (like
Mozilla) still practice this traditional methology. Furthermore (and as
I've
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written before</a>),
these traditional, single patch/commit-based tools often aren't
effective at ensuring the desired output of high quality software.</p>
<p>Before GitHub solved <em>process debt</em> via commoditization of knowledge via
market dominance, they took another approach: emphasizing <em>code first</em>
development.</p>
<p>GitHub is all about the <strong>code</strong>. You load a project page and you see
<strong>code</strong>. You may think a README with basic project information would be
the first thing on a <em>project</em> page. But it isn't. <em>Code</em>, like data,
is king.</p>
<p>Collaboration and contribution on GitHub revolve around the <em>pull
request</em>. It's a way of saying, <em>hey, I made a change, will you take
it?</em> There's nothing too novel in the concept of the <em>pull request</em>:
it's fundamentally no different than sending emails with patches to a
mailing list. But what is so special is GitHub's execution. Gone are
the days of configuring and using one-off tools and processes. Instead,
we have the friendly confines of a clean, friendly, and modern web
experience. While GitHub is built upon the Git tool, you don't even
need to use Git (a tool
<a href="http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">lampooned</a>
for its
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/">horrible usability and approachability</a>)
to contribute on GitHub! Instead, you can
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/">do everything from your browser</a>.
That warrants repeating: <strong>you don't need to leave your browser to
contribute on GitHub</strong>. GitHub has essentially reduced <em>process debt</em>
to <em>edit a text document</em> territory, and pretty much anybody who has
used a computer can do that. This has enabled GitHub to dabble into
non-code territory, such as its
<a href="https://government.github.com/">GitHub and Government</a> initiative to
foster community involvement in government. (GitHub is really a platform
for easily seeing and changing <em>any</em> content or data. But, please, let
me continue using <em>code</em> as a stand-in, since I want to focus on the
developer audience.)</p>
<p>GitHub took an overly-complicated and fragmented world of varying
contribution processes and made the new world revolve around code and a
unified and simple process for change - the <em>pull request</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, there are other reasons for GitHub's success. You can make strong
arguments that GitHub has capitalized on the social and psychological
aspects of coding and human desire for success and happiness. I agree.</p>
<p>You can also argue GitHub succeeded because of Git. That statement is
more or less technically accurate, but I don't think it is a sound
argument. Git may have been the most feature complete open source
DVCS at the time GitHub came into existence. But that doesn't mean there
is something special about Git that no other DVCS has that makes GitHub
popular. Had another tool been more feature complete or had the backing
of a project as large as Linux at the time of GitHub's launch, we could
very well be looking at a successful service built on something that
isn't Git. Git had early market advantage and I argue its popularity
today - a lot of it via GitHub - is largely a result of its early
advantages over competing tools. And, I would go so far to say that when
you consider the poor usability of Git and the pain that its users go
through when first learning it, more accurate statements would be that
<em>GitHub succeeded in spite of Git</em> and <em>Git owes much of its success to
GitHub</em>.</p>
<p>When I look back at the rise of GitHub, I see a service that has
succeeded by putting people first by allowing them to capitalize
on more productive workflows and processes. They've done this by
emphasizing <em>code</em>, not process, as the means for change. Organizations
and projects should take note.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When companies or organizations deploy version control, they have to
make many choices. One of them is how many repositories to create.
Your choices are essentially a) a single, monolithic repository that
holds everything b) many separate, smaller repositories that hold
all the individual parts c) something in between.</p>
<p>The prevailing convention today (especially in the open source
realm) is to create many separate and loosely coupled repositories,
each repository mapping to a specific product or service. That does
seem reasonable: if you were organizing files on your filesystem,
you would group them by functionality or role (photos, music,
documents, etc). And, version control tools are functionally
filesystems. So it makes sense to draw repository boundaries at
directory/role levels.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the separate repository convention is the
scaling behavior of our version control tools. Git, the popular
tool in open source these days, doesn't scale well to very large
repositories due to - among other things - not having narrow clones
(fetching a subset of files). It scales well enough to the
overwhelming majority of projects. But if you are a large
organization generating lots of data (read: gigabytes of data over
hundreds of thousands of files and commits) for version control,
Git is unsuitable in its current form. Other tools (like Mercurial)
don't currently fare that much better (although Mercurial has plans
to tackle these scaling vectors).</p>
<p>Despite popular convention and even limitations in tools, companies
like Google and Facebook opt to run large, monolithic repositories.
Google runs Perforce.
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook is on Mercurial</a>,
or at least is in the process of migrating to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Why do these companies run monolithic repositories?
In <a href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Google's words</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have a single large depot with almost all of Google's projects
on it. This aids agile development and is much loved by our users,
since it allows almost anyone to easily view almost any code, allows
projects to share code, and allows engineers to move freely from
project to project. Documentation and data is stored on the server
as well as code.</em></p>
<p>So, monolithic repositories are all about moving fast and getting things
done more efficiently. In other words, <strong>monolithic repositories
increase developer productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, monolithic repositories are also more compatible with
the ebb and flow of large organizations and large software projects.
Components, features, products, and teams come and go, merge and split.
The only constant is change. And if you are maintaining separate
repositories that attempt to map to this ever-changing organizational
topology, you are going to have a bad time. Either you'll be
constantly copying, moving, merging, splitting, etc data and repositories.
Or your repositories will be organized in a very non-logical and
non-intuitive manner. That translates to overhead and lost productivity.
I think that monolithic repositories handle the realities of large
organizations much better. Big change or reorganization you want
to reflect? You can make a single, atomic, history-preserving commit
to move things around. I think that's much more manageable, especially
when you consider the difficulty and annoyance of history-preserving
changes across repositories.</p>
<p>Naysayers will decry monolithic repositories on principled and practical
grounds.</p>
<p>The principled camp will say that separate repositories
constitute a loosely coupled (dare I say service oriented) architecture
that maps better to how software is consumed, assembled, and deployed
and that erecting barriers in the form of separate repositories
deliberately enforces this architecture. I agree. However, you can
still maintain a loosely coupled architecture with monolithic
repositories. The Subversion model of checking out a single tree
<em>from a larger repository</em> proves this. Furthermore, I would say
architecture decisions should be enforced by people (via code review,
etc), not via version control repository topology. I believe this
principled argument against monolithic repositories to be rather weak.</p>
<p>The principled camp living in the open source realm may also decry
monolithic repositories as an affront to the spirit of open source.
They would say that a monolithic repository creates unfairly strong
ties to the organization that operates it and creates barriers to
forking, etc. This may be true. But monolithic repositories don't
intrinsically infringe on the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">basic software freedoms</a>,
organizations do. Therefore, I find this principled argument rather
weak.</p>
<p>The practical camp will say that monolithic repositories just don't
scale or aren't suitable for general audiences. These concerns are
real.</p>
<p><em>Fully</em> distributed version control systems (every commit on every
machine) definitely don't scale past certain limits. Depending on your
repository and user base, your scaling limits include disk space
(repository data terabytes in size), bandwidth (repository data terabytes
in size), filesystem (repository hundreds of thousands or millions of
files), CPU and memory (operations on large repositories take too
many system resources), and many heads/branches (tools like Git and
Mercurial don't scale well to tens of thousands of heads/branches).
These limitations with fully distributed version
control are why distributed version control tools like Git and
Mercurial support a partially-distributed mode that behaves more like
your classical server-client model, like those employed by Subversion,
Perforce, etc. Git supports shallow clone and sparse checkout.
Mercurial supports shallow clone (via remotefilelog) and has planned
support for narrow clone and sparse checkout by the end of 2015.
Of course, you can avoid the scaling limitations of distributed
version control by employing a non-distributed tool, such as Subversion.
Many companies continue to reach this conclusion today. However,
users adapted to the distributed workflow would likely be
up in arms (they would probably use tools like hg-subversion or git-svn
to maintain their workflows). So, while scaling of version control
can be a real concern, there are solutions and workarounds. However,
they do involve falling back to a partially-distributed model.</p>
<p>Another concern with monolithic repositories is user access control. You
inevitably have code or data that is more sensitive and want to limit
who can change or even access it. Separate repositories seem to
facilitate a simpler model: per-repository access control. With
monolithic repositories, you have to worry about per-directory/subtree
permissions, an increased risk of data leaking, etc. This concern is
more real with distributed version control, as distributed data and
access control aren't naturally compatible. But these issues can be
resolved. And if the tooling supports it, there is only a semantic
difference between managing access control between repositories versus
components of a single repository.</p>
<p>When it comes to repository hosting conversions, I agree with Google
and Facebook: <strong>I prefer monolithic repositories</strong>. When I am interacting
with version control, I just want to get stuff done. I don't want to
waste time dealing with multiple commands to manage multiple
repositories. I don't want to waste time or expend cognitive load
dealing with submodule, subrepository, or big files management. I
don't want to waste time trying to find and reuse code, data, or
documentation. I want everything at my fingertips, where it can be
easily discovered, inspected, and used. Monolithic repositories
facilitate these workflows more than separate repositories and make
me more productive as a result.</p>
<p>Now, if only all the tools and processes we use and love would work
with monolithic repositories...</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I was editing a wiki page yesterday and I think I coined a new term
which I'd like to enter the common nomenclature: <em>repository-centric
development</em>. The term refers to development/version control
workflows that place repositories - not patches - first.</p>
<p>When collaborating on version controlled code with modern tools like
Git and Mercurial, you essentially have two choices on how to
share version control data: patches or repositories.</p>
<p>Patches have been around since the dawn of version control. Everyone
knows how they work: your version control system has a copy of
the canonical data and it can export a view of a specific change
into what's called a patch. A patch is essentially a diff with
extra metadata.</p>
<p>When distributed version control systems came along, they brought
with them an alternative to patch-centric development:
repository-centric development. You could still exchange patches if you
wanted, but distributed version control allowed you to <em>pull</em> changes
directly from multiple <em>repositories</em>. You weren't limited to a single
master server (that's what the <em>distributed</em> in <em>distributed version
control</em> means). You also didn't have to go through an intermediate
transport such as email to exchange patches: you communicate directly
with a peer repository instance.</p>
<p>Repository-centric development eliminates the <em>middle man</em> required
for patch exchange: instead of exchanging derived data, you exchange
the actual data, speaking the repository's native language.</p>
<p>One advantage of repository-centric development is it eliminates the
problem of patch non-uniformity. Patches come in many different flavors.
You have plain diffs. You have diffs with metadata. You have Git style
metadata. You have Mercurial style metadata. You can produce patches
with various lines of context in the diff. There are different methods
for handling binary content. There are different ways to express
file adds, removals, and renames. It's all a hot mess. Any system
that consumes patches needs to deal with the non-uniformity. Do you
think this isn't a problem in the real world? Think again. If you are
involved with an open source project that collects patches via email
or by uploading patches to a bug tracker, have you ever seen someone
accidentally upload a patch in the wrong format? That's patch
non-uniformity. New contributors to Firefox do this all the time. I
also see it in the Mercurial project. With repository-centric
development, patches never enter the picture, so patch non-uniformity
is a non-issue. (Don't confuse the superficial formatting of patches
with the content, such as an incorrect commit message format.)</p>
<p>Another advantage of repository-centric development is it makes the
act of exchanging data easier. Just have two repositories talk to
each other. This used to be difficult, but hosting services like
GitHub and Bitbucket make this easy. Contrast with patches, which
require hooking your version control tool up to wherever those patches
are located. The Linux Kernel, like so many other projects,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">uses email for contributing changes</a>.
So now Git, Mercurial, etc all fulfill Zawinski's law. This means your
version control tool is talking to your inbox to send and receive code.
Firefox development uses Bugzilla to hold patches as attachments. So now your
version control tool needs to talk to your issue tracker. (Not the worst
idea in the world I will concede.) While, yes, the tools around using
email or uploading patches to issue trackers or whatever else you are
using to exchange patches exist and can work pretty well, the grim
reality is that these tools are all reinventing the wheel of repository
exchange and are solving a problem that has already been solved by
<em>git push</em>, <em>git fetch</em>, <em>hg pull</em>, <em>hg push</em>, etc. Personally, I would
rather <em>hg push</em> to a remote and have tools like issue trackers and
mailing lists pull directly from repositories. At least that way they
have a direct line into the source of truth and are guaranteed a
consistent output format.</p>
<p>Another area where direct exchange is huge is multi-patch commits
(<em>branches</em> in Git parlance) or where commit data is fragmented. When
pushing patches to email, you need to insert metadata saying which patch
comes after which. Then the email import tool needs to reassemble things
in the proper order (remember that the typical convention is one email
per patch and email can be delivered out of order). Not the most
difficult problem in the world to solve. But seriously, it's been
solved already by <em>git fetch</em> and <em>hg pull</em>! Things are worse for
Bugzilla. There is no bullet-proof way to order patches there. The
convention at Mozilla is to add <em>Part N</em> strings to
commit messages and have the Bugzilla import tool do a sort (I assume it
does that). But what if you have a logical commit series spread across
multiple bugs? How do you reassemble everything into a linear series of
commits? You don't, sadly. Just today I wanted to apply a somewhat
complicated series of patches to the Firefox build system I was asked to
review so I could jump into a debugger and see what was going on so I
could conduct a more thorough review. There were 4 or 5 patches spread
over 3 or 4 bugs. Bugzilla and its patch-centric workflow prevented me
from importing the patches. Fortunately, this patch series was pushed to
Mozilla's Try server, so I could pull from there. But I haven't always
been so fortunate. This limitation means developers have to make
sacrifices such as writing fewer, larger patches (this makes code review
harder) or involving unrelated parties in the same bug and/or review.
In other words, deficient tools are imposing limited workflows. No bueno.</p>
<p>It is a fair criticism to say that not everyone can host a server or
that permissions and authorization are hard. Although I think concerns
about impact are overblown. If you are a small project, just create a
GitHub or Bitbucket account. If you are a larger project, realize that
people time is one of your largest expenses and invest in tools like
proper and efficient repository hosting (often this can be GitHub) to
reduce this waste and keep your developers happier and more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the clearest examples of repository-centric development is
GitHub. There are no patches in GitHub. Instead, you <em>git push</em>
and <em>git fetch</em>. Want to apply someone else's work? Just add a remote
and <em>git fetch</em>! Contrast with first locating patches, hooking up
Git to consume them (this part was always confusing to me - do you
need to retroactively have them sent to your email inbox so you can
import them from there), and finally actually importing them. Just
give me a URL to a repository already. But the benefits of
repository-centric development with GitHub don't stop at pushing and
pulling. GitHub has built code review functionality into pushes. They
call these <em>pull requests</em>. While I have significant issues with
GitHub's implemention of pull requests (I need to blog about those some
day), I can't deny the utility of the repository-centric workflow and
all the benefits around it. Once you switch to GitHub and its
repository-centric workflow, you more clearly see how lacking
patch-centric development is and quickly lose your desire to go back
to the 1990's state-of-the-art methods for software development.</p>
<p>I hope you now know what repository-centric development is and will join
me in championing it over patch-based development.</p>
<p>Mozillians reading this will be very happy to learn that work is under
way to shift Firefox's development workflow to a more repository-centric
world. Stay tuned.</p>
