  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The subject of where to host version control repositories comes up a lot
at Mozilla. It takes many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should move the Firefox repository to GitHub</li>
<li>I should be allowed to commit to GitHub</li>
<li>I want the canonical repository to be hosted by Bitbucket</li>
</ul>
<p>When Firefox development is concerned, Release Engineerings puts down
their foot and insists the canonical repository be hosted by Mozilla,
under a Mozilla hostname. When that's not possible, they set up a mirror
on Mozilla infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/-myjRIPcVwU/discussion">recent issue with the Jenkins project</a>
demonstrates why hosting your own version control server is important.
The gist is someone force pushed to a bunch of repos hosted on GitHub.
They needed to involve GitHub support to recover from the issue. While
it appears they largely recovered (and GitHub support deserves kudos - I
don't want to take away from their excellence), this problem would have
been avoided or the response time significantly decreased if the Jenkins
people had direct control over the Git server: they either could have
installed a custom hook that would have prevented the pushes or had
access to the reflog so they could have easily seen the last pushed
revision and easily forced pushed back to it. GitHub doesn't have a
mechanism for defining pre-* hooks, doesn't allow defining custom
hooks (a security and performance issue for them), and doesn't
expose the reflog data.</p>
<p>Until repository hosting services expose full repository data (such as
reflogs) and allow you to define custom hooks, accidents like these will
happen and the recovery time will be longer than if you hosted the repo
yourself.</p>
<p>It's possible repository hosting services like GitHub and Bitbucket will
expose these features or provide a means to quickly recover. If so,
kudos to them. But larger, more advanced projects will likely employ
custom hooks and considering custom hooks are a massive security and
performance issue for any hosted service provider, I'm not going to
hold my breath this particular feature is rolled out any time soon.
This is unfortunate, as it makes projects seemingly choose between
low risk/low convenience and GitHub's vibrant developer community.</p>

  <p><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> 2.8 has been released.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_2.8_.282013-11-1.29">changes</a>
aren't as sexy as previous releases. But there are a handful of bug
fixes that seem useful to pull in. People may also find the new <em>shelve</em>
extension useful.</p>
<p>I encourage Mozillians to keep their Mercurial up to date. I once went
around the San Francisco office and stood behind people as they
upgraded to a modern Mercurial. For the next few weeks I was hearing a
lot of "OMG Mercurial is so much better now." Don't handicap yourself by
running an older, buggy Mercurial.</p>
<p>If you don't yet feel comfortable running 2.8, 2.7 should be safe.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have updated my
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/mozext">Mercurial extension tailored for Gecko/Firefox development</a>
with features that support rich querying of Mozilla/Gecko-development
specific metadata!</p>
<p>The extension now comes with a bug full of
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/revsets">revision set</a> selectors and
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/hg/help/templates">template keywords</a>. You can
use them to query and format Mozilla-central metadata from the
repository.</p>
<h2>Revision set selectors</h2>
<p>You can now select changesets referencing a specific bug number:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'bug(931383)'
</code></pre>
<p>Or that were reviewed by a specific person:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'reviewer(gps)'
</code></pre>
<p>Or were reviewed or not reviewed:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'reviewed()'
hg log -r 'not reviewed()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can now select changesets that are present in a specific tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'tree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>I've also introduced support to query changesets <em>you</em> influenced:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'me()'
</code></pre>
<p>(This finds changesets you authored or reviewed.)</p>
<p>You can select changesets that initially landed on a specific tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'firstpushtree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets marked as <em>DONTBUILD</em>:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'dontbuild()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets that don't reference a bug:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'nobug()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can select changesets that were <em>push heads</em> for a tree:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'pushhead(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>(This would form the basis of a push-aware bisection tool - an excellent
idea for a future feature in this extension.)</p>
<p>You can combine these revset selector functions with other revset
selectors to do some pretty powerful things.</p>
<p>To select all changesets on inbound but not central:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'tree(inbound) - tree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all your contributions on beta but not release:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'me() &amp; (tree(beta) - tree(release))'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all changesets referencing a specific bug that have landed in
Aurora:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'bug(931383) and tree(aurora)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all changesets marked <em>DONTBUILD</em> that landed directly on central:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'dontbuild() and firstpushtree(central)'
</code></pre>
<p>To find all non-merge changesets that don't reference a bug:</p>
<pre><code>hg log -r 'not merge() and nobug()'
</code></pre>
<p>Neato!</p>
<h2>Template keywords</h2>
<p>You can also now print some Mozilla information when using templates.</p>
<p>To print the main bug of a changeset, use:</p>
<pre><code>{bug}
</code></pre>
<p>To retrieve all referenced bugs:</p>
<pre><code>{bugs} {join(bugs, ', ')}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the reviewers:</p>
<pre><code>{reviewer} {join(reviewers, ', ')}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the first version a changeset appeared in a specific channel:</p>
<pre><code>{firstrelease} {firstbeta} {firstaurora} {firstnightly}
</code></pre>
<p>To print the <strong>estimated</strong> first Aurora and Nightly date for a
changeset, use:</p>
<pre><code>{auroradate} {nightlydate}
</code></pre>
<p>(Getting the exact first Aurora and Nightly dates requires consulting
3rd party services, which we don't currently do. I'd like to
eventually integrate these into the extension. For now, it just
estimates dates from the pushlog data.)</p>
<p>You can also print who and where pushed a changeset:</p>
<pre><code>{firstpushuser} {firstpushtree}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also print the TBPL URL with the results of the first push:</p>
<pre><code>{firstpushtbpl}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example that prints channel versions and dates for each
changesets:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{rev} Nightly: {firstnightly} {nightlydate}; Aurora {firstaurora} {auroradate}; Beta: {firstbeta}; Release: {firstrelease}\n'
</code></pre>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Of course, you can combine selectors and templates to create some
mighty powerful queries.</p>
<p>To look at your impact on Mozilla, do something like:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{rev} Bug {bug}; Release {firstrelease}\n' -r 'me()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily forumate a status report for your activity in the past
week:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{firstline(desc)}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-7) and me()'
</code></pre>
<p>You can also query Mercurial to see where changesets have been landing
in the past 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{firstpushtree}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-30)' | sort | uniq -c
</code></pre>
<p>You can see who has been reviewing lots of patches lately:</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template '{join(reviewers, "\n")}\n' -r 'firstpushdate(-30)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>
<p>(smaug currently has the top score, edging out my 116 reviews with 137.)</p>
<p>If you want to reuse templates (instead of having to type them on the
command line), you can save them as <em>style files</em>. Search
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mercurial+style+files">the Internets</a>
to learn how to use them. You can even change your default style so
the default output from <em>hg log</em> contains everything you'd ever want to
know about a changeset!</p>
<h2>Keeping it running</h2>
<p>Many of the queries rely on data derived from multiple repositories and
pushlog data that is external to the repository.</p>
<p>To get best results, you'll need to be running a monolithic/unified
Mercurial repository. You can either assemble one locally with this
extension by periodically pulling from the separate repos:</p>
<pre><code>hg pull releases
hg pull integration
</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can pull from
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko">my personal unified repo</a>.</p>
<p>You will also need to ensure the pushlog data is current. If you pull
directly from the official repos, this will happen automatically. To be
sure, run:</p>
<pre><code>hg pushlogsync
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can force a repopulation of cached bug data by running:</p>
<pre><code>hg buginfo --reset
</code></pre>
<p>Over time, I want all this to automagically work. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Comments and future improvements</h2>
<p>I implemented this feature to save myself from having to go troving
through Bugzilla and repository history to answer questions and to
obtain metrics. I can now answer many questions via simple Mercurial
one-liners.</p>
<p>Custom revision set selectors and template keywords are a pretty nifty
feature of Mercurial. They demonstrate how you can extend Mercurial to
be aware of more than just tracking commits and files. As I've
<a href="/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercurial-%28and-git%29/">said before</a>
and will continue to say, the extensibility of Mercurial is
really its killer feature, especially for organizations with
well-defined processes (like Mozilla). The kind of extensibility I
achieved with this extension with custom queries and formatting
functions is just not possible with Git (at least not with the reference
C implementation that the overwhelming majority of Git users use).</p>
<p>There are numerous improvements that can be made to the extension.
Obviously more revision set selectors and template keywords can be
added. The parsing routine to extract bugs and reviewers isn't the most
robust in the world. I copied some existing Mozilla code. It does well
at detecting string patters but doesn't cope well with extracting lists.</p>
<p>I'd also love to better integrate Mercurial with automation
results so you can do things like expose a <em>greenpush()</em> selector and do
things like <em>hg up -r 'last(tree(inbound)) and greenpush()'</em> (which
of course could be exposed as <em>lastgreen(inbound)</em>. Wouldn't
that be cool! (This would be possible if we had better APIs for querying
individual push results.) It would also be possible to have the
Mercurial server expose this data as repository data so clients pull it
automatically. That would prevent clients from all needing to query the
same 3rd party services. Just a crazy thought.</p>
<p>Speed can be an issue. Calculating the release information
(<em>{firstnightly}</em> etc) is currently slower than I'd like. This is mostly
due to me using inefficient algorithms and not caching things where I
should. Speed issues should be fixed in due time.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you run into any problems or have suggestions for
improvements. If you want to implement your own revision set selectors
or template keywords, it's <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/hgext-gecko-dev/file/35bb3c96d786/__init__.py#l705">easier</a>
than you think! I will happily accept patches. Keep in mind that
Mercurial can integrate with 3rd party services. So if you want to
supplement repository data with data from a HTTP+JSON web service,
that's very doable. The sky is the limit.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have <a href="/blog/2013/05/13/the-state-of-mercurial-at-mozilla/">long opined</a>
about the sad state of Mercurial at Mozilla. The short version is
Mozilla has failed to use Mercurial optimally, at least for Firefox
development. It's easy to see why so many Mozillians are quick to
discredit Mercurial when compared to Git!</p>
<p>I have a <a href="/blog/category/mercurial/">history</a> attempting to address the
deficiencies. Up to this point, I've been able to make things better
through local tooling. But, for my next set of tricks, I reached an
impasse with the Mercurial server at
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>. So, I stood up my own
Mercurial server at
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com">hg.gregoryszorc.com/</a>!</p>
<p>This server is running Mercurial 2.7 and has a few nice features the
official Mercurial server at hg.mozilla.org does not.</p>
<h2>The repositories</h2>
<p><a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko">http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko</a> is
a read-only unified Mercurial repository containing the commits for the
major Firefox/Gecko repositories. If you look at its
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko/bookmarks">bookmarks</a>, you'll see
something special: the heads of all the separate Mercurial repos it is
aggregating are being stored as bookmarks! (Bookmarks are effectively
Git branches.) The tip of mozilla-central is at the bookmark
<strong>central/default</strong>. The tip of Beta is at <strong>beta/default</strong>.
You get the idea. Once you clone this repo, you can easily switch
between <em>project branches</em> by running e.g. <strong>hg up central/default</strong>.
When you pull the repo, you get changesets for all repos by connecting
to one server, not several (this reduces load on Mozilla's servers and
is faster for clients).</p>
<p>This repository shares the same changesets/SHA-1's as the official
repositories. It just has everything under one roof. You can work out of
this repository and push to the official repositories. Although, you may
want to use the <em>pushtree</em> command from my
<a href="/blog/2013/07/22/mercurial-extension-for-gecko-development/">custom extension</a>
to make your life easier (<em>hg push</em> with no arguments will attempt to
push all changesets, which you definitely don't want when pushing to
e.g. mozilla-central).</p>
<p><a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-collab">http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-collab</a>
is an offshoot of the <em>gecko</em> repo that you can push to. Changesets from
the <em>gecko</em> repo are pulled into it automatically.</p>
<p>What makes the <em>gecko-collab</em> repository special is that it has
<em>obsolescence</em> enabled. That is the core Mercurial feature enabling
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution">changeset evolution</a>.
More on that feature and why it is amazing in a future blog post. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Cloning</h2>
<p>If you would like to clone one of these unified repos, please do my
paltry EC2 server a favor and bootstrap your clone from an existing
clone. e.g. if you have a copy of mozilla-central sitting around but
don't want my repo's changesets to <em>pollute</em> it, do the following:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>hg clone mozilla-central gecko
<span class="nb">cd </span>gecko
hg pull http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko
</pre></div>

<p>Or, if you are OK with your clone accumulating the extra changesets from
all the project branches, just run:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>hg pull http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko
</pre></div>

<p>Don't forget to update the <em>[paths]</em> section in your <em>.hg/hgrc</em> file
to point to hg.gregoryszorc.com! e.g.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>[paths]
gecko = http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko
collab = http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-collab
</pre></div>

<h2>Setting up push support and SSH keys</h2>
<p>If you would like to push to the
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-collab">gecko-collab</a> repository,
you'll need to give me your SSH public key. But don't give me your key -
give an automated process your key!</p>
<p>Head on over to
<a href="http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com">http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/</a>
and log in (look for the Persona button). Once you've logged in, go to your
settings by clicking the wrench icon in the top right. Then look for
<em>SSH Public Keys</em> to add your key(s). If you can't find it, just go to
<a href="http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/settings/panel/ssh/">http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/settings/panel/ssh/</a>.</p>
<p>Once your SSH public key is added, it will take up to a minute for it to
be added to my system. It's all automatic. You don't need to wait for
any manual action.</p>
<p>To connect to my server over SSH, you'll need to log in as the <em>hgssh</em>
user. e.g. in your <em>hgrc</em> file, add:</p>
<pre><code>[paths]
gecko = ssh://hgssh@hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko
collab = ssh://hgssh@hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-collab
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you should be able to pull and push over SSH!</p>
<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<p>This server is running on an EC2 instance that isn't as powerful as I'd
like. Expect some operations to be slower than desired.</p>
<p>I don't guarantee an SLA for this service. It could go down at any
moment. However, Mercurial being a distributed version control system,
there should be little to no data loss assuming people pull frequently.
I know I have a backup on all my machines now.</p>
<p>I'm running this server for two main reasons.</p>
<p>First, I want to demonstrate the utility of a unified Mercurial server
for Firefox development in hopes we can run one officially. I've been
running a unified repo locally for a few months and I have little doubt
I'm more productive because of it. I want others to realize the
awesomeness.</p>
<p>Second, I needed a server that supported
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution">changeset evolution</a>
so I could play around with it. I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=925383">asked</a>
the powers at be to enable it on hg.mozilla.org and didn't get a
response that met my timeline. So, I figured setting up my own server
was easier.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this server.
I'd also love to hear whether people like the unified repo approach!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'm a big fan of tools that encourage and/or enforce the following of
best practices and that help people become more productive.</p>
<p>One of the tools that Firefox developers interact with nearly daily is
Mercurial. As I've observed from coworkers and from community
contributors, many don't have Mercurial configured for optimal
development. For first-time contributors, this can manifest in patch
rejection - an experience that can be embarassing and demotivating. This
is frustrating to me because most issues are easily identifiable and
correctable. And, when addressed, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pleased to announce that there is now a configuration wizard
in the Firefox source tree to help with configuring Mercurial. To run it,
just type:</p>
<pre><code>./mach mercurial-setup
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, it's aimed for first-time contributors. So, it's missing
things that more seasoned developers rely on. But you need to start
somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Currently, the tool isn't advertised anywhere other than <em>mach help</em>.
Please run it and report issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a> or
file a new report. Once things have baked in, I'd like to add some kind
of notification/tips system to mach where it will encourage you to do
things like automatically run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>. Until then, I
recommend trying to remember to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> every few
weeks to ensure your Mercurial environment is up to date and properly
configured.</p>
