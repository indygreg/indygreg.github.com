      <description>Mercurial Server Hiccup 2014-11-06</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a hiccup on hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It resulted in prolonged
tree closures for Firefox.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094922">Bug 1094922</a>
tracks the issue.</p>
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>We noticed that many HTTP requests to hg.mozilla.org were getting 503
responses. On initial glance, the servers were healthy. CPU was below
100% utilization, I/O wait was reasonable. And there was little to no
swapping. Furthermore, the logs showed a healthy stream of requests
being successfully processed at levels that are typical. In other words,
it looked like business as usual on the servers.</p>
<p>Upon deeper investigation, we noticed that the WSGI process pool on the
servers was fully saturated. There were were 24 slots/processes per server
allocated to process Mercurial requests and all 24 of them were actively
processing requests. This created a backlog of requests that had been
accepted by the HTTP server but were waiting an internal dispatch/proxy
to WSGI. To the client, this would appear as a request with a long lag
before response generation.</p>
<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>This being an emergency (trees were already closed and developers were
effectively unable to use hg.mozilla.org), we decided to increase the
size of the WSGI worker pool. After all, we had CPU, I/O, and memory
capacity to spare and we could identify the root cause later. We first
bumped worker pool capacity from 24 to 36 and immediately saw a significant
reduction in the number of pending requests awaiting a WSGI worker. We
still had spare CPU, I/O, and memory capacity and were still seeing
requests waiting on a WSGI worker, so we bumped the capacity to 48
processes. At that time, we stopped seeing worker pool exhaustion and
all incoming requests were being handed off to a WSGI worker as soon as
they came in.</p>
<p>At this time, things were looking pretty healthy from the server end.</p>
<h2>Impact on Memory and Swapping</h2>
<p>Increasing the number of WSGI processes had the side-effect of
increasing the total amount of system memory used by Mercurial
processes in two ways. First, more processes means more memory. That
part is obvious. Second, more processes means fewer requests for each
process per unit of time and thus it takes longer for each process to
reach its max number of requests being being reaped. (It is a common
practice in servers to have a single process hand multiple requests.
This prevents overhead associated with spawning a new process and
loading possibly expensive context in it.)</p>
<p>We had our Mercurial WSGI processes configured to serve 100 requests
before being reaped. With the doubling of WSGI processes from 24 to 48,
those processes were lingering for 2x as long as before. Since the
Mercurial processes grow over time (they are aggressive about caching
repository data), this was slowly exhausting our memory pool.</p>
<p>It took a few hours, but a few servers started flirting with high swap
usage. (We don't expect the servers to swap.) This is how we identified
that memory use wasn't sane.</p>
<p>We lowered the maximum requests per process from 100 to 50 to match
the ratio increase in the WSGI worker pool.</p>
<h2>Mercurial Memory "Leak"</h2>
<p>When we started looking at the memory usage of WSGI processes in more
detail, we noticed something strange: RSS of Mercurial processes was
growing steadily when processes were streaming bundle data. This seemed
very odd to me. Being a Mercurial developer, I was pretty sure the
behavior was wrong.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4443">filed a bug</a> against
Mercurial.</p>
<p>I was able to reproduce the issue locally and started running a
bisection to find the regressing changeset. To my surprise, this issue
has been around since Mercurial 2.7!</p>
<p>I looked at the code in question, identified why so much memory was
being allocated, and submitted patches to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063518.html">stop an unbounded memory growth during clone/pull</a>
and to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063520.html">further reduce memory use during those operations</a>.
Both of those patches have been queued to go in the next stable release
of Mercurial, 3.2.1.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.2 is still not as memory efficient during clones as Mercurial
2.5.4. If I have time, I'd like to formulate more patches. But the
important fix - not growing memory unbounded during clone/pull - is
fixed.</p>
<p>Armed with the knowledge that Mercurial is leaky (although not a leak
in the traditional sense since the memory was eventually
getting garbage collected), we further reduced the max requests per
process from 50 to 20. This will cause processes to get reaped sooner
and will be more aggressive about keeping RSS growth in check.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>We suspect the root cause of the event is a network event.</p>
<p>Before this outage, we rarely had more than 10 requests being served
from the WSGI worker pool. In other words, we were often well below 50%
capacity. But something changed yesterday. More slots were being
occupied and high-bandwidth operations were taking longer to complete.
Kendall Libby noted that outbound traffic dropped by ~800 Mbps
during the event. For reasons that still haven't been identified, the
network became slower, clones weren't being processed as quickly, and
clients were occupying WSGI processes for longer amounts of time. This
eventually exhausted the available process pool, leading to HTTP 503's,
intermittent service availability, and a tree closure.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we noticed that in-flight HTTP requests are abnormally
high again this morning. However, because the servers are now configured
to handle the extra capacity, we seem to be powering through it without
any issues.</p>
<h2>In Hindsight</h2>
<p>You can make the argument that the servers weren't configured to serve
as much traffic as possible. After all, we were able to double the
WSGI process pool without hitting CPU, I/O, and memory limits.</p>
<p>The servers were conservatively configured. However, the worker pool
was initially configured at 2x CPU core count. And as a general rule of
thumb, you don't want your worker pool to be much greater than CPU
count because that introduces context switching and can give each
individual process a smaller slice of the CPU to process requests,
leading to higher latency. Since clone operations often manage to
peg a single CPU core, there is some justification for keeping the
ratio of WSGI workers to CPU count low. Furthermore, we rarely came
close to exhausting the WSGI worker pool before. There was little
to no justification for increasing capacity to a threshold not normally
seen.</p>
<p>But at the same time, even with 4x workers to CPU cores, our CPU
usage rarely flirts with 100% across all cores, even with the
majority of workers occupied. Until we actually hit CPU (or I/O)
limits, running a high multiplier seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Long term, we expect CPU usage during clone operations to drop
dramatically. Mike Hommey has contributed a patch to Mercurial that
allows servers to hand out a URL of a bundle file to fetch during
clone. So, a server can say <em>I have your data: fetch this static file
from S3 and then apply this small subset of the data that I'll give
you.</em> When properly deployed and used at Mozilla, this will effectively
drop server-side CPU usage for clones to nothing.</p>
<h2>Where to do Better</h2>
<p>There was a long delay between the Nagios alerts firing and someone
with domain-specific knowledge looking at the problem.</p>
<p>The trees could have reopened earlier. We were pretty confident about
the state of things at 1000. Trees opened in metered mode at 1246 and
completely at 1909. Although, the swapping issue wasn't mitigated until
1615, so you can argue that being conservative on the tree reopening
was justified. There is a chance that full reopening could have
triggered excessive swap and another round of chaos for everyone
involved.</p>
<p>We need an alert on WSGI pool exhaustion. It took longer than it should
have to identify this problem. However, now that we've encountered it,
it should be obvious if/when it happens again.</p>
<h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
<p>All times PST.</p>

      <description>The Rabbit Hole of Using Docker in Automated Tests</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Warning: This post is long and rambling. There is marginal value in
reading beyond the first few paragraphs unless you care about Docker.</strong></p>
<p>I recently wrote about
<a href="/blog/2014/10/14/robustly-testing-version-control-at-mozilla/">how Mozilla tests version control</a>.
In this post, I want to talk about the part of that effort that consumed
the most time: adding Docker support to the test harness.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Problem and Desired End State</h2>
<p>Running Docker containers inside tests just seems like an obvious thing
you'd want to do. I mean, wouldn't it be cool if your tests could spin
up MySQL, Redis, Cassandra, Nginx, etc inside Docker containers and test
things against actual instances of the things running in your data
centers? Of course it would! If you ask me, this approach beats
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocking</a> because many
questions around accuracy of the mocked interface are removed.
Furthermore, you can run all tests locally, while on a plane: no data
center or staging environment required. How cool is that! And,
containers are all isolated so there's no need to pollute your system
with extra packages and system services. Seems like wins all around.</p>
<p>When Mozilla started adding customizations to the
<a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a> code review software in
preparation for deploying it at Mozilla as a replacement for Bugzilla's
Splinter, it quickly became apparant that we had a significant testing
challenge ahead of us. We weren't just standing up Review Board and
telling people to use it, we were integrating user authentication with
Bugzilla, having Review Board update Bugzilla after key events, and
were driving the initiation of code review in Review Board by pushing
code to a Mercurial server. That's 3 user-visible services all
communicating with each to expose a unified workflow. It's the kind of
thing testing nightmares are made of.</p>
<p>During my early involvement with the project, I recognized the challenge
ahead and was quick to insist that we write automated tests for as much
as possible. I insisted that all the code (there are multiple extensions
to ReviewBoard, a Mercurial hook, and a Mercurial extension) live under
one common repository and share testing. That way we could tinker with
all the parts easily and test them in concern without having to worry
about version sync. We moved all the code to the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository and Review Board was the driving force behind improvements to
the test harness in that repository. We had Mercurial .t tests starting
Django dev servers hosting Review Board running from per-test SQLite
databases and all was nice. Pretty much every scenario involving
the interaction between Mercurial and ReviewBoard was tested. If you
cared about just these components, life was happy.</p>
<p>A large piece of the integration story was lacking in this testing
world: Bugzilla. We had somewhat complex code for having Review Board
and Bugzilla talk to each other but no tests for it because nobody
had yet hooked Bugzilla up to the tests. As my responsibilities in the
project expanded from covering just the Mercurial and Review Board
interaction to Bugzilla as well, I again looked at the situation and
thought <em>there's a lot of complex interaction here and alpha testing
has revealed the presence of many bugs: we need a better testing story.</em>
So, I set out to integrate Bugzilla into the test harness.</p>
<p>My goals were for Review Board tests to be able to make requests against
a Bugzilla instance configured just like
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>, to allow tests to
execute concurrently (don't make developers wait on machines), for
tests to run as quickly as possible, to run tests in an environment as
similar to production as possible, and to be able to run tests from a
plane or train or anywhere without internet connectivity. I was unwilling
to budge on these core testing requirements because they represent
what's best from test accuracy and developer productivity standpoints:
you want your tests to be representative of the real world and you want
to enable people to hack on this service anywhere, anytime, and not be
held back by tests that take too long to execute. Move fast and don't
break things.</p>
<p>Before I go on, it's time for a quick aside on tolerable waiting times.
Throughout this article I talk about minimizing the run time of tests.
This may sound like premature optimization. I argue it isn't, at least
not if you are optimizing for developer productivity. There is a fair
bit of academic research in this area.
<a href="http://cba.unl.edu/research/articles/548/download.pdf">A study on tolerable waiting time: how long are Web users willing to
wait</a>
gets cited a lot. It says 2 seconds for web content. If you read a few
paragraphs in, it references other literature. They disagree on specific
thresholds, but one thing is common: the thresholds are typically low -
just a few seconds. The latencies I deal with are all longer than
what research says leads to badness. When given a choice, I want to
optimize workflows for what humans are conditioned to tolerate. If I
can't do that, I've failed and the software will be ineffective.</p>
<p>The architecture of Bugzilla created some challenges and eliminated some
implementation possibilities. First, I wasn't using any Bugzilla: I was
using Mozilla's <em>branch</em> of Bugzilla that powers bugzilla.mozilla.org.
Let's call it BMO. I <em>could</em> try hosting it from local SQLite files
and running a local, Perl-based HTTP server (Bugzilla is written in
Perl). But my experience with Perl and takeaways from talking to the
BMO admins was that pain would likely be involved. Plus, this would be
a departure from test accuracy. So, I would be using MySQL, Apache HTTPd,
and mod_perl, just like BMO uses them in production.</p>
<p>Running Apache and MySQL is always a... fun endeavor. It wasn't a strict
requirement, but I also highly preferred that the tests didn't pollute the
system they ran on. In other words, having tests connect to an
already-running MySQL or Apache server felt like the wrong solution. That's
just one more thing people must set up and run locally to run the tests.
That's just one more thing that could differ from production and cause
bad testing results. It felt like a dangerous approach. Plus, there's
the requirement to run things concurrently. Could I have multiple tests
talking to the same MySQL server concurrently? They'd have to use
separate databases so they don't conflict. That's a possibility.
Honestly, I didn't entertain the thought of running Apache and MySQL
manually for too long. I knew about this thing called Docker and that it
theoretically fit my use case perfectly: construct building blocks for
your application and then dymanically hook things up. Perfect. I could
build Docker containers for all the required services and have each test
start a new, independent set of containers for just that test.</p>
<p>So, I set out integrating Docker into the version-control-tools test
harness. Specifically, my goal was to enable the running of independent
BMO instances during individual tests. It sounded simple enough.</p>
<p>What I didn't know was that integrating a Dockerized BMO into the test
harness would take the better part of 2 weeks. And it's still not up to
my standards. This post is the story about the trials and tribulations I
encountered along the way. I hope it serves as a warning and potentially
a guide for others attempting similar feats. If any Docker developers
are reading, I hope it gives you ideas on how to improve Docker.</p>
<h2>Running Bugzilla inside Docker</h2>
<p>First thing's first: to run BMO inside Docker I needed to make Docker
containers for BMO. Fortunately, David Lawrence has
<a href="https://github.com/dklawren/docker-bugzilla">prior art</a> here. I
<strong>really</strong> just wanted to take that code, dump it into
version-control-tools and call it a day. In hindsight, I probably should
have done that. Instead, armed with the knowledge of the Docker best
practice of <em>one container per service</em> and David Lawrence's similar
wishes to make his code conform to that ideal, I decided to spend some
time to <em>fix</em> David's code so that MySQL and Apache were in separate
containers, not part of a single container running supervisord. Easy
enough, right?</p>
<p>It was relatively easy extracting the MySQL and Apache parts of BMO into
separate containers. For MySQL, I started with the
<a href="https://github.com/docker-library/mysql">official MySQL container</a> from
the Docker library and added a custom <em>my.cnf</em>. Simple enough. For
Apache, I just copied everything from David's code that wasn't MySQL.
I was able to manually hook the containers together using the Docker
CLI. It sort of just worked. I was optimistic this project would only
take a few hours.</p>
<h2>A garbage collection bug in Docker</h2>
<p>My first speed bump came as I was iterating on Dockerfiles. All of a
sudden I get an error from Docker that it is out of space. Wat? I look
at <em>docker images</em> and don't see anything too obvious eating up space.
What could be going on? At this point, I'm using
<a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker">boot2docker</a> to host
Docker. boot2docker is this nifty tool that allows Windows and OS X
users to easily run Docker (Docker requires a Linux host). boot2docker
spins up a Linux virtual machine running Docker and tells you how to
point your local <em>docker</em> CLI interface at that VM. So, when Docker
complains it is out of space, I knew immediately that the VM must be low
on space. I SSH into it, run <em>df</em>, and sure enough, the VM is nearly out
of space. But I looked at <em>docker images -a</em> and confirmed there's not
enough data to fill the disk. What's going on? I can't find the issue
right now, but it turns out there is a bug in Docker! When running
Docker on aufs filesystems (like boot2docker does), Docker does not
always remove
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#creating-and-mounting-a-data-volume-container">data volumes containers</a>
when deleting a container. It turns out that the MySQL containers from
the official Docker library were creating a data-only container to hold
persistent MySQL data that outlives the container itself. These
containers are apparently light magic. They are containers that are
attached to other containers, but they don't really show up in the
Docker interfaces. When you delete the <em>host</em> container, these
containers are supposed to be garbage collected. Except on aufs, they
aren't. My MySQL containers were creating 1+ GB InnoDB data files on
start and the associated data containers were sitting around after
container deletion, effectively leaking 1+ GB every time I created a
MySQL container, quickly filling the boot2docker disk. Derp.</p>
<p>I worked around this problem by <em>forking</em> the official MySQL container.
I didn't need persistent MySQL data (the containers only need to live
for one invocation - for the lifetime of a single test), so I couldn't
care less about persisted data volumes. So, I
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/rev/68eca557382b">changed</a>
the MySQL container to hold its data locally, not in a data volume
container. The solution was simple enough. But it took me a while to
identify the problem. Here I was seeing Docker do something extremely
stupid. Surely my understanding of Docker was wrong and I was doing
something stupid to cause it to leak data. I spent hours digging through
the documentation to make sure I was doing things exactly as
recommended. It wasn't until I started an Ubuntu VM and tried the same
thing there did I realize this looked like a bug in boot2docker. A few
Google searches later led me to a comment hiding at the bottom of an
existing GitHub issue that pins aufs as the culprit. And here I thought
Docker reached 1.0 and wouldn't have bad bugs like this. I certainly
wouldn't expect boot2docker to be shipping a VM with a sub-par storage
driver (shouldn't it be using devicemapper or btrfs instead). Whatever.</p>
<h2>Wrangling with Mozilla's Branch of Bugzilla</h2>
<p>At this point, I've got basic Docker containers for MySQL and
Apache+mod_perl+Bugzilla being created. Now, I needed to convert from
vanilla Bugzilla to BMO. Should be straightforward. Just change the Git
remote URL and branch to check out. I did this and all-of-a-sudden my
image started encountering errors building! It turns out that the BMO
code base doesn't work on a fresh database! Fortunately, this is a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=769829">known issue</a> and
I've worked around it previously. When I tackled it a few months ago, I
spent a handful of hours disecting this problem. It wasn't pretty. But
this time I knew what to do. I even had a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/a15c08c2fac1/testing/puppet/manifests/bugzilla.pp">Puppet manifest</a>
for installing BMO on a fresh machine. So, I just needed to translate
that Puppet config into Dockerfile commands. No big deal, right? Well,
when I did that Puppet config a few months ago, I based it on Ubuntu
because I'm more familiar with Debian-based distros and figured Ubuntu
would be the easiest since it tends to have the largest package
diversity. Unfortunately, David's Docker work is based on Fedora. So, I
spent some time converting the Dockerfile to Ubuntu rather than trying
to port things to Fedora. Arguably the wrong decision since Mozilla
operates the RedHat flavor of Linux distributions in production. But I
was willing to trade accuracy for time here, having lost time dealing
with the aufs bug.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I under-estimated how long it would take to port the image
to Ubuntu. It didn't take so long from a code change perspective.
Instead, most of the time was spent waiting for Docker to run the
commands to build the image. In the final version, Apt is downloading
and installing over 250 packages. And Bugzilla's bootstrap process
installs dozens of packages from CPAN. Every time I made a small change,
I invalidated Docker's image building cache, causing extreme delays
while waiting for Apt and CPAN to do their thing. This experience
partially contributed to my
<a href="/blog/2014/10/13/deterministic-and-minimal-docker-images/">displeasure with how Docker currently handles image creation</a>.
If Docker images were composed of pre-built pieces instead of stacked
commands, my cache hit rate would have been much higher and I would have
converted the image in no time. But no, that's not how things work.
So I lost numerous hours through this 2 week process waiting for Docker
images to perform operations I've already done elsewhere dozens of times
before.</p>
<h2>Docker Container Orchestration</h2>
<p>After porting the Bugzilla image to Ubuntu and getting BMO to bootstrap
in a manually managed container (up to this point I'm using the <em>docker</em>
CLI to create images, start containers, etc), it was time to automate
the process so that tests could run the containers. At this time, I
started looking for tools that performed multiple container
orchestration. I had multiple containers that needed to be treated as a
single logical unit, so I figured I'd use an existing tool to solve this
problem for me. Don't reinvent the wheel unless you have to, right?
I discovered <a href="http://www.fig.sh/">Fig</a>, which seemed to fit the bill. I
read that it is being integrated into Docker itself, so it must be best
of breed. Even if it weren't its future seems to be more certain than
other tools. So, I stopped my tools search and used Fig without much
consideration for other tools.</p>
<h2>Lack of a useful feature in Fig</h2>
<p>I quickly
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/a15c08c2fac1/testing/docker/fig-bmo/fig.yml">whipped up a fig.yml</a>
and figured it would <em>just work</em>. Nope! Starting the containers from
scratch using Fig resulted in an error. I wasn't sure what the error was
at first because Fig didn't tell me. After some investigation, I
realized that my <em>bmoweb</em> container (the container holding Apache + BMO
code) was failing in its
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#entrypoint">entrypoint</a>
command (that's a command that runs when the container starts up, but
not the primary command a container runs - that's a bit confusing I know -
read the docs). I added some debug statements and quickly realized that
Bugzilla was erroring connecting to MySQL. Strange, I thought. Fig is
essentially a DSL around manual <em>docker</em> commands, so I checked
everything by typing everything into the shell. No error. Again on a new
set of containers. No error. I thought maybe my environment variable
handling was wrong - that the dynamically allocated IP address and port
number of the linked MySQL container being passed to the <em>bmoweb</em>
container weren't getting honored. I added some logging to disprove that
theory. The wheels inside my brain spun for a little bit. And, aided by
some real-time logging, I realized I was dealing with a race condition:
Fig was starting the MySQL and <em>bmoweb</em> containers concurrently and
<em>bmoweb</em> was attempting to access the MySQL server <em>before</em> MySQL had
fully initialized and started listening on its TCP port! That made
sense. And I think it's a reasonable optimization for Fig to start
containers concurrently to speed up start time. But surely a tool that
orchestrates different containers has considered the problem of
dependencies and has a mechanism to declare them to prevent these race
conditions. I check the online docs and there's nothing to be found.
A red panda weeps. So, I change the <em>bmoweb</em> entrypoint script to
wait until it can open a TCP socket to MySQL before actually using MySQL
and sure enough, the race condition goes away and the <em>bmoweb</em> container
starts just fine!</p>
<p>OK, I'm real close now. I can feel it.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping Bugzilla</h2>
<p>I start playing around with manually starting and stopping containers as
part of a toy test. The good news is things appear to work. The bad news
is it is extremely slow. It didn't take long for me to realize that the
reason for the slowness is Bugzilla's bootstrap on first run. Bugzilla,
like many complex applications, has a first run step that sets up
database schema, writes out some files on the filesystem, inserts some
skeleton data in the database, creates an admin user, etc. Much to my
dismay this was taking a long time. Something on the order of 25 to 30
seconds. And that's on a Haswell with plenty of RAM and an SSD. Oy. The
way things are currently implemented would result in a 25 to 30 second
delay when running every test. Change 1 line and wait say 25s for any
kind of output. Are you kidding me?! Unacceptable. It violated my core
goal of having tests that are quick to run. Again, humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>I think about this problem for like half a second and the solution is
obvious: take a snapshot of the bootstrapped images and start instances
of that snapshot from tests. In other words, you perform the common
bootstrap operations once and only once. And, you can probably do that
outside the scope of running tests so that the same snapshot can be used
across multiple invocations of the test harness. Sounds simple!
To the Docker uninitiated, it sounds like the solution would be to move
the BMO bootstrapping into the Dockerfile code so it gets executed at
image creation time. Yes, that would be ideal. Unfortunately, when
building images via Dockerfile, you can't tell Docker to link that image
to another container. Without container linking, you can't have MySQL.
Without MySQL, you can't do BMO bootstrap. So, BMO bootstrap must be
done during container startup. And in Docker land, that means putting it
as part of your entrypoint script (where it was conveniently already
located for this reason).</p>
<h2>Talking Directly to the Docker API</h2>
<p>Of course, the tools that I found that help with Docker image building
and container orchestration don't seem to have an answer for this
<em>create a snapshot of a bootstrapped container</em> problem. I'm sure
<em>someone</em> has solved this problem. But in my limited searching, I
couldn't find anything. And, I figured the problem would be easy enough
to solve manually, so I set about creating a script to do it. I'm not a
huge fan of shell script for automation. It's hard to debug and simple
things can be hard and hard things can be harder. Plus, why solve
solutions such as parsing output for relevant data when you can talk to
an API directly and get native types. Since the existing
test harness automation in version-control-tools was written in Python,
I naturally decided to write some Python to create the bootstrapped
images. So, I do a PyPI search and discover
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-py">docker-py</a>, a Python client
library to the
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/">Docker Remote API</a>,
an HTTP API that the Docker daemon runs and is what the <em>docker</em> CLI
tool itself uses to interface with Docker. Good, now I have access to
the full power of Docker and am not limited by what the <em>docker</em> CLI may
not expose. So, I spent some time looking at source and the Docker
Remote API documentation to get an understanding of my new abilities and
what I'd need to do. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the
<em>docker</em> CLI is pretty similar to the Remote API and the Python API
was similar as well, so the learning was pretty shallow. Yay for
catching a break!</p>
<h2>Confusion Over Container Stopping</h2>
<p>I wrote some Python for building the BMO images, launching the
containers, committing the result, and saving state to disk (so it could
be consulted later - preventing a bootstrap by subsequent consumers).
This was pleasantly smooth at first, but I encountered some bumps along
the way. First, I didn't have a complete grasp on the differences
between <em>stop</em> and <em>kill</em>. I was seeing some weird behavior by MySQL
on startup and didn't know why. Turns out I was forcefully killing the
container after bootstrap via the <em>kill</em> API and this was sending
a <em>SIGKILL</em> to MySQL, effectively causing unclean shutdown. After some
documentation reading, I realized <em>stop</em> is the better API - it issues
<em>SIGTERM</em>, waits for a grace period, then issues <em>SIGKILL</em>. Issuing
<em>SIGTERM</em> made MySQL shut down gracefully and this issue stemming from
my ignorance was resolved. (If anyone from Docker is reading, I think
the help output for <em>docker kill</em> should mention the forcefullness of
the command versus <em>stop</em>. Not all of us remember the relative
forcefullness of the POSIX signals and having documentation reinforce
their cryptic meaning could help people select the proper command.)
A few lines of Python later and I was talking directly to the Docker
Remote API, doing everything I needed to do to save (<em>commit</em> in Docker
parlance) a bootstrapped BMO environment for re-use among multiple
tests.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy to hook the bootstrapped images up to a single test.
Just load the bootstrapped image IDs from the config file and start new
containers based on them. That's Docker 101 (except I was using Python
to do everything).</p>
<h2>Concurrent Execution Confuses Bugzilla</h2>
<p>Now that I could start Dockerized BMO from a single test, it was time to
make things work concurrently. I hooked Docker up to a few tests and
launched them in parallel to see what would happen. The containers
appeared to start just fine! Great anticipation on my part to
design for concurrency from the beginning, I thought. It appeared I was
nearly done. Victory was near. So, I changed some tests to actually
interact with BMO running from Docker. (Up until this point I was merely
starting containers, not doing anything with them.) Immediately I see
errors. <em>Cannot connect to Bugzilla http://... connection refused.</em> Huh?
It took a few moments, but I realized the experience I had with MySQL
starting and this error were very similar. I changed my <em>start BMO
containers</em> code to wait for the HTTP server's TCP socket to start
accepting connections before returning control and sure enough, I was
able to make HTTP requests against Bugzilla running in Docker! Woo!</p>
<p>Next step, make an authenticated query against Bugzilla running in
Docker. HTTP request completes... with an internal server error. What?!
I successfully browsed BMO from containers days before and was able to
log in just fine - this shouldn't be happening. This problem took me
ages to diagnose. I traced every step of provisioning and couldn't
figure out what was going on. After resorting to print debugging in
nearly every component, including Bugzilla's Perl code itself, I found
the culprit: Bugzilla wasn't liking the dynamic nature of the MySQL and
HTTP endpoints. You see, when you start Docker containers, network
addresses change. The IP address assigned to the container is whatever
is available to Docker at the time the container was started. Likewise
the IP address and port number of linked services can change. So, your
container entrypoint has to deal with this dynamic nature of addresses.
For example, if you have a configuration file, you need to update that
configuration file on every run with the proper network address info.
My Bugzilla entrypoint script was doing this. Or so I thought. It turns
out that Bugzilla's bootstrap process has multiple config files. There's
an <em>answers</em> file that provides static answers to questions asked when
running the bootstrap script (<em>checksetup.pl</em>). <em>checksetup.pl</em> will
produce a <em>localconfig</em> file (actually a Perl script) containing all
that data. There's also a <em>data/params</em> file containing yet more
configuration options. And, the way I was running bootstrap,
<em>checksetup.pl</em> refused to update files with new values. I initially had
the entrypoint script updating only the answers file and running
<em>checksetup.pl</em>, thinking <em>checksetup.pl</em> would update localconfig if
the answers change. Nope! <em>checksetup.pl</em> only appears to update
<em>localconfig</em> if <em>localconfig</em> is missing a value. So, here my
entrypoint script was, successully calling <em>checksetup.pl</em> with the
proper network values, which <em>checksetup.pl</em> was more than happy to use.
But when I started the web application, it used the old values from
<em>localconfig</em> and <em>data/params</em> and blew up. Derp. So, to have
dynamic MySQL hosts and ports and a dynamic self-referential HTTP URL, I
needed to manually update <em>localconfig</em> and <em>data/params</em> during the
entrypoint script. The entrypoint script now
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/a15c08c2fac1/testing/docker/builder-bmoweb/entrypoint.py#l157">rewrites Perl scripts</a>
during container load to reflect appropriate variables. Oy.</p>
<h2>Resource Constraints</h2>
<p>At some point I got working BMO containers running concurrently from
multiple tests. This was a huge milestone. But it only revealed my next
problem: resource constraints. The running containers were consuming
gobs of memory and I couldn't run more than 2 or 3 tests concurrently
before running out of memory. Before, I was able to run 8 tests
concurrently no problem. Well crap, I just slowed down the test harness
significantly by reducing concurrency. No bueno.</p>
<p>Some quick investigation revealed the culprit was MySQL and Apache being
greedier than they needed to be. MySQL was consuming 1GB RSS on start.
Apache was something like 350 MB. It had been a while since I ran a
MySQL server, so I had to scour the net for settings to put MySQL on a
diet. The results were not promising. I knew enough about MySQL to know
that the answers I found had similar quality to comments on the php.net
function documentation circa 2004 (it was not uncommon to see things
like SQL injection in the MySQL pages back then - who knows, maybe
that's still the case). Anyway, a little tuning later and I was able to
get MySQL using a few hundred MB RAM and I reduced the Apache worker
pool to something reasonable (maybe 2) to free up enough memory to be
able to run tests with the desired concurrency again. If using Docker as
part of testing ever takes off, I imagine there will be two flavors of
every container: low memory and regular. I'm not running a production
service here: I'll happily trade memory for high-end performance as long
as it doesn't impact my tests too much.</p>
<h2>Caching, Invalidating, and Garbage Collecting Bootstrapped Images</h2>
<p>As part of iterating on making BMO bootstrap work, I encountered another
problem: knowing when to perform a bootstrap. As mentioned earlier,
bootstrap was slow: 25 to 30 seconds. While I had reduced the cost of
bootstrap to at most once per test suite execution (as opposed to once
per test), there was still the potential for a painful 25-30s delay when
running tests. Unacceptable! Furthermore, when I changed how bootstrap
worked, I needed a way to invalidate the previous bootstrapped image.
Otherwise, we may use an outdated bootstrapped image that doesn't
represent the environment it needs to and test execution would fail. How
should I do this?</p>
<p>Docker has considered this problem and they have a solution: <em>build
context</em>. When you do a <em>docker build</em>, Docker takes all the files from
the directory containing the <em>Dockerfile</em> and makes them available to
the environment doing the building. If you <em>ADD</em> one of these files in
your Dockerfile, the image ID will change if the file changes,
invalidating the cache used by Docker to build images. So, if I <em>ADD</em>ed
the scripts that perform BMO bootstrap to my Docker images, Docker would
automagically invalidate the built images and force a bootstrap for me.
Nice! Unfortunately, <em>docker build</em> doesn't allow you to add files
outside of the current directory to the build context. Internet
sleuthing reveals the solution here is to copy things to a temporary
directory and run <em>docker build</em> from that. Seriously? Fortunately, I
was using the Docker API directly via Python. And that API simply takes
an archive of files. And since you can create archives dynamically
inside Python using e.g.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tarfile.html">tarfile</a>, it wasn't too
difficult to build proper custom context archives that contained my extra
data that could be used to invalidate bootstrapped images. I threw some
simple <em>ADD</em> directives into my Dockerfiles and now I got bootstrapped
image invalidation!</p>
<p>To avoid having to perform bootstrap on every test run, I needed a
mapping between the base images and the bootstrapped result. I ended up
storing this in a simple JSON file. I realize now I could have queried
Docker for images having the base image as its parent since there is
supposed to be a 1:1 relationship between them. I may do this as a
follow-up.</p>
<p>With the look-up table in place, ensuring bootstrapped images were
current involved doing a couple <em>docker build</em>s, finding the
bootstrapped images from those base images, and doing the bootstrap if
necessary. If everything is up-to-date, <em>docker build</em> finishes quickly
and we have less than 1s of delay. Very acceptable. If things aren't
current, well, there's not much you can do there if accuracy is
important. I was happy with where I was.</p>
<p>Once I started producing bootstrapped images every time the code
impacting the generation of that image changed, I ran into a new
problem: garbage collection. All those old bootstrapped images were
piling up inside of Docker! I needed a way to prune them. Docker has
support for associating a <em>repository</em> and a <em>tag</em> with images. Great, I
thought, I'll just associate all images with a well-defined repository,
leave the tag blank (because it isn't really relevant), and garbage
collection will iterate over all images in to-be-pruned repositories
and delete all but the most recent one. Of course, this simple solution
did not work. As far as I can tell, Docker doesn't really let you have
multiple untagged images. You can set a repository with no tag and
Docker will automagically assign the <em>latest</em> tag to that image. But the
second you create a new image in that repository, the original image
loses that repository association. I'm not sure if this is by design or
a bug, but it feels wrong to me. I want the ability to associate <em>tags</em>
with images (and containers) so I can easily find all entities in a
logical set. It seemed to me that <em>repository</em> facilitated that need
(albeit with the restriction of only associating 1 identifier per
image). My solution here was to assign type 1 UUIDs to the tag field for
each image. This forced Docker to retain the <em>repository</em> association
when new images were created. I chose type 1 UUIDs so I can later
extract the time component embedded within and do time-based garbage
collection e.g. <em>delete all images created more than a week ago</em>.</p>
<h2>Making Things Work in Jenkins/Ubuntu</h2>
<p>At about this point, I figured things were working well enough on my
boot2docker machine that it was time to update the Jenkins virtual
machine / Vagrant configuration to run Docker. So, I hacked up the
provisioner to install the <em>docker.io</em> package and tried to run things.
First, I had to update code that talks to Docker to know where Docker is
in an Ubuntu VM. Before, I was keying things off DOCKER_HOST, which I
guess is used by the <em>docker</em> CLI and boot2docker reminds you to set.
Easy enough. When I finally got things talking to Docker, my scripts
threw a cryptic error when talking to Docker. Huh? This worked in
boot2docker! When in doubt, always check your package versions. Sure
enough, Ubuntu was installing an old Docker version. I added the Docker
Apt repo to the Vagrant provisioner and tried again. Bingo - working
Docker in an Ubuntu VM!</p>
<h2>Choice of storage engines</h2>
<p>I started building the BMO Docker images quickly noticed something:
building images was horribly slow. Specifically, the part where new
images are committed was taking seemingly forever. 5 to 8 seconds or
something. Ugh. This wouldn't really bother me except due to subsequent
issues, I found myself changing images enough as part of debugging that
image building latency became a huge time sink. I felt I was spending
more time waiting for layers to commit than making progress. So, I
I decided to do something about it. I remembered glancing at an
<a href="https://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/09/30/overview-storage-scalability-docker/">overview of storage options in Docker</a>
the week or two prior. I instinctively pinned the difference on
different storage drivers between boot2docker and Ubuntu. Sure enough,
boot2docker was using aufs and Ubuntu was using devicemapper. OK, now I
identified a potential culprit. Time to test the theory. A few
paragraphs into that blog post, I see a sorted list of storage driver
priorities. I see aufs first, btrfs second, and devicemapper third. I
know aufs has kernel inclusion issues (plus a nasty data leakage bug). I
don't want that. devicemapper is slow. I figured the list is ordered for
a reason and just attempted to use btrfs without really reading the
article. Sure enough, btrfs is much faster at committing images
than devicemapper. And, it isn't aufs. While images inside btrfs are
building, I glance over the article and come to the conclusion that
btrfs is in fact good enough for me.</p>
<p>So now I'm running Docker on btrfs on Ubuntu and Docker on aufs in
boot2docker. Hopefully that will be the last noticable difference
between host environments. After all, Docker is supposed to abstract
all this away, right? I wish.</p>
<h2>The Mystery of Inconsistent State</h2>
<p>It was here that I experienced the most baffling, mind bending puzzle
yet. As I was trying to get things working on the Jenkins/Ubuntu VM -
things that had already been proved out in boot2docker - I was running
into inexplicable issues during creation of the bootstrapped BMO
containers. It seemed that my bootstrapped containers were somehow
missing data. It appeared as if bootstrap had completed but data written
during bootstrap failed to write. You start the committed/bootstrapped
image and bootstrap had obviously completed partially, but it appeared
to have never finished. Same Docker version. Same images. Same build
scripts. Only the host environment was different. Ummmm, Bueller?</p>
<p>This problem had me totally and completely flabbergasted. My brain
turned to mush exhausting possibilities. My initial instinct was this
was a filesystem buffering problem. Different storage driver (btrfs vs
aufs) means different semantics in how data is flushed, right? I once
again started littering code with print statements to record the presence
or non-presence of files and content therein. MySQL wasn't seeing all its
data, so I double and triple check I'm shutting down MySQL correctly.
Who knows, maybe one of the options I used to trim the fat from MySQL
removed some of the safety from writing data and unclean shutdown is
causing MySQL to lose data?</p>
<p>While I was investigating this problem, I noticed an additional oddity:
I was having trouble getting reliable debug output from running
containers (<em>docker log -f</em>). It seemed as if I was losing log
events. I could tell from the state of a container that something
happened, but I was seeing no evidence from <em>docker logs -f</em> that that
thing actually happened. Weird! On a hunch, a threw some
<em>sys.stdout.flush()</em> calls in my Python scripts, and sure enough my
missing output started arriving! Pipe buffering strikes again.
So, now we have
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/a15c08c2fac1/testing/docker/builder-bmoweb/entrypoint.py#l18">dirty</a>
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/a15c08c2fac1/testing/docker-control.py#l48">hacks</a>
in all the Python scripts related to Docker to unbuffer stdout to
prevent data loss. Don't ask how much time was wasted tracking down bad
theories due to stdout output being buffered.</p>
<p>Getting back to the problem at hand, I still hand Docker containers
seemingly lose data. And it was only happening when Ubuntu/btrfs was
the host environment for Docker. I eventually exhausted all leads in my
<em>filesystem wasn't flushed</em> theory. At some point, I compared the logs
of <em>docker logs -f</em> between boot2docker and Ubuntu and eventually
noticed that the <em>bmoweb</em> container in Ubuntu wasn't printing as much.
This wasn't obvious at first because the output from bootstrap on Ubuntu
looked fine. Besides, the script that waits for bootstrap to complete
waits for the Apache HTTP TCP socket to come alive before it gracefully
stops the container and snapshots the bootstrapped result: bootstrap
<em>must</em> be completing, ignore what <em>docker logs -f</em> says.</p>
<p>Eventually I hit an impasse and resort to context dumping <em>everything</em>
on IRC. Ben Kero is around and he picks up on something almost
immediately. He simply says <em>... systemd?</em>. I knew almost instantly
what he was referring to and knew the theory fit the facts. Do you know
what I was doing wrong?</p>
<p>I still don't know what and quite frankly I don't care, but something in
my Ubuntu host environment had a trigger on the TCP port the HTTP server
would be listening on. Remember, I was detecting bootstrap completion by
waiting until a TCP socket could be opened to the HTTP server. As soon
as that connection was established, we stopped the containers gracefully
and took a snapshot of the bootstrapped result. Except on Ubuntu
something was accepting that socket open, giving a false positive to
my wait code, and triggering early shutdown. Docker issued the signal to
stop the container gracefully, but it wasn't finished bootstrapping yet,
so it forcefully killed the container, resulting in bootstrap being in
a remarkably-consistent-across-runs inconsistent state. Changing the
code from <em>wait on TCP socket</em> to <em>wait for valid HTTP response</em> fixed
the problem. And just for good measure, I changed the code waiting on
the MySQL server to also try to establish an actual connection to the
MySQL application layer, not merely a TCP socket.</p>
<p>After solving this mystery, I thought there's no way I could be so blind
as to not see the container receiving the stop signal during bootstrap.
So, I changed things back to prove to myself I wasn't on crack. No
matter how hard I tried, I could not get the logs to show that the
signal was received. I think what was happening was that my script was
starting the container and issuing the graceful stop so quickly that it
wasn't captured by log clients. Sure enough, adding some sleeps in the
proper places made it possible to catch the events in action. In
hindsight, I suppose I could have used <em>docker events</em> to shed some
light on this as well. If Docker persisted logs/output from containers
and allowed me to scroll back in time, I think this would have saved me.
Although, there's a chance my entrypoint script wouldn't have informed
me about the received signal. Perhaps <em>checksetup.pl</em> was ignoring it?
What I really need is a unified event + log stream from Docker
containers so I can debug exactly what's going on.</p>
<h2>Everything is Working, Right?</h2>
<p>After solving the inconsistent bootstrap state problem, things were
looking pretty good. I had BMO bootstrapping and running from tests on
both boot2docker and Ubuntu hosts. Tests were seeing completely
independent environments and there were no race conditions. I was nearly
done.</p>
<p>So, I started porting more and more tests to Docker. I started running
tests more and more. Things worked. Most of the time. But I'm still
frustrated by periodic apparent bugs in Docker. For example, our
containers periodically fail to shut down. Our images periodically fail
to delete.</p>
<p>During container shutdown and delete at the end of tests, we periodically
see error messagess like the following:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>docker.errors.APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (&quot;Cannot destroy container f13828df94c9d295bfe24b69ac02377a757edcf948a3355cf7bc16ff2de84255: Driver aufs failed to remove root filesystem f13828df94c9d295bfe24b69ac02377a757edcf948a3355cf7bc16ff2de84255: rename /mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/f13828df94c9d295bfe24b69ac02377a757edcf948a3355cf7bc16ff2de84255 /mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/f13828df94c9d295bfe24b69ac02377a757edcf948a3355cf7bc16ff2de84255-removing: device or resource busy&quot;)
</pre></div>

<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (&quot;Cannot destroy container 7e87e5950501734b2a1c02705e9c19f65357a15bad605d8168452aa564d63786: Unable to remove filesystem for 7e87e5950501734b2a1c02705e9c19f65357a15bad605d8168452aa564d63786: remove /mnt/sda1/var/lib/docker/containers/7e87e5950501734b2a1c02705e9c19f65357a15bad605d8168452aa564d63786: directory not empty&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>Due to the way we're executing tests (Mercurial's .t test format), this
causes the test's output to change and the test to fail. Sadness.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> these errors are limited to boot2docker/aufs. But we haven't
executed enough test runs in the Jenkins/Ubuntu/btrfs VM yet to be sure.
This definitely smells like a bug in Docker and it is very annoying.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After much wrangling and going deeper in a rabbit hole than I ever felt
was possible, I finally managed to get BMO running inside Docker as part
of our test infrastructure. We're now building tests for complicated
components that touch Mercurial, Review Board, and Bugzilla and people
are generally happy with how things work.</p>
<p>There are still a handful of bugs, workarounds, and components that
aren't as optimal as I would like them to be. But you can't always have
perfection.</p>
<p>My takeaway from this ordeal is that Docker still has a number of
bugs and user experience issues to resolve. I <strong>really</strong> want to support
Docker and to see it succeed. But every time I try doing something
non-trivial with Docker, I get bit hard. Yes, some of the
issues I experienced were due to my own ignorance. But at the same time,
if one of Docker's mantras is about simplicity and usability, then
should there be such gaping cracks for people like me to fall through?</p>
<p>In the end, the promise of Docker fits my use case almost perfectly. I
know the architecture is a good fit for testing. We will likely stick
with Docker, especially now that I've spent the time to make it work. I
really wish this project would have taken a few days, not a few weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Robustly Testing Version Control at Mozilla</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Version control services and interaction with them play an important
role at any company. Despite version control being a critical part
of your infrastructure, my experience from working at a few companies
and talking with others is that version control often doesn't get the
testing love that other services do. Hooks get written, spot-tested
by the author, and deployed. Tools that interact with version control
often rely on behavior that may or may not change over time,
especially when the version of your version control software is
upgraded.</p>
<p>We've seen this pattern at Mozilla. Mercurial hooks and extensions
were written and deployed to the server without test coverage. As a
result, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1070637">things break</a>
when we try to upgrade the server. This happens a few times and you
naturally develop an attitude of fear, uncertainty, and doubt around
touching anything on the server (or the clients for that matter). <em>If
it isn't broken, why fix it</em> prevails for months or years. Then one an
enthusiastic individual comes around wanting to deploy some hot new
functionality. You tell them the path is arduous because the server is
running antiquated versions of software and nothing is tested. The
individual realizes the amazing change isn't worth the effort and
justifiably throws up their hands and gives up. This is almost a
textbook definition of how not having test coverage can result
in technical debt. This is the position Mozilla is trying to recover
from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts I've had since joining the Developer Services
Team at Mozilla a little over a month ago has been changing the story
about how we test version control at Mozilla.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that Mozilla now has a robust enough testing
infrastructure in place around our Mercurial server that we're feeling
pretty good about silencing the doubters when it comes to changing
server behavior. Here's how we did it.</p>
<p>The genesis of this project was likely me getting involved with the
hg-git and Mercurial projects. For hg-git, I learned a bit about
Mercurial internals and how extensions work. When I looked at Mercurial
extensions and hooks used by Mozilla, I started to realize what parts
were good and what parts were bad. I realized what parts would likely
break after upgrades. When I started contributing patches to Mercurial
itself, I took notice of how Mercurial is tested. When I discovered
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests">T Tests</a>, I thought,
<em>wow, that's pretty cool: we should use them to test Mozilla's Mercurial
customizations!</em></p>
<p>After some frustrations with Mercurial extensions breaking after
Mercurial upgrades, I wanted to do something about it to prevent this from
happening again. I'm a
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">huge fan of unified repositories</a>.
So earlier this year, I reached out to the various parties who maintain
all the different components and convinced nearly everyone that
establishing a single repository for all the version control code was a
<a href="/blog/2014/02/05/new-repository-for-mozilla-version-control-tools/">good idea</a>.
The <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository was born. Things were slow at first. It was initially pretty
much my playground for hosting Mercurial extensions that I authored.
Fast forward a few months, and the version-control-tools repository now

authored by Mozillians, including
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/pushlog-legacy">pushlog</a>.
Having all the code in one repository has been very useful. It has
simplified server deployments: we now pull 1 repository instead of 3. If
there is a dependency between different components, we can do the update
atomically. These are all benefits of using a single repository instead
of N&gt;1.</p>
<p>While version-control-tools was still pretty much my personal
playground, I introduced a short script for running tests. It was pretty
basic: just find test files and invoke them with Mercurial's test
harness. It served my needs pretty well. Over time, as more and more
functionality was rolled into version-control-tools, we expanded the
scope of the test harness.</p>
<p>We can now run Python unit tests (in addition to Mercurial .t tests).
Test all of the things!</p>
<p>We set up <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/">continuous integration</a>
with Jenkins so tests run after check-in and alert us when things fail.</p>
<p>We added <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/coveragepy/?">code coverage</a>
so we can see what is and isn't being tested. Using code coverage data,
we've
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075274">identified a server upgrade bug</a>
before it happens. We're also using the data to ensure that code is tested
as thoroughly as it needs to be. The code coverage data has been
invaluable at assessing the quality of our tests. I'm still shocked that
Firefox developers tolerate not having JavaScript code coverage when
developing Firefox features. (I'm not saying code coverage is perfect,
merely that it is a valuable tool in your arsenal.)</p>
<p>We added support for running tests against multiple versions of
Mercurial. We even test the bleeding edge of Mercurial so we know when
an upstream Mercurial change breaks our code. So, no more surprises on
Mercurial release day. I can tell you today that we have a handful of
extensions that are broken in Mercurial 3.2, due for release around
November 1. (Hopefully we'll fix them before release.)</p>
<p>We have Vagrant configurations so you can start a virtual machine that
runs the tests the same way Jenkins does.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the test harness is the ability to spin up Docker
containers as part of tests. Right now, this is limited to running
Bugzilla during tests. But I imagine the scope will only increase over
time.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I want to quickly explain how amazing Mercurial's
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests#Writing_a_shell_script_test">.t tests</a>
are. These are a flavor of tests used by Mercurial and the dominant form
of new tests added to the version-control-tools repository. These tests
are glorified shell scripts annotated with expected
command output and other metadata. It might be easier to explain by
showing. Take
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t">bzpost's tests</a>
as an example. The bzpost extension automatically posts commit URLs to
Bugzilla during push.
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2014/06/30/update-bugzilla-automatically-on-push/">Read more</a>
if you are interested. What I like so much about .t tests is that they
are actually testing the user experience. The test
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l69">actually runs hg push</a>
and verifies the output is exactly what is intended. Furthermore,
since we're running a Dockerized Bugzilla server during the test, we're
able to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l108">verify</a>
that the bzpost extension actually resulted in Bugzilla comments being
added to the appropriate bug(s). Contrast this with unit tests that only
test a subset of functionality. Or, contrast with writing a lot of
boilerplate and often hard-to-read code that invokes processes and uses
regular expressions, etc to compare output. I find .t tests are more
concise and they do a better job of testing user experience. More than
once I've written a .t test and thought <em>this user experience doesn't
feel right, I should change the behavior to be more user friendly</em>. This
happened because I was writing actual end-user commands as part of
writing tests and seeing the exact output the user would see. It is
much harder to attain this sense of understanding when writing unit
tests. I can name a few projects with poor command line interfaces that
could benefit from this approach... I'm not saying .t tests are perfect
or that they should replace other testing methodologies such as unit
tests. I just think they are very useful for accurately testing
higher-level functionality and for assessing user experience. I really
wish we had these tests for mach commands...</p>
<p>Anyway, with a proper testing harness in place for our version control code,
we've been pretty good about ensuring new code is properly tested. When
people submit new hooks or patches to existing hooks, we can push back and
refuse to grant review unless tests are included. When someone requests a
new deployment to the server, we can look at what changed, cross-reference
to test coverage, and assess the riskiness of the deployment. We're getting
to the point where we just trust our tests and server deployments are minor
events. Concerns over accidental regressions due to server changes are
waning. We can tell people <em>if you really care about this not breaking,
you need a test</em> and <em>if you add a test, we'll support it for you.</em>
People are often more than happy to write tests to ensure them peace of
mind, especially when that test's presence shifts maintenance
responsibility away from them. We're happy because we don't have many
surprises (and fire drills) at deployment time. It's a win-win!</p>
<p>So, what's next? Good question! We still have a number of large gaps in
our test coverage. Our code to synchronize repositories from the master
server to read-only slaves is likely the most critical omission. We also
don't yet have a good way of reproducing our server environment.
Ideally, we'd run the continuous integration in an environment that's
very similar to production. Same package versions and everything. This
would also allow us to simulate the actual hg.mozilla.org server
topology during tests. Currently, our tests are more unit-style than
integration-style. We rely on the consistent behavior of Mercurial and
other tools as sufficient proxies for test accuracy and we back those up
with running the tests on the staging server before production
deployment. But these aren't a substitute for an accurate reproduction
of the production servers, especially when it comes to things like the
replication tests. We'll get there some day. I also have plans to
improve Mercurial's test harness to better facilitate some of our
advanced use cases. I would absolutely love to make Mercurial's .t test
harness more consumable outside the context of Mercurial.
(<a href="https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram">cram</a> is one such attempt at this.)
We also need to incorporate the Git server code into this repository.
Currently, I'm pretty sure everything Git at Mozilla is untested.
Challenge accepted!</p>
<p>In summary, our story for testing version control at Mozilla has gone
from a cobbled together mess to something cohesive and comprehensive.
This has given us confidence to move fast without breaking things. I think
the weeks of people time invested into improving the state of testing
was well spent and will pay enormous dividends going forward. Looking
back, the mountain of technical debt now looks like a mole hill. I feel
good knowing that I played a part in making this change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Mozilla Mercurial Statistics</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently gained SSH access to Mozilla's Mercurial servers. This allows
me to run some custom queries directly against the data. I was
interested in some high-level numbers and thought I'd share the results.</p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org hosts a total of 3,445 repositories. Of these, there are
1,223 distinct root commits (i.e. distinct graphs). Altogether, there
are 32,123,211 commits. Of those, there are 865,594 distinct commits (not
double counting commits that appear in multiple repositories).</p>
<p>We have a high ratio of total commits to distinct commits (about 37:1).
This means we have high duplication of data on disk. This basically
means a lot of repos are clones/forks of existing ones. No big surprise
there.</p>
<p>What is surprising to me is the low number of total distinct commits. I
was expecting the number to run into the millions. (Firefox itself
accounts for ~240,000 commits.) Perhaps a lot of the data is sitting in
Git, Bitbucket, and GitHub. Sounds like a good data mining expedition...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>On Monolithic Repositories</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When companies or organizations deploy version control, they have to
make many choices. One of them is how many repositories to create.
Your choices are essentially a) a single, monolithic repository that
holds everything b) many separate, smaller repositories that hold
all the individual parts c) something in between.</p>
<p>The prevailing convention today (especially in the open source
realm) is to create many separate and loosely coupled repositories,
each repository mapping to a specific product or service. That does
seem reasonable: if you were organizing files on your filesystem,
you would group them by functionality or role (photos, music,
documents, etc). And, version control tools are functionally
filesystems. So it makes sense to draw repository boundaries at
directory/role levels.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the separate repository convention is the
scaling behavior of our version control tools. Git, the popular
tool in open source these days, doesn't scale well to very large
repositories due to - among other things - not having narrow clones
(fetching a subset of files). It scales well enough to the
overwhelming majority of projects. But if you are a large
organization generating lots of data (read: gigabytes of data over
hundreds of thousands of files and commits) for version control,
Git is unsuitable in its current form. Other tools (like Mercurial)
don't currently fare that much better (although Mercurial has plans
to tackle these scaling vectors).</p>
<p>Despite popular convention and even limitations in tools, companies
like Google and Facebook opt to run large, monolithic repositories.
Google runs Perforce.
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook is on Mercurial</a>,
or at least is in the process of migrating to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Why do these companies run monolithic repositories?
In <a href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Google's words</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have a single large depot with almost all of Google's projects
on it. This aids agile development and is much loved by our users,
since it allows almost anyone to easily view almost any code, allows
projects to share code, and allows engineers to move freely from
project to project. Documentation and data is stored on the server
as well as code.</em></p>
<p>So, monolithic repositories are all about moving fast and getting things
done more efficiently. In other words, <strong>monolithic repositories
increase developer productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, monolithic repositories are also more compatible with
the ebb and flow of large organizations and large software projects.
Components, features, products, and teams come and go, merge and split.
The only constant is change. And if you are maintaining separate
repositories that attempt to map to this ever-changing organizational
topology, you are going to have a bad time. Either you'll be
constantly copying, moving, merging, splitting, etc data and repositories.
Or your repositories will be organized in a very non-logical and
non-intuitive manner. That translates to overhead and lost productivity.
I think that monolithic repositories handle the realities of large
organizations much better. Big change or reorganization you want
to reflect? You can make a single, atomic, history-preserving commit
to move things around. I think that's much more manageable, especially
when you consider the difficulty and annoyance of history-preserving
changes across repositories.</p>
<p>Naysayers will decry monolithic repositories on principled and practical
grounds.</p>
<p>The principled camp will say that separate repositories
constitute a loosely coupled (dare I say service oriented) architecture
that maps better to how software is consumed, assembled, and deployed
and that erecting barriers in the form of separate repositories
deliberately enforces this architecture. I agree. However, you can
still maintain a loosely coupled architecture with monolithic
repositories. The Subversion model of checking out a single tree
<em>from a larger repository</em> proves this. Furthermore, I would say
architecture decisions should be enforced by people (via code review,
etc), not via version control repository topology. I believe this
principled argument against monolithic repositories to be rather weak.</p>
<p>The principled camp living in the open source realm may also decry
monolithic repositories as an affront to the spirit of open source.
They would say that a monolithic repository creates unfairly strong
ties to the organization that operates it and creates barriers to
forking, etc. This may be true. But monolithic repositories don't
intrinsically infringe on the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">basic software freedoms</a>,
organizations do. Therefore, I find this principled argument rather
weak.</p>
<p>The practical camp will say that monolithic repositories just don't
scale or aren't suitable for general audiences. These concerns are
real.</p>
<p><em>Fully</em> distributed version control systems (every commit on every
machine) definitely don't scale past certain limits. Depending on your
repository and user base, your scaling limits include disk space
(repository data terabytes in size), bandwidth (repository data terabytes
in size), filesystem (repository hundreds of thousands or millions of
files), CPU and memory (operations on large repositories take too
many system resources), and many heads/branches (tools like Git and
Mercurial don't scale well to tens of thousands of heads/branches).
These limitations with fully distributed version
control are why distributed version control tools like Git and
Mercurial support a partially-distributed mode that behaves more like
your classical server-client model, like those employed by Subversion,
Perforce, etc. Git supports shallow clone and sparse checkout.
Mercurial supports shallow clone (via remotefilelog) and has planned
support for narrow clone and sparse checkout in the next release or
two. Of course, you can avoid the scaling limitations of distributed
version control by employing a non-distributed tool, such as Subversion.
Many companies continue to reach this conclusion today. However,
users adapted to the distributed workflow would likely be
up in arms (they would probably use tools like hg-subversion or git-svn
to maintain their workflows). So, while scaling of version control
can be a real concern, there are solutions and workarounds. However,
they do involve falling back to a partially-distributed model.</p>
<p>Another concern with monolithic repositories is user access control. You
inevitably have code or data that is more sensitive and want to limit
who can change or even access it. Separate repositories seem to
facilitate a simpler model: per-repository access control. With
monolithic repositories, you have to worry about per-directory/subtree
permissions, an increased risk of data leaking, etc. This concern is
more real with distributed version control, as distributed data and
access control aren't naturally compatible. But these issues can be
resolved. And if the tooling supports it, there is only a semantic
difference between managing access control between repositories versus
components of a single repository.</p>
<p>When it comes to repository hosting conversions, I agree with Google
and Facebook: <strong>I prefer monolithic repositories</strong>. When I am interacting
with version control, I just want to get stuff done. I don't want to
waste time dealing with multiple commands to manage multiple
repositories. I don't want to waste time or expend cognitive load
dealing with submodule, subrepository, or big files management. I
don't want to waste time trying to find and reuse code, data, or
documentation. I want everything at my fingertips, where it can be
easily discovered, inspected, and used. Monolithic repositories
facilitate these workflows more than separate repositories and make
me more productive as a result.</p>
<p>Now, if only all the tools and processes we use and love would work
with monolithic repositories...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Reproducing Mozilla's Mercurial Server</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of of my first tasks in my
<a href="/blog/2014/09/05/new-job-role/">new role</a> as a <em>Developer Productivity
Engineer</em> is to help make Mozilla's Mercurial server better. Many of the
awesome things we have planned rely on features in newer versions of
Mercurial. It's therefore important for us to upgrade our Mercurial
server to a modern version (we are currently running 2.5.4) and to keep
our Mercurial server upgraded as time passes.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why we haven't historically upgraded our
Mercurial server. First, as anyone who has maintained high-availability
systems will tell you, there is the attitude of <em>if it isn't broken,
don't fix it.</em> In other words, Mercurial 2.5.4 is working fine, so why
mess with a good thing. This was all fine and dandy - until Mercurial
started falling over in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>But the blocker towards upgrading that I want to talk about today is
systems verification. There has been extreme caution around upgrading
Mercurial at Mozilla because it is a critical piece of Mozilla's
infrastructure and if the upgrade were to not go well, the outage
would be disastrous for developer productivity and could even jeopardize
an emergency Firefox release.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like to say that a modern version of Mercurial on the
server would be a drop-in replacement (Mercurial has a great committment
to backwards compatibility and has loose coupling between clients and
servers such that upgrading servers should not impact clients), there is
always a risk that something will change. And that risk is compounded by
the amount of custom code we have running on our server.</p>
<p>The way you protect against unexpected changes is testing. In the ideal
world, you have a robust test suite that you run against a staging
instance of a service to validate that any changes have no impact. In
the absence of testing, you are left with fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
FUD is an especially horrible philosophy when it comes to managing
servers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have a great testing infrastructure for
Mozilla's Mercurial server. And I want to change that.</p>
<h2>Reproducing the Server Environment</h2>
<p>When writing tests, it is important for the thing being tested to be as
similar as possible to the real thing. This is why so many people have
an aversion to mocking: every time you alter the test environment, you run
the risk that those differences from reality will mask changes seen in
the real environment.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that a good first goal for creating a test suite against
our Mercurial server should be to reproduce the production server and
environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a Vagrant environment that attempts to
reproduce the official environment as closely as possible. It starts
one virtual machine for the SSH/master server. It starts a separate
virtual machine for the hgweb/slave servers. The virtual machines are
booting CentOS. This is different than production, where we run RHEL.
But they are similar enough (and can share the same packages) that the
differences shouldn't matter too much, at least for now.</p>
<h2>Using Puppet</h2>
<p>In production, Mozilla is using Puppet to manage the Mercurial servers.
Unfortunately, the actual Puppet configs that Mozilla is running are
behind a firewall, mainly for security reasons. This is potentially
a huge setback for my reproducibility effort, as I'd like to have
my virtual machines use the same exact Puppet configs as whats used
in production so the environments match as closely as possible. This
would also save me a lot of work from having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ben Kero has extracted the Mercurial-relevant Puppet
config files into a
<a href="https://github.com/bkero/puppet-module-hg">standalone repository</a>.
Apparently that repository gets rolled into the production Puppet
configs periodically. So, my virtual machines and production can share
the same Mercurial Puppet files. Nice!</p>
<p>It wasn't long after starting to use the standalone Puppet configs that
I realized this would be a rabbit hole. This first manifests in the
standalone Puppet code referencing things that exist in the hidden
Mozilla Puppet files. So the liberation was only partially successful.
Sad panda.</p>
<p>So, I'm now in the process of creating a <em>fake Mozilla</em> Puppet
environment that mimics the base Mozilla environment (from the closed
repo) and am modifying the shared Puppet Mercurial code to work with
both versions. This is a royal pain, but it needs to be done if we want
to reproduce production and maintain peace of mind that test results
reflect reality.</p>
<p>Because reproducing runtime environments is important for reproducing
and solving bugs and for testing, <strong>I call on the maintainers of
Mozilla's closed Puppet repository to liberate it from behind its
firewall</strong>. I'd like to see a public Puppet configuration tree available
for all to use so that anyone anywhere can reproduce the state of a
server or service operated by Mozilla to within reasonable
approximation. Had this already been done, it would have saved me hours
of work. As it stands, I'm reverse engineering systems and trying to
cobble together understanding of how the Mozilla Puppet configs
work and what parts of them can safely be ignored to reproduce an
approximate testing environment.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I finally got access to Mozilla's internal Puppet
repository. This took a few meetings and apparently a lot of
backroom chatter was generated - "developer's don't normally get access,
oh my!" All I wanted was to see how systems are configured so I can
help improve them. Instead, getting access felt like pulling teeth.
This feels like a major roadblock towards productivity, reproducibility,
and testing.</p>
<p>Facebook gives its developers access to most production machines and
trusts them to not be stupid. I know we (Mozilla) like to hold
ourselves to a high standard of security and privacy. But not giving
developers access to the configurations for the systems their code
runs on feels like a very silly policy. I hope Mozilla invests in
opening up this important code and data, if not to the world, at least
to its trusted employees.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully I'll soon have a Vagrant environment that allows
people to build a standalone instance of Mozilla's Mercurial server.
And once that's in place, I can start writing tests that basic services
and workflows (including repository syncing) work as expected. Stay
tuned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Mercurial hooks move and testing Mercurial</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mozilla has a number of source repositories under
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/">https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/</a>
that cumulatively define how version control works at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Back in February, I
<a href="/blog/2014/02/05/new-repository-for-mozilla-version-control-tools/">launched an effort</a>
to establish a unified Mercurial repository for all this code. That
repository is <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
and it has slowly grown.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052201">latest addition</a>
to this repository is the import of the <em>hghooks</em> repository. This
now-defunct repository contained all the server-side Mercurial hooks
that Mozilla has deployed on <em>hg.mozilla.org</em>.</p>
<p>Soon after that repository was imported into version-control-tools, we
started executing the hooks tests as part of the existing test suite in
version-control-tools. This means we get
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/">continuous integration</a>,
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/coveragepy/?">code coverage</a>,
and the ability to run tests against multiple versions of Mercurial
(2.5.4 through 3.1) in one go.</p>
<p><strong>This is new for Mozilla and is a big deal.</strong> For the first time, we
have a somewhat robust testing environment for Mercurial that is testing
things we run in production.</p>
<p>But we still have a long way to go. The ultimate goal is to get everything
rolled into the version-control-tools repository and to write tests for
everything people rely on. We also want the test environment to look as
much like our production environment as possible. Once that's in place,
most of the fear and uncertainty around upgrading or changing the server
goes away. This will allow Mozilla to move faster and issues like our
recent server problems can be diagnosed more quickly (Mercurial has
added better logging in newer versions).</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to this effort, <strong>please write tests for
behavior you rely on.</strong> We're now relying on Mercurial's test harness
and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests">test types</a>
rather than low-level unit tests. This means our tests are now running
a Mercurial server and running actual Mercurial commands. The tests thus
explicitly verify that client-seen behavior is exactly as you intend.
For an example, see the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/abc1c5bdca9b/hghooks/tests/test-prevent-webidl.t">WebIDL hook test</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Find some gaps in code coverage and write
some tests today!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Please run mach mercurial-setup</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there, Firefox developer! Do you use Mercurial? Please take the time
right now to run <strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> from your Firefox clone.</p>
<p>It's been updated to ensure you are running a modern Mercurial version.
More awesomely, it has support for a couple of new extensions to make
you more productive. I think you'll like what you see.</p>
<p><strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> doesn't change your <em>hgrc</em> without
confirmation. So it is safe to run to see what's available. You should
consider running it periodically, say once a week or so. I wouldn't
be surprised if we add a notification to mach to remind you to do this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Repository-Centric Development</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was editing a wiki page yesterday and I think I coined a new term
which I'd like to enter the common nomenclature: <em>repository-centric
development</em>. The term refers to development/version control
workflows that place repositories - not patches - first.</p>
<p>When collaborating on version controlled code with modern tools like
Git and Mercurial, you essentially have two choices on how to
share version control data: patches or repositories.</p>
<p>Patches have been around since the dawn of version control. Everyone
knows how they work: your version control system has a copy of
the canonical data and it can export a view of a specific change
into what's called a patch. A patch is essentially a diff with
extra metadata.</p>
<p>When distributed version control systems came along, they brought
with them an alternative to patch-centric development:
repository-centric development. You could still exchange patches if you
wanted, but distributed version control allowed you to <em>pull</em> changes
directly from multiple <em>repositories</em>. You weren't limited to a single
master server (that's what the <em>distributed</em> in <em>distributed version
control</em> means). You also didn't have to go through an intermediate
transport such as email to exchange patches: you communicate directly
with a peer repository instance.</p>
<p>Repository-centric development eliminates the <em>middle man</em> required
for patch exchange: instead of exchanging derived data, you exchange
the actual data, speaking the repository's native language.</p>
<p>One advantage of repository-centric development is it eliminates the
problem of patch non-uniformity. Patches come in many different flavors.
You have plain diffs. You have diffs with metadata. You have Git style
metadata. You have Mercurial style metadata. You can produce patches
with various lines of context in the diff. There are different methods
for handling binary content. There are different ways to express
file adds, removals, and renames. It's all a hot mess. Any system
that consumes patches needs to deal with the non-uniformity. Do you
think this isn't a problem in the real world? Think again. If you are
involved with an open source project that collects patches via email
or by uploading patches to a bug tracker, have you ever seen someone
accidentally upload a patch in the wrong format? That's patch
non-uniformity. New contributors to Firefox do this all the time. I
also see it in the Mercurial project. With repository-centric
development, patches never enter the picture, so patch non-uniformity
is a non-issue. (Don't confuse the superficial formatting of patches
with the content, such as an incorrect commit message format.)</p>
<p>Another advantage of repository-centric development is it makes the
act of exchanging data easier. Just have two repositories talk to
each other. This used to be difficult, but hosting services like
GitHub and Bitbucket make this easy. Contrast with patches, which
require hooking your version control tool up to wherever those patches
are located. The Linux Kernel, like so many other projects,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">uses email for contributing changes</a>.
So now Git, Mercurial, etc all fulfill Zawinski's law. This means your
version control tool is talking to your inbox to send and receive code.
Firefox development uses Bugzilla to hold patches as attachments. So now your
version control tool needs to talk to your issue tracker. (Not the worst
idea in the world I will concede.) While, yes, the tools around using
email or uploading patches to issue trackers or whatever else you are
using to exchange patches exist and can work pretty well, the grim
reality is that these tools are all reinventing the wheel of repository
exchange and are solving a problem that has already been solved by
<em>git push</em>, <em>git fetch</em>, <em>hg pull</em>, <em>hg push</em>, etc. Personally, I would
rather <em>hg push</em> to a remote and have tools like issue trackers and
mailing lists pull directly from repositories. At least that way they
have a direct line into the source of truth and are guaranteed a
consistent output format.</p>
<p>Another area where direct exchange is huge is multi-patch commits
(<em>branches</em> in Git parlance) or where commit data is fragmented. When
pushing patches to email, you need to insert metadata saying which patch
comes after which. Then the email import tool needs to reassemble things
in the proper order (remember that the typical convention is one email
per patch and email can be delivered out of order). Not the most
difficult problem in the world to solve. But seriously, it's been
solved already by <em>git fetch</em> and <em>hg pull</em>! Things are worse for
Bugzilla. There is no bullet-proof way to order patches there. The
convention at Mozilla is to add <em>Part N</em> strings to
commit messages and have the Bugzilla import tool do a sort (I assume it
does that). But what if you have a logical commit series spread across
multiple bugs? How do you reassemble everything into a linear series of
commits? You don't, sadly. Just today I wanted to apply a somewhat
complicated series of patches to the Firefox build system I was asked to
review so I could jump into a debugger and see what was going on so I
could conduct a more thorough review. There were 4 or 5 patches spread
over 3 or 4 bugs. Bugzilla and its patch-centric workflow prevented me
from importing the patches. Fortunately, this patch series was pushed to
Mozilla's Try server, so I could pull from there. But I haven't always
been so fortunate. This limitation means developers have to make
sacrifices such as writing fewer, larger patches (this makes code review
harder) or involving unrelated parties in the same bug and/or review.
In other words, deficient tools are imposing limited workflows. No bueno.</p>
<p>It is a fair criticism to say that not everyone can host a server or
that permissions and authorization are hard. Although I think concerns
about impact are overblown. If you are a small project, just create a
GitHub or Bitbucket account. If you are a larger project, realize that
people time is one of your largest expenses and invest in tools like
proper and efficient repository hosting (often this can be GitHub) to
reduce this waste and keep your developers happier and more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the clearest examples of repository-centric development is
GitHub. There are no patches in GitHub. Instead, you <em>git push</em>
and <em>git fetch</em>. Want to apply someone else's work? Just add a remote
and <em>git fetch</em>! Contrast with first locating patches, hooking up
Git to consume them (this part was always confusing to me - do you
need to retroactively have them sent to your email inbox so you can
import them from there), and finally actually importing them. Just
give me a URL to a repository already. But the benefits of
repository-centric development with GitHub don't stop at pushing and
pulling. GitHub has built code review functionality into pushes. They
call these <em>pull requests</em>. While I have significant issues with
GitHub's implemention of pull requests (I need to blog about those some
day), I can't deny the utility of the repository-centric workflow and
all the benefits around it. Once you switch to GitHub and its
repository-centric workflow, you more clearly see how lacking
patch-centric development is and quickly lose your desire to go back
to the 1990's state-of-the-art methods for software development.</p>
<p>I hope you now know what repository-centric development is and will join
me in championing it over patch-based development.</p>
<p>Mozillians reading this will be very happy to learn that work is under
way to shift Firefox's development workflow to a more repository-centric
world. Stay tuned.</p>]]></content:encoded>
