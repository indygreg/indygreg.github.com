  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>It's been a <a href="/blog/2015/03/18/network-events/">rough week</a>.</p>
<p>The very short summary of events this week is that
Firefox's release automation has been performing a
denial of service attack against
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is nothing new. The Firefox release automation
is by far the top consumer of hg.mozilla.org data, requesting several
terabytes per day via several million HTTP requests from thousands of
machines in multiple data centers. The very nature of their existence
makes them a significant denial of service threat.</p>
<p>Lots of things went wrong this week. While a post mortem will shed
light on them, many fall under the umbrella of <em>Firefox release
automation was making more requests than it should have and was doing
so in a way that increased the chances of a prolonged service outage.</em>
This resulted in the hg.mozilla.org servers working harder than they
ever have. As a result, we have some new <em>high scores</em> to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On UTC day March 19, hg.mozilla.org transferred 7.4 TiB of data.
  This is a significant increase from the ~4 TiB we expect on a typical
  weekday. (Even more significant when you consider that most load is
  generated during peak hours.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 1300 UTC hour of March 17, the cluster received 1,363,628
  HTTP requests. No HTTP 503 Service Not Available errors were
  encountered in that window! 300,000 to 400,000 requests per hour is
  typical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 0800 UTC hour of March 19, the cluster transferred 776 GiB
  of repository data. That comes out to at least 1.725 Gbps on average
  (I didn't calculate TCP and other overhead). Anything greater than 250
  GiB per hour is not very common. No HTTP 503 errors were served from
  the origin servers during this hour!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encountered many periods where hg.mozilla.org was operating more than
twice its normal and expected operating capacity and it was able to
handle the load just fine. As a server operator, I'm proud of this.
The servers were provisioned beyond what is normally needed of them and
it took a truly exceptional event (or two) to bring the service down.
This is generally a good way to do hosted services (you rarely want to be
barely provisioned because you fall over at the slighest change and you
don't want to be grossly over-provisioned because you are wasting money
on idle resources).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hg.mozilla.org service did fall over. Multiple times,
in fact. There is room to improve. As proud as I am that the service
operated well beyond its expected limits, I can't help but feel ashamed
that it did eventual cave in under even extreme load and that people are
probably making mis-informed general assumptions like <em>Mercurial can't
scale</em>. The simple fact of the matter is that clients cumulatively
generated an exceptional amount of traffic to hg.mozilla.org this week.
All servers have capacity limits. And this week we encountered the limit
for the current configuration of hg.mozilla.org. Cause and effect.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mozilla has historically done some funky things with the Firefox
Mercurial repositories. One of the things we've done is create
a bunch of named branches to track the Firefox release process.
These are branch names like <em>GECKO20b12_2011022218_RELBRANCH</em>.</p>
<p>Over in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927219">bug 927219</a>,
we started the process of cleaning up some cruft left over from
many of these old branches.</p>
<p>For starters, the old named branches in the Firefox repositories
are being actively closed. When you <em>hg commit --close-branch</em>,
Mercurial creates a special commit that says <em>this branch is closed</em>.
Branches that are closed are automatically hidden from the output
of <em>hg branches</em> and <em>hg heads</em>. As a result, the output of these
commands is now much more usable.</p>
<p>Closed branches still constitute <em>heads</em> on the DAG. And several heads
lead to degraded performance in some situations (notably push and pull
times - the same thing happens in Git). I'd like to eventually merge
these old heads so that repositories only have 1 or a small number of
DAG heads. However, extra care must be taken before that step. Stay
tuned.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the average person reading, you probably won't be impacted
by these changes at all. The greatest impact will be from the person who
lands the first change on top of any repository whose last commit
was a branch close. If you commit on top of the <em>tip</em> commit,
you'll be committing on top of a previously closed branch! You'll
instead want to <em>hg up default</em> after you pull to ensure you are on
the proper DAG head! And even then, if you have local commits, you may
not be based on top of the appropriate commit! A simple run of
<em>hg log --graph</em> should help you decipther the state of the world.
(Please note that the usability problems around discovering the
appropriate head to land on are a result of our poor branching strategy
for the Firefox repositories. We probably should have named branches
tracking the active Gecko releases. But that ship sailed years ago
and fixing that is pretty far down the priority list. Wallpapering
over things with the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/firefoxtree.html">firefoxtree extensions</a>
is my recommended solution until matters are fixed.)</p>

  <p>Mozilla's Mercurial documentation has historically been pretty bad. The
documentation on MDN (which I refuse to link to) is horribly disjointed
and contains a lot of outdated recommendations. I've made attempts to
burn some of it to the ground, but it is just too overwhelming.</p>
<p>I've been casually creating my own Mercurial documentation tailored for
Mozillians. It's called
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/index.html">Mercurial for Mozillians</a>.</p>
<p>It started as a way to document extensions inside the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository. But, it has since evolved to cover other topics, like how to
install Mercurial, how to develop using bookmarks, and how to interact
with a unified Firefox repository. The documentation is nowhere near
complete. But it already has some very useful content beyond what MDN
offers.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy about the idea of having generic Mercurial documentation
on a Mozilla domain (this should be part of the official Mercurial
documentation). Nor am I crazy about moving content off MDN. I'm sure
content will move to its appropriate location later. Until then,
enjoy some curated Mercurial documentation!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The <em>bzexport</em> Mercurial extension - an extension that enables you to
easily create new Bugzilla bugs and upload patches to Bugzilla for
review - just received some
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1033394">major updates</a>.</p>
<p>First, we now have automated test coverage of bzexport! This is built on
top of the version control test harness I
<a href="/blog/2014/10/14/robustly-testing-version-control-at-mozilla/">previously blogged about</a>.
As part of the tests, we start Docker containers that run the same code
that's running on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>,
so interactions with Bugzilla are properly tested. This is much, much
better than mocking HTTP requests and responses because if Bugzilla
changes, our tests will detect it. Yay continuous integration.</p>
<p>Second, bzexport now uses Bugzilla' REST API instead of the legacy bzAPI
endpoint for all but 1 HTTP request. This should make BMO maintainers
very happy.</p>
<p>Third and finally, bzexport now uses shared code for obtaining Bugzilla
credentials. The behavior is
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/auth.html">documented</a>,
of course. Behavior is <strong>not backwards compatible</strong>. If you were using some
old configuration values, you will now see warnings when running bzexport.
These warnings are actionable, so I shouldn't need to describe them
here.</p>
<p>Please obtain the new code by pulling the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository. Or, if you have a Firefox clone, run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>.</p>
<p>If you find any regressions, file a bug in the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20bzexport">Developers Services :: Mercurial: bzexport</a>
component and have it depend on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1033394">bug 1033394</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to Steve Fink, Ed Morley, and Ted Mielczarek for looking
at the code.</p>

  <p>Starting today and continuing through next week, there will be a number
of styling changes made to <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the work is to bring the style up-to-date with upstream
Mercurial. This will result in more features being available to the web
interface, hopefully making it more useful. This includes display of
bookmarks and the Mercurial help documentation. As part of this work,
we're also removing some files on the server that shouldn't be used. If
you start getting 404s or notice an unexpected theme change, this is
probably the reason why.</p>
<p>If you'd like to look over the changes before they are made or would
like to file a bug against a regression (we suspect there will be
minor regressions due to the large nature of the changes), head on
over to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1117021">bug 1117021</a>
or ping people in #vcs on IRC.</p>
