  <p>Hey there, Firefox developer! Do you use Mercurial? Please take the time
right now to run <strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> from your Firefox clone.</p>
<p>It's been updated to ensure you are running a modern Mercurial version.
More awesomely, it has support for a couple of new extensions to make
you more productive. I think you'll like what you see.</p>
<p><strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> doesn't change your <em>hgrc</em> without
confirmation. So it is safe to run to see what's available. You should
consider running it periodically, say once a week or so. I wouldn't
be surprised if we add a notification to mach to remind you to do this.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I was editing a wiki page yesterday and I think I coined a new term
which I'd like to enter the common nomenclature: <em>repository-centric
development</em>. The term refers to development/version control
workflows that place repositories - not patches - first.</p>
<p>When collaborating on version controlled code with modern tools like
Git and Mercurial, you essentially have two choices on how to
share version control data: patches or repositories.</p>
<p>Patches have been around since the dawn of version control. Everyone
knows how they work: your version control system has a copy of
the canonical data and it can export a view of a specific change
into what's called a patch. A patch is essentially a diff with
extra metadata.</p>
<p>When distributed version control systems came along, they brought
with them an alternative to patch-centric development:
repository-centric development. You could still exchange patches if you
wanted, but distributed version control allowed you to <em>pull</em> changes
directly from multiple <em>repositories</em>. You weren't limited to a single
master server (that's what the <em>distributed</em> in <em>distributed version
control</em> means). You also didn't have to go through an intermediate
transport such as email to exchange patches: you communicate directly
with a peer repository instance.</p>
<p>Repository-centric development eliminates the <em>middle man</em> required
for patch exchange: instead of exchanging derived data, you exchange
the actual data, speaking the repository's native language.</p>
<p>One advantage of repository-centric development is it eliminates the
problem of patch non-uniformity. Patches come in many different flavors.
You have plain diffs. You have diffs with metadata. You have Git style
metadata. You have Mercurial style metadata. You can produce patches
with various lines of context in the diff. There are different methods
for handling binary content. There are different ways to express
file adds, removals, and renames. It's all a hot mess. Any system
that consumes patches needs to deal with the non-uniformity. Do you
think this isn't a problem in the real world? Think again. If you are
involved with an open source project that collects patches via email
or by uploading patches to a bug tracker, have you ever seen someone
accidentally upload a patch in the wrong format? That's patch
non-uniformity. New contributors to Firefox do this all the time. I
also see it in the Mercurial project. With repository-centric
development, patches never enter the picture, so patch non-uniformity
is a non-issue. (Don't confuse the superficial formatting of patches
with the content, such as an incorrect commit message format.)</p>
<p>Another advantage of repository-centric development is it makes the
act of exchanging data easier. Just have two repositories talk to
each other. This used to be difficult, but hosting services like
GitHub and Bitbucket make this easy. Contrast with patches, which
require hooking your version control tool up to wherever those patches
are located. The Linux Kernel, like so many other projects,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">uses email for contributing changes</a>.
So now Git, Mercurial, etc all fulfill Zawinski's law. This means your
version control tool is talking to your inbox to send and receive code.
Firefox development uses Bugzilla to hold patches as attachments. So now your
version control tool needs to talk to your issue tracker. (Not the worst
idea in the world I will concede.) While, yes, the tools around using
email or uploading patches to issue trackers or whatever else you are
using to exchange patches exist and can work pretty well, the grim
reality is that these tools are all reinventing the wheel of repository
exchange and are solving a problem that has already been solved by
<em>git push</em>, <em>git fetch</em>, <em>hg pull</em>, <em>hg push</em>, etc. Personally, I would
rather <em>hg push</em> to a remote and have tools like issue trackers and
mailing lists pull directly from repositories. At least that way they
have a direct line into the source of truth and are guaranteed a
consistent output format.</p>
<p>Another area where direct exchange is huge is multi-patch commits
(<em>branches</em> in Git parlance) or where commit data is fragmented. When
pushing patches to email, you need to insert metadata saying which patch
comes after which. Then the email import tool needs to reassemble things
in the proper order (remember that the typical convention is one email
per patch and email can be delivered out of order). Not the most
difficult problem in the world to solve. But seriously, it's been
solved already by <em>git fetch</em> and <em>hg pull</em>! Things are worse for
Bugzilla. There is no bullet-proof way to order patches there. The
convention at Mozilla is to add <em>Part N</em> strings to
commit messages and have the Bugzilla import tool do a sort (I assume it
does that). But what if you have a logical commit series spread across
multiple bugs? How do you reassemble everything into a linear series of
commits? You don't, sadly. Just today I wanted to apply a somewhat
complicated series of patches to the Firefox build system I was asked to
review so I could jump into a debugger and see what was going on so I
could conduct a more thorough review. There were 4 or 5 patches spread
over 3 or 4 bugs. Bugzilla and its patch-centric workflow prevented me
from importing the patches. Fortunately, this patch series was pushed to
Mozilla's Try server, so I could pull from there. But I haven't always
been so fortunate. This limitation means developers have to make
sacrifices such as writing fewer, larger patches (this makes code review
harder) or involving unrelated parties in the same bug and/or review.
In other words, deficient tools are imposing limited workflows. No bueno.</p>
<p>It is a fair criticism to say that not everyone can host a server or
that permissions and authorization are hard. Although I think concerns
about impact are overblown. If you are a small project, just create a
GitHub or Bitbucket account. If you are a larger project, realize that
people time is one of your largest expenses and invest in tools like
proper and efficient repository hosting (often this can be GitHub) to
reduce this waste and keep your developers happier and more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the clearest examples of repository-centric development is
GitHub. There are no patches in GitHub. Instead, you <em>git push</em>
and <em>git fetch</em>. Want to apply someone else's work? Just add a remote
and <em>git fetch</em>! Contrast with first locating patches, hooking up
Git to consume them (this part was always confusing to me - do you
need to retroactively have them sent to your email inbox so you can
import them from there), and finally actually importing them. Just
give me a URL to a repository already. But the benefits of
repository-centric development with GitHub don't stop at pushing and
pulling. GitHub has built code review functionality into pushes. They
call these <em>pull requests</em>. While I have significant issues with
GitHub's implemention of pull requests (I need to blog about those some
day), I can't deny the utility of the repository-centric workflow and
all the benefits around it. Once you switch to GitHub and its
repository-centric workflow, you more clearly see how lacking
patch-centric development is and quickly lose your desire to go back
to the 1990's state-of-the-art methods for software development.</p>
<p>I hope you now know what repository-centric development is and will join
me in championing it over patch-based development.</p>
<p>Mozillians reading this will be very happy to learn that work is under
way to shift Firefox's development workflow to a more repository-centric
world. Stay tuned.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>My <a href="/blog/2014/06/23/please-stop-using-mq/">Please Stop Using MQ</a> post,
has been generating a lot of interest for bookmark-based workflows at
Mozilla. To make adoption easier, I
<a href="/blog/2014/06/30/track-firefox-repositories-with-local-only-mercurial-tags/">quickly authored</a>
an <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/firefoxtree/__init__.py">extension</a>
to add <em>remote refs</em> of Firefox repositories to Mercurial.</p>
<p>There was still a bit of confusion and gripes about workflows that I
thought it would be best to update the extension to make things more
pleasant.</p>
<h2>Automatic tree names</h2>
<p>People wanted an ability to easy pull/aggregate the various Firefox
trees without additional configuration to an hgrc file.</p>
<p>With <em>firefoxtree</em>, you can now <em>hg pull central</em> or <em>hg pull inbound</em>
or <em>hg pull aurora</em> and it just works.</p>
<p>Pushing with aliases doesn't yet work. It is slightly harder to do in
the Mercurial API. I have a solution, but I'm validating some code paths
to ensure it is safe. This feature will likely appear soon.</p>
<h2>fxheads commands</h2>
<p>Once people adopted unified repositories with heads from multiple
repositories, they asked how they could quickly identify the heads of
the pulled Firefox repositories.</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> now provides a <em>hg fxheads</em> command that prints a
concise output of the commits constituting the heads of the Firefox
repos. e.g.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>hg fxheads
224969:0ec0b9ac39f0 aurora <span class="o">(</span>sort of<span class="o">)</span> bug <span class="m">898554</span> - raise expected hazard count <span class="k">for</span> b2g to <span class="m">4</span> <span class="k">until</span> they are fixed, <span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span>bustage+hazbuild-only
224290:6befadcaa685 beta Tagging /src/mdauto/build/mozilla-beta 1772e55568e4 with FIREFOX_RELEASE_31_BASE <span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span>release CLOSED TREE

</pre></div>

<p>Please note that the output is based upon local-only knowledge: you'll
need to pull to ensure data is current.</p>
<h2>Reject pushing multiple heads</h2>
<p>People were complaining that bookmark-based workflows resulted in
Mercurial trying to push multiple heads to a remote. This complaint
stems from the fact that Mercurial's default push behavior is to find
all commits missing from the remote and push them. This behavior is
extremely frustrating for Firefox development because the Firefox repos
only have a single head and pushing multiple heads will only result in
a server hook rejecting the push (after wasting a lot of time
transferring that commit data).</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> now will refuse to push multiple heads to a known Firefox
repo before any commit data is sent. In other words, we fail fast so
your time is saved.</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> also changes the default behavior of <em>hg push</em> when
pushing to a Firefox repo. If no <em>-r</em> argument is specified, <em>hg push</em>
to a Firefox repo will automatically remap to <em>hg push -r .</em>. In other
words, we attempt to push the working copy's commit by default. This
change establishes sensible default and likely working behavior when
typing just <em>hg push</em>.</p>
<p>I am a bit on the fence about changing the default behavior of <em>hg
push</em>. On one hand, it makes total sense. On the other, silently
changing the default behavior of a built-in command is a little
dangerous. I can easily see this backfiring when people interact with
non-Firefox repos. I encourage people to get in the habit of typing
<em>hg push -r <rev></em> because that's what you should be doing.</p>
<h2>Installing firefoxtree</h2>
<p>Within the next 48 hours, <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> should prompt to
install <em>firefoxtree</em>. Until then, clone
<em>https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools</em> and ensure your
<em>~/.hgrc</em> file has the following:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
firefoxtree = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/firefoxtree
</code></pre>
<p>You likely already have a copy of version-control-tools
in <em>~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools</em>.</p>
<p>It is completely safe to install <em>firefoxtree</em> globally: the extension
will only modify behavior of repositories that are clones of Firefox
repositories.</p>

  <p>Do you manually create Bugzilla comments when you push changes to a
Firefox source repository? Yeah, I do too.</p>
<p>That's always annoyed me.</p>
<p>It is screaming to be automated.</p>
<p>So I automated it.</p>
<p>You can too. From a Firefox source checkout:</p>
<p>$ ./mach mercurial-setup</p>
<p>That should clone the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository into <em>~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools</em>.</p>
<p>Then, add the following to your <em>~/.hgrc</em> file:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="k">[extensions]</span>
<span class="na">bzpost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools/hgext/bzpost</span>

<span class="k">[bugzilla]</span>
<span class="na">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">me@example.com</span>
<span class="na">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">password</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, when you <em>hg push</em> to a Firefox repository, the commit URLs will
get posted to referenced bugs automatically.</p>
<p>Please note that pushing to <em>release</em> trees such as mozilla-central is
not yet supported. In due time.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you run into any issues.</p>
<h2>Estimated Cost Savings</h2>
<p>Assuming the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It costs Mozilla $200,000 per year per full-time engineer working on
  Firefox (a general rule of thumb for non-senior positions is that your
  true employee cost is 2x your base salary).</li>
<li>Each full-time engineer works 40 hours per week for 46 weeks out of
  the year.</li>
<li>It takes 15 seconds to manually update Bugzilla for each push.</li>
<li>There are 20,000 pushes requiring Bugzilla attention per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>We arrive at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per employee per hour worked: $108.70</li>
<li>Total person-time to manually update Bugzilla: ~83 hours</li>
<li>Total cost to manually update Bugzilla after push: $9,058.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was intentionally conservative with all the inputs except time
worked (I think many of us work more than 40 hour weeks).
My estimates also don't take into account the lost productivity
associated with getting mentally derailed by interacting with Bugzilla.
With this in mind, I could very easily justify a total cost at
least 2x-3x higher.</p>
<p>It took me maybe 3 hours to crank this out. I could spend another few
weeks on it full time and Mozilla would still save money (assuming
100% adoption).</p>
<p>I encourage people to run their own cost calculations on other tasks
that can be automated. Inefficiencies multiplied by millions of dollars
(your collective employee cost) result in large piles of money. Not
having tools (even simple ones like this) is equivalent to setting
loads of cash on fire.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>After reading my recent
<a href="/blog/2014/06/23/please-stop-using-mq/">Please Stop Using MQ</a> post,
a number of people asked me about my development workflow. While I
still owe a full answer to that question, one of the cornerstores
is a unified Mercurial repository. Instead of having separate clones
for mozilla-central, mozilla-inbound, aurora, beta, etc, I have a
single clone with the changesets from all the repositories.</p>
<p>I feel having a unified repository has made me more productive. I no
longer have to waste time shuffling changesets between local clones.
This introduced all kinds of extra cognitive load and manual
processes that slowed me down. I highly encourage others to adopt
unified repositories.</p>
<p>Because the various Firefox repositories don't have unique branches
or bookmarks tracking the various heads, aggregating multiple
repositories introduces a client-side problem of identifying
which head is which. If you merely do a <em>hg pull</em>, you'll get a
bunch of anonymous heads.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you'll need to employ minor client-side
magic. Previously, I <a href="/2013/07/22/mercurial-extension-for-gecko-development/">recommended</a>
my heavyweight <em>mozext</em> extension.</p>
<p>Today, I'm proud to announce a new, lighter extension:
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/firefoxtree/__init__.py">firefoxtree</a>.
When pulling from a known Firefox repository, this extension will add
a local-only Mercurial tag for that repository. For example,
when pulling mozilla-central, the <em>central</em> tag will be created.</p>
<p>Local-only tags are a Mercurial feature only available to
extensions. A local-only tag is effectively an overlay of tags
that don't get transferred as part of push and pull operations.
They behave like normal tags: you can <em>hg up</em> to them and reference
them elsewhere changeset identifiers are used. They are also read
only: if you update to a tag and then commit, the tag will not
move forward (contrast with branches or bookmarks).</p>
<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<p>Clone <em>https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools</em> and add
the following to your <em>.hg/hgrc</em>:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
firefoxtree = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/firefoxtree
</code></pre>
<p>To use, simply pull from a Firefox repo:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>hg pull https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

<span class="nv">$ </span>hg up central

<span class="c"># Do your development work.</span>

<span class="c"># Time to land.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>hg pull https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound
<span class="nv">$ </span>hg rebase -d inbound
<span class="nv">$ </span>hg out -r . https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound
<span class="nv">$ </span>hg push -r .  https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound
</pre></div>

<p>Please note that <em>hg push</em> tries to push all local changes on all
heads to a remote by default. When operating a unified repo, you'll
need to use the <em>-r</em> argument to <em>hg push</em> and <em>hg out</em> to limit
what changesets are considered. I most frequently use <em>-r .</em> to limit
changes to the current checked out changeset.</p>
<p>Also note that this extension conflicts with my <em>mozext</em> extension.
I hope to update <em>mozext</em> to make it behave in the same manner. (It
was easier to write a new extension than to update mozext.)</p>
