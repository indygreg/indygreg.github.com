  <p>The Internet went crazy on Thursday when Google
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">announced a SHA-1 collision</a>.
This has spawned a lot of talk about the impact of SHA-1 in version
control. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Git) weighed in on the
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=148787047422954">Git mailing list</a> and on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/7tp2gYWQugL">Google+</a>.
There are also posts like
<a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2017-February/031623.html">SHA1 collisions make Git vulnerable to attakcs by third-parties, not just repo maintainers</a>
outlining the history of Git and SHA-1. On the Mercurial side,
Matt Mackall (the creator of Mercurial) authored a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">SHA-1 and Mercurial security article</a>.
(If you haven't read Matt's article, please do so now before
continuing.)</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute my own take on the problem with a slant towards
Mercurial and while also comparing Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1
collisions to Git's. Since this is a security topic, I'd like to
explicitly state that I'm not a cryptographer. However, I've worked on
a number of software components that do security/cryptography (like
Firefox Sync) and I'm pretty confident saying that my grasp on
cryptographic primitives and security techniques is better than the
average developer's.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions on a technical
level.</p>
<p>Mercurial, like Git, is <em>vulnerable</em> to SHA-1 collisions. Mercurial is
vulnerable because its logical storage mechanism (like Git's) indexes
tracked content by SHA-1. If two objects with differing content have the
same SHA-1, content under version control could be changed and detecting
that would be difficult or impossible. That's obviously bad.</p>
<p>But, Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions isn't as severe as Git's.
To understand why, we have to understand how each stores data.</p>
<p>Git's logical storage model is a content-addressable key-value store.
Values (<em>objects</em> in Git parlance) consist of a header identifying the
object type (commit, tree, blob, or tag), the size of the data (as a
string), and the raw content of the thing being stored. Common content
types are file content (blob), a list of files (tree), and a description
of a commit (commit). Keys in this blob store are SHA-1 hashes of objects.
All Git objects go into a single <em>namespace</em> in the Git repository's
<em>store</em>. A beneficial side-effect of this is data de-duplication: if the
same file is added to a Git repository, it's <em>blob</em> object will be
identical and it will only be stored once by Git. A detrimental
side-effect is that hash collisions are possible between any two objects,
irregardless of their type or location in the repository.</p>
<p>Mercurial's logical storage model is also content-addressable. However,
it is significantly different from Git's approach. Mercurial's logical
storage model allocates a separate sub-store for each tracked <em>path</em>.
If you run <code>find .hg/store -name '*.i'</code> inside a Mercurial repository,
you'll see these files. There is a separate file for each path
that has committed data. If you <code>hg add foo.txt</code> and <code>hg commit</code>, there
will be a <code>data/foo.txt.i</code> file holding data for <code>foo.txt</code>.
There are also special files <code>00changelog.i</code> and <code>00manifest.i</code> holding
data for commits/changesets and file lists, respectively. Each of these
<code>.i</code> files - a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/a185b903bda3/mercurial/help/internals/revlogs.txt">revlog</a> -
is roughly equivalent to an ordered collection of Git objects for a
specific tracked path. This means that Mercurial's store consists of
N discrete and independent namespaces for data. Contrast with Git's
single namespace.</p>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks are the opposite of those pointed out for
Git above: Mercurial doesn't have automatic content-based de-duplication
but it does provide some defense against hash collisions. Because each
logical path is independent of all others, a Mercurial repository will
happily commit two files with different content but same hashes. This
is more robust than Git because a hash collision is isolated to a single
logical path / revlog. In other words, a random file added to the
repository in directory <code>X</code> that has a hash collision with a file in
directory <code>Y</code> won't cause problems.</p>
<p>Mercurial also differs significantly from Git in terms of how the hash
is obtained. Git's hash is computed from raw content preceded by a header
derived directly from the object's role and size. (Takeaway: the header is
static and can be derived trivially.) Mercurial's hash is computed from
raw content preceded by a header. But that header consists of the 20 byte
SHA-1 hash(es) of the parent revisions in the revlog to which the content
is being added. This <em>chaining</em> of hashes means that the header is not
always static nor always trivially derived. This means that the same
content can be stored in the revlog under multiple hashes. It also means
that it is possible to store differing content having a hash collision
within the same revlog! But only under some conditions - Mercurial will
still barf in some scenarios if there is a hash collision within content
tracked by the revlog. This is different from Git's behavior, where the
same content <em>always</em> results in the same Git object hash. (It's worth
noting that a SHA-1 collision on data with a Git object header has not
yet been encountered in the wild.)</p>
<p>The takeaway from the above paragraphs is Mercurial's storage model
is slightly more robust against hash collisions than Git's because there
are multiple, isolated namespaces for storing content and because all
hashes are chained to previous content. So, when SHA-1 collisions
are more achievable and someone manages to create a collision for a
hash used by version control, Mercurial's storage layer will be able
to cope with that better than Git's.</p>
<p>But the concern about SHA-1 weakness is more about security than storage
robustness. The disaster scenario for version control is that an
attacker could replace content under version control, possibly
undetected. If one can generate a hash collision, then this is
possible. Mercurial's chaining of content provides some defense, but
it isn't sufficient.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">Matt Mackall</a>
that at the present time there are bigger concerns with content
safety than SHA-1 collisions. Namely, if you are an attacker, it is
much easier to introduce a subtle bug that contains a security
vulnerability than to introduce a SHA-1 collision. It is also
much easier to hack the canonical version control server (or any
user or automated agent that has permissions to push to the server)
and add a <em>bad</em> commit. Many projects don't have adequate defenses
to detect such <em>bad</em> commits. Ask yourself: if a bad actor pushed
a <em>bad</em> commit to my repository, would it be detected? Keep in mind
that spoofing author and committer metadata in commits is trivial.
<strong>The current state of Mercurial and Git rely primarily on trust -
not SHA-1 hashes - as their primary defense against malicious
actors.</strong></p>
<p>The desire to move away from SHA-1 has been on the radar of the
Mercurial project for years. For 10+ years, the <em>revlog</em> data
structure has allocated 32 bytes for hashes while only using 20 bytes
for SHA-1. And, the topic of SHA-1 weakness and desire to move to
something stronger has come up at the developer <em>sprints</em> for the
past several years. However, it has never been pressing enough to act
on because <em>there are bigger problems</em>. If it were easy to change, then
Mercurial likely would have done it already. But changing is not easy.
As soon as you introduce a new hash format in a repository, you've
potentially locked out all legacy versions of the Mercurial software
from accessing the repository (unless the repository stores multiple
hashes and allows legacy clients to access the legacy SHA-1 hashes).
There are a number of concerns from legacy compatibility (something
Mercurial cares deeply about) to user experience to even performance
(SHA-1 hashing even at 1000+MB/s floats to the top of performance
profiling for some Mercurial operations). I'm sure the topic will be
discussed heavily at the upcoming developers sprint in a few weeks.</p>
<p>While Mercurial should (and will eventually) replace SHA-1, I think
the biggest improvement Mercurial (or Git for that matter) can make
to repository <em>security</em> is providing a better mechanism for tracking
and auditing trust. Existing mechanisms for GPG signing every commit
aren't practical or are a non-starer for many workflows. And, they
rely on GPG, which has notorious end-user usability problems (I would
prefer my version control tool not subject me to toiling with GPG.)
I've thought about this topic considerably, authoring a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitSigningPlan">proposal for easier and more flexible commit signing</a>.
There is also a related proposal to establish a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitCustodyConcept">cryptographically meaningful chain-of-custody for a patch</a>.
There are some good ideas there. But, like all user-facing
cryptography, the devil is in the details. There are some hard
problems to solve, like how to manage/store public keys that were
used for signatures. While there is some prior art in version control
tools (see Monotone), it is far from a solved problem. And at the
end of the day, you are still left having to trust a set of keys
used to produce signatures.</p>
<p>While version control can keep using cryptographically strong hashes
to mitigate collisions within its storage layer to prevent content
swapping and can employ cryptographic signatures of tracked data,
there is still the issue of trust. Version control can give you the
tools for establishing and auditing trust. Version control can also
provide tools for managing trust relationships. But at the end of the
day, the actual act of trusting trust boils down to people making
decisions (possibly through corporate or project policies). This
will always be a weak link. Therefore, it's what malicious actors
will attack. The best your version control tool can do is give its
users the capability and tools to run a secure and verifiable
repository so that when bad content is inevitably added you can't
blame the version control tool for having poor security.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few minutes ago, I formally enabled a new replication system
for <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>. For the curious,
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/replication.html">technical details</a>
are available.</p>
<p>This impacts you because pushes to hg.mozilla.org should now be
significantly faster. For example, pushes to mozilla-inbound
that used to take 15s now take 2s. Pushes to Try that used to
take 45s now take 10s. (Yes, the old replication system really
added a lot of overhead.) Pushes to hg.mozilla.org are still not
as fast as they could be due to us running the service on 5 year
old hardware (we plan to buy new servers this year) and due to the
use of NFS on the server. However, I believe push latency is now
reasonable for every repo except Try.</p>
<p>The new replication system opens the door to a number of future
improvements. We'd like to stand up mirrors in multiple data
centers - perhaps even offices - so clients have the fastest
connectivity and so we have a better disaster recovery story.
The new replication system facilitates this.</p>
<p>The new replication log is effectively a unified pushlog -
something people have wanted for years. While there is not yet
a public API for it, one could potentially be exposed, perhaps
indirectly via Pulse.</p>
<p>It is now trivial for us to stand up new consumers of the
replication log that react to repository events merely milliseconds
after they occur. This should eventually result in downstream
systems like build automation and conversion to Git repos starting
and thus completing faster.</p>
<p>Finally, the new replication system has been running unofficially for
a few weeks, so you likely won't notice anything different today
(other than removal of some printed messages when you push). What
changed today is the new system is enabled by default and we have
no plans to continue supporting or operating the legacy system.
Good riddance.</p>

  <p>There have been a handful of updates to Mozilla's client-side
Mercurial tools in the past week and all users are encouraged
to pull down the latest commit of mozilla-central and run
<em>mach mercurial-setup</em> to ensure their configuration is up to
date.</p>
<p>Improvements to <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>~</em> are now used in paths when appropriate</li>
<li>Mercurial 3.5.2 is now the oldest version you can run without
  the wizard complaining</li>
<li>The clone bundles feature is enabled when running Mercurial 3.6</li>
<li><em>hg wip</em> is available for configuration</li>
<li><em>hgwatchman</em> (make <em>hg status</em> significantly faster via background
  filesystem watching) is now available on OS X</li>
<li>x509 host key fingerprints are no longer pinned if your Python
  and Mercurial version is modern (this pinning exists in Mercurial
  because old versions of Python don't verify x509 certificates
  properly)</li>
<li>3rd party Mercurial extensions are pulled with extensions disabled
  (to prevent issues with old, incompatible extensions crashing the
  <em>hg pull</em> invocation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The firefoxtree extension has also been updated. It now uses the
new <em>namespaces</em> feature of Mercurial so all Firefox labels/names/refs
are exposed in a <em>firefoxtree</em> namespace instead of as tags. As part
of this change, <strong>you will lose old tags created by this extension
and will need to re-pull repos to recreate them as namespaced
labels</strong>. <em>hg log</em> output will now look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>changeset:   332223:0babaa3edcf9
fxtree:      central
parent:      332188:40038a66525f
parent:      332222:c6fc9d77e86f
user:        Carsten "Tomcat" Book &lt;cbook@mozilla.com&gt;
date:        Wed Dec 16 12:01:46 2015 +0100
summary:     merge mozilla-inbound to mozilla-central a=merge
</code></pre>
<p>(Note the <em>fxtree</em> line.)</p>
<p>The firefoxtree extension also now works with <em>hg share</em>. i.e. if
you <em>hg share</em> from a Firefox repository and <em>hg pull</em> from
the source repo or any shared repo, the labels will be updated in
every repo. This only works on newly-created shares. If you want
to enable this on an existing share, see
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115188#c31">this comment</a>.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.6 (scheduled for release on or shortly after November 1)
contains a number of improvements to cloning. In this post, I will
describe a new feature to help server operators reduce load (while
enabling clients to clone faster) and some performance work to make
clone operations faster on the client.</p>
<p>Cloning repositories can incur a lot of load on servers. For
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a> (the main
Firefox repository), clones require the server to spend 4+ minutes CPU
time and send ~1,230 MB over the network. Multiply by thousands of
clients from build and test automation and developers, and you could
quickly finding yourself running out of CPU cores or network bandwidth.
Scaling Mercurial servers (like many services) can therefore be
challenging. (It's worth noting that Git is in the same boat for
reasons technically similar to Mercurial's.)</p>
<p>Mozilla previously implemented a Mercurial extension to
<a href="/blog/2015/05/29/faster-cloning-from-hg.mozilla.org-with-server-provided-bundles/">seed clones from pre-generated bundle files</a>
so the Mercurial servers themselves don't have to work very hard for
an individual clone. (That linked post goes into the technical
reasons why cloning is expensive). We now offload cloning of frequently
cloned repositories on <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to
<a href="/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">Amazon S3</a> and
<a href="/blog/2015/09/01/serving-mercurial-clones-from-a-cdn/">a CDN</a> and
are diverting 1+ TB/day and countless hours of CPU work away from the
hg.mozilla.org servers themselves.</p>
<p>The positive impact from seeding clones from pre-generated,
externally-hosted bundles has been immense. Load on hg.mozilla.org
dropped off a cliff. Clone times on clients became a lot faster (mainly
because they aren't waiting for a server to dynamically generate/stream
bits). But there was a problem with this approach: it required the
cooperation of clients to install an extension in order for clone load
to be offloaded. It didn't <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm pleased to announce that the ability to seed clones from
server-advertised pre-generated bundles is now a core feature in
Mercurial 3.6!</strong> Server operators can install the
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/file/default/hgext/clonebundles.py">clonebundles extension</a> (it is distributed with Mercurial)
to advertise the location of pre-generated, externally-hosted bundle
files. Compatible clients will automatically clone from the
server-advertised URLs instead of creating potentially excessive load
on the Mercurial server. The implementation is almost identical to what
Mozilla has deployed with great success. <strong>If you operate a Mercurial
server that needs to serve larger repositories (100+ MB) and/or is under
high load, you should be jumping with joy at the existence of this
feature, as it should make scaling problems attached to cloning mostly
go away.</strong></p>
<p>Documentation for server operators is currently in the extension and
can be accessed at the aforementioned URL or with
<em>hg help -e clonebundles</em>. It does require a bit of setup work. But
if you are at the scale where you could benefit from the feature, the
results will almost certainly be worth it.</p>
<p>One caveat is that the feature is currently behind an <em>experimental</em>
flag on the client. This means that it doesn't <em>just work</em> yet. This
is because we want to reserve the right to change some behaviors without
worrying about backwards compatibility. However, I'm pretty confident
the server parts won't change significantly. Or if they do, I'm pretty
committed to providing an easy transition path since I'll need one for
hg.mozilla.org. So, I'm giving server operators a tentative
green light to deploy this extension. I can't guarantee there won't be a
few bumps transitioning to a future release. But it shouldn't be a
break-the-world type of problem. It is my intent to remove the
experimental flag and have the feature enabled by default in
Mercurial 3.7. At that point, server operators just need clients to run
a modern Mercurial release and they can count on drastically reduced
load from cloning.</p>
<p>To help with adoption and testing of the <em>clone bundles</em> feature,
servers advertising bundles will inform compatible clients of the
existence of the feature when they clone:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
requesting all changes
remote: this server supports the experimental &quot;clone bundles&quot; feature that should enable faster and more reliable cloning
remote: help test it by setting the &quot;experimental.clonebundles&quot; config flag to &quot;true&quot;
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
...
</pre></div>

<p>And if you have the feature enabled, you'll see something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
applying clone bundle from https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/mozilla-central/daa7d98525e859d32a3b3e97101e129a897192a1.gzip.hg

</pre></div>

<p>This new <em>clone bundles</em> feature is deployed on hg.mozilla.org. Users of
Mercurial 3.6 can start using it today by cloning from one of the
<a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">repositories with bundles enabled</a>. (If
you have previously installed the <em>bundleclone</em> extension, please be
sure your <em>version-control-tools</em> repository is up to date, as the
extension was recently changed to better interact with the official
feature.)</p>
<p>And that's the <em>clone bundles</em> feature. I hope you are as excited about
it as I am!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 also contains numerous performance improvements that make
cloning faster, regardless of whether you are using <em>clone bundles</em>! For
starters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/836291420d53">Caching just-added entries</a>
  made changelog writing 25% faster.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/39d643252b9f">Reusing file handles</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced the number of file
  opens, closes, and writes.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/56a640b0f656">Avoiding excessive file flushing</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced system call count.</li>
</ul>
<p>These performance enhancements will make all operations that write
new repository data faster. But it will be felt most on clone and pull
operations on the client and push operations on the server.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive performance optimizations was to a Python
class that converts a generator of raw data chunks to something that
resembles a file object so it can be read() from.
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/6ae14d1ca3aa">Refactoring read()</a>
to avoid <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>
operations and an extra string slice and allocation made <em>unbundle</em>
operations 15-20% faster. Since this function can handle hundreds of
megabytes or even gigabytes of data across hundreds of thousands of
calls, small improvements like this can make a huge difference! This
patch was a stark reminder that function calls, collection mutations,
string slicing, and object allocation all can have a significant cost
in a higher-level, garbage collected language like Python.</p>
<p>The end result of all this performance optimization on applying a
mozilla-central gzip bundle on Linux on an i7-6700K:</p>
<ul>
<li>35-40s wall time faster (~245s to ~205s) (~84% of original)</li>
<li>write(2) calls reduced from 1,372,411 to 679,045 (~49% of
  original)</li>
<li>close(2) calls reduced from 405,147 to 235,039 (~58% of
  original)</li>
<li>total system calls reduced from 5,120,893 to 2,938,479 (~57% of
  original)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the same operation on Windows 10 on the same machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>~300s wall time faster (933s to 633s) (~68% of original)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed the discrepancy between Linux and Windows wall
times, where Windows is 2-4x slower than Linux. What gives? The reason
is closing file handles that have been appended to is slow on Windows.
For more, read my <a href="/blog/2015/10/22/append-i/o-performance-on-windows/">recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Mercurial writes ~226,000 files during a clone of mozilla-central
(excluding the working copy). Assuming 2ms per file close operation,
that comes out to <strong>~450s just for file close operations</strong>! (All
operations are on the same thread.) The current wall time difference
between clone times on Windows and Linux is ~428s. So it's fair to say
that waiting on file closes accounts for most of this.</p>
<p>Along the same vein, the aforementioned performance work reduced total
number of file close operations during a mozilla-central clone by
~165,000. Again assuming 2ms per file close, that comes to ~330s, which
is in the same ballpark as the ~300s wall time decrease we see on
Windows in Mercurial 3.6. <strong>Writing - and therefore closing - hundreds
of thousands of files handles is slower on Windows and accounts for most
of the performance difference on that platform.</strong></p>
<p>Empowered by this knowledge, I wrote some patches to move file closing
to a background thread on Windows. The results were
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-September/073788.html">promising</a>
(minutes saved when writing 100,000+ files). Unfortunately, I didn't
have time to finish these patches for Mercurial 3.6. Hopefully they'll
make it into 3.7. I also have some mad scientist ideas for alternate
storage mechanisms that don't rely on hundreds of thousands of files.
This should enable clones to run at 100+ MB/s on all platforms -
basically as fast as your network and system I/O can keep up (yes,
Python and Windows are capable of this throughput). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>And that's a summary of the cloning improvements in Mercurial 3.6!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 is currently in release candidate. Please help test
it by downloading the RC at
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a>.
Mercurial 3.6 final is due for release on or shortly after November 1.
There is a large gathering of Mercurial contributors in London this
weekend. So if a bug is reported, I can pretty much guarantee a lot of
eyeballs will see it and there's a good chance it will be acted upon.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>For the past few months, Mozilla has been
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">serving Mercurial clones from Amazon S3</a>.
We upload snapshots (called <em>bundles</em>) of large and/or high-traffic
repositories to S3. We have a custom Mercurial extension on the
client and server that knows how to exchange the URLs for these
snapshots and to transparently use them to bootstrap a clone. The
end result is drastically reduced Mercurial server load and faster
clone times. The benefits are seriously ridiculous when you operate
version control at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a CDN.
You can easily configure it up to be backed by an S3 bucket. So
we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/</a> is
Mozilla's CDN for hosting Mercurial data. Currently it's just bundles to
be used for cloning.</p>
<p>As of today, if you
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">install the bundleclone Mercurial extension</a>
and <em>hg clone</em> a repository on
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> such as
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>), the CDN
URLs will be preferred by default. (Previously we preferred S3 URLs
that hit servers in Oregon, USA.)</p>
<p><strong>This should result in clone time reductions for Mozillians not
close to Oregon, USA</strong>, as the CloudFront CDN has servers all across
the globe and your Mercurial clone should be bootstrapped from the
closest and hopefully therefore fastest server to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need the the aforementioned <em>bundleclone</em>
extension installed for this to work. But, this should only be
temporary: I've
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StaticBundlePlan">proposed</a>
integrating this feature into the core of Mercurial so if a client
talks to a server advertising pre-generated bundles the clone
offload <em>just works</em>. I already have tentative buy-in from one
Mercurial maintainer. So hopefully I can land this feature in
Mercurial 3.6, which will be released November 1. After that,
I imagine some high-traffic Mercurial servers (such as Bitbucket)
will be very keen to deploy this so CPU load on their servers
is drastically reduced.</p>
