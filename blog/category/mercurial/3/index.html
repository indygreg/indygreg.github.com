  <p>Just a few minutes ago, I deployed some updates to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to display more
metadata on changeset pages. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4b69a62d1905">4b69a62d1905</a>,
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4023d54436">dc4023d54436</a>,
and <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b617a57d6bf1">b617a57d6bf1</a>
for examples of what's shown.</p>
<p>We currently display:</p>
<ul>
<li>More detailed pushlog info. (Before you had to load another page to
  see things like the date of the push.)</li>
<li>The list of reviewers, each being a link that searches for other
  changesets they've reviewed.</li>
<li>A concise list of bugs referenced in the commit message.</li>
<li>Links to changesets that were backed out by this changeset.</li>
<li>On changesets that were backed out, we <em>may</em> also display a message
  that the changeset was backed out.</li>
<li>For Firefox repos, we also display the application <em>milestone</em>. This
  is the Gecko/app version recorded in the <em>config/milestone.txt</em> file
  in that changeset. The value can be used to quickly answer the
  question <em>What versions of Firefox have this changeset.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any issues or have requests for new features, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>.</p>
<p>This work is built on top of a feature I added to Mercurial 3.4 to make
it easier to inject extra data into Mercurial's web templates. We just
deployed Mercurial 3.4.1 to hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It's worth noting
that this deployment happened in the middle of the day with no
user-perceived downtime. This is a far cry from where we were a year
ago, when any server change required a maintenance window. We've
invested a lot of work into a test suite for this service so we can
continuously deploy without fear of breaking things. Moving fast feels
so good.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When you type <em>hg clone</em>, the Mercurial server will create a <em>bundle</em>
from repository content at the time of the request and stream it to
the client. (Git works essentially the same way.)</p>
<p>This approach usually <em>just works</em>. But there are some downsides,
particularly with large repositories.</p>
<p>Creating bundles for large repositories is not cheap. For
mozilla-central, Firefox's main repository, it takes ~280s of CPU time
on my 2014 MacBook Pro to generate a bundle. Every time a client runs a
<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>, a server somewhere
is spinning a CPU core generating ~1.1 GB of data. What's more, if
another clone arrives at the same time, another process will perform
the exact same work! When we talk about multiple minutes of CPU time
per request, this extra work starts to add up.</p>
<p>Another problem with large repositories is interrupted downloads. If
you suffer a connectivity blip during your <em>clone</em> command, you'll
have to start from scratch. This potentially means re-transferring
hundreds of megabytes from the server. It also means the server has
to generate a new bundle, consuming even more CPU time. This is not
good for the user or the server.</p>
<p>There have been multiple outages of hg.mozilla.org as a result of
the service being flooded with clone requests to large repositories.
Dozens of clients (most of them in Firefox or Firefox OS
release automation) have cloned the same repository around the same
time and overwhelmed network bandwidth in the data center or CPU
cores on the Mercurial servers.</p>
<p>A common solution to this problem is to not use the <em>clone</em> command
to receive initial repository data from the server. Instead, a
static <em>bundle</em> file will be generated and made available to clients.
Clients will call <em>hg init</em> to create an empty repository then will
perform an <em>hg unbundle</em> to apply the contents of a pre-generated
bundle file. They will then run <em>hg pull</em> to fetch new data that
was created after the bundle was generated. (It's worth noting that
Git's <em>clone --reference</em> option is similar.)</p>
<p>This is a good technical solution. Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation have effectively implemented this. However, it is a lot of
work: you have to build your own bundle generation and hosting
infrastructure and you have to remember that every <em>hg clone</em> should
probably be using bundles instead. It is extra complexity and complexity
that must be undertaken by every client. If a client forgets, the
consequences can be disastrous (clone flooding leading to service
outage). Client-side opt-in is prone to lapses and doesn't scale.</p>
<p><strong>As of today, we've deployed a more scalable, server-based solution to
hg.mozilla.org.</strong></p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org is now itself generating bundles for a handful of
repositories, including mozilla-central, inbound, fx-team, and
mozharness. These bundles are being uploaded to Amazon S3. And
<strong>those bundles are being advertised by the server over Mercurial's
wire protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>When you install the <em>bundleclone</em> Mercurial extension, <em>hg clone</em> is
taught to look for bundles being advertised on the server. If a bundle
is available, the bundle is downloaded, applied, and then the client
does the equivalent of an <em>hg pull</em> to fetch all new data since when the
bundle was generated. If a bundle exists, it is used transparently: no
client side cooperation is needed beyond installing the <em>bundleclone</em>
extension. If a bundle doesn't exist, it simply falls back to
Mercurial's default behavior. <strong>This effectively shifts responsibility
for doing efficient clones from clients to server operators, which
means server operators don't need cooperation from clients to enact
important service changes.</strong> Before, if clients weren't using bundles,
we'd have to wait for clients to update their code. Now, we can see
a repository is being cloned heavily and start generating bundles for
it without having to wait for the client to deploy new code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we've built primitive <em>content negotiation</em> into the
process. The server doesn't simply advertise one bundle file: it
advertises several bundle files. We offer gzip, bzip2, and <em>stream</em>
bundles. gzip is what Mercurial uses by default. It works OK. bzip2
bundles are smaller, but they take longer to process. <em>stream</em> bundles
are essentially tar archives of the <em>.hg/store</em> directory and are larger
than gzip bundles, but insanely fast because there is very little CPU
required to apply them. In addition, we advertise URLs for multiple S3
regions, currently us-west-2 (Oregon) and us-east-1 (Virginia). This
enables clients to prefer the bundle most appropriate for them.</p>
<p>A benefit of serving bundles from S3 is that Firefox and Firefox OS
release automation (the biggest consumers of hg.mozilla.org) live in
Amazon EC2. They are able to fetch from S3 over a gigabit network.
And, since we're transferring data within the same AWS region, there
are no data transfer costs. Previously, we were transferring ~1.1 GB
from a Mozilla data center to EC2 for each clone. This took up bandwidth
in Mozilla's network and cost Mozilla money to send data thousands of
miles away. And, we never came close to saturating a gigabit network (we
do with stream bundles). Wins everywhere!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">full instructions</a>
detail how to use <em>bundleclone</em>. <strong>I recommend everyone at Mozilla
install the extension</strong> because there should be no downside to doing it.</p>
<p>Once <em>bundleclone</em> is deployed to Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation, we should hopefully never again see those machines bring
down hg.mozilla.org due to a flood of clone requests. We should also
see a drastic reduction in load to hg.mozilla.org. I'm optimistic
bandwidth will decrease by over 50%!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the functionality from the <em>bundleclone</em> extension
is coming to vanilla Mercurial. The functionality (which was initially
added by Mozilla's Mike Hommey) is part of Mercurial's <em>bundle2</em> protocol,
which is available, but isn't enabled by default yet. <em>bundleclone</em> is thus
a temporary solution to bring us server stability and client
improvements until modern Mercurial versions are deployed everywhere
in a few months time.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to credit Augie Fackler for the
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.devel/54872/focus=54872">original idea</a>
for server-assisted bundle-based clones.</p>

  <p>When Firefox made the switch from CVS to Mercurial in March 2007, the
CVS history wasn't imported into Mercurial. There were good reasons for
this at the time. But it's a decision that continues to have
side-effects. I am surprised how often I hear of engineers wanting to
access blame and commit info from commits now more than 9 years old!</p>
<p>When individuals created a Git mirror of the Firefox repository a few
years ago, they correctly decided that importing CVS history would be
a good idea. They also correctly decided to combine the logically same
but physically separate <em>release</em> and <em>integration</em> repositories into a
unified Git repository. These are things we can't easily do to the
canonical Mercurial repository because it would break SHA-1 hashes,
breaking many systems, and it would require significant changes in
process, among other reasons.</p>
<p>While Firefox developers do have access to a single Firefox repository
with full CVS history (the Git mirror), they still aren't satisfied.</p>
<p>Running <em>git blame</em> (or <em>hg blame</em> for that matter) can be very
expensive. For this reason, the blame interface is disabled on many
web-based source viewers by default. On GitHub, some blame URLs for
the Firefox repository time out and cause GitHub to display an error
message. No matter how hard you try, you can't easily get blame results
(running a local Git HTTP/HTML interface is still difficult compared to
<em>hg serve</em>).</p>
<p>Another reason developers aren't satisfied with the Git mirror is that
Git's querying tools pale in comparison to Mercurial's. I've said it
before and I'll say it again: Mercurial's revision sets and templates
are incredibly useful features that enable advanced repository querying
and reporting. Git's offerings come nowhere close. (I <em>really</em> wish Git
would steal these awesome features from Mercurial.)</p>
<p>Anyway, enough people were complaining about the lack of a Mercurial
Firefox repository with full CVS history that I decided to create one.
If you point your browsers or Mercurial clients to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full">https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full</a>,
you'll be able to access it.</p>
<p>The process used for the conversion was the simplest possible: I used
hg-git to convert the Git mirror back to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Unlike the Git mirror, I didn't include all heads in this new
repository. Instead, there is only mozilla-central's head (the current
development tip). If I were doing this properly, I'd include all heads,
like
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-aggregate">gecko-aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>I'm well aware there are oddities in the Git mirror and they now
exist in this new repository as well. My goal for this conversion was to
deliver something: it wasn't a goal to deliver the most correct result
possible.</p>
<p>At this time, this repository should be considered an unstable science
experiment. <strong>By no means should you rely on this repository.</strong> But if
you find it useful, I'd appreciate hearing about it. If enough people
ask, we could probably make this more official.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="http://git-merge.com/">Git Merge 2015</a> was a Git user conference held
in Paris on April 8 and 9, 2015.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a version control geek. I'm also responsible for a large
part of Mozilla's version control hosting. So, when the videos were
made public, you can bet I took interest.</p>
<p>This post contains my notes from a few of the Git Merge talks. I try
to separate content/facts from my opinions by isolating my opinions
(within parenthesis).</p>
<h2>Git at Google</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/git-at-google-dave-borowitz.html">Git at Google: Making Big Projects (and everyone else) Happy</a>
is from a Googler (Dave Borowitz) who works on JGit for the Git
infrastructure team at Google.</p>
<p>"Everybody in this room is going to feel some kind of pain working with
Git at scale at some time in their career."</p>
<p>First Git usage at Google in 2008 for Android. 2011 googlesource.com
launches.</p>
<p>24,000 total Git repos at Google. 77.1M requests/day. 30-40 TB/day. 2-3
Gbps.</p>
<p>Largest repo is 210GB (not public it appears).</p>
<p>800 repos in AOSP. Google maintains internal fork of all Android repos
(so they can throw stuff over the wall). Fresh AOSP tree is 17 GiB. Lots
of contracts dictating access.</p>
<p>Chrome repos include Chromium, Blink, Chromium OS. Performed giant
Subversion migration. Developers of Chrome very set in their ways. Had
many workflows integrated with Subversion web interface. Subversion
blame was fast, Git blame slow. Built caching backend for Git blame to
make developers happy.</p>
<p>Chromium 2.9 GiB, 3.6M objects, 390k commits. Blink 5.3 GiB, 3.1M
objects, 177k commits. They merged them into a monorepo. Mention of
Facebook's monorepo talk and Mercurial scaling efforts for a repo larger
then Chromium/Blink monorepo. Benefits to developers for doing atomic
refactorings, etc.</p>
<p>"Being big is hard."</p>
<p>AOSP: 1 Gbps -&gt; 2 minutes for 17 GiB. 20 Mbps -&gt; 3 hours. Flaky internet
combined with non-resumable clone results in badness. Delta resolution
can take a while. Checkout of hundreds of thousands of files can be
slow, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>"As tool developers... it's hard to tell people don't check in large
binaries, do things this way, ... when all they are trying to do is
get their job done." (I couldn't agree more: tools should ideally not
impose sub-optimal workflows.)</p>
<p>They prefer scaling pain to supporting multiple tools. (I think this
meant don't use multiple VCSs if you can just make one scale.)</p>
<p>Shallow clone beneficial. But some commands don't work. log not very
useful.</p>
<p>Narrow clones mentioned. Apparently talked about elsewhere at Git Merge
not captured on video. Non-trivial problem for Git. "We have no idea
when this is going to happen."</p>
<p>Split repos until narrow clone is available. Google wrote repo to manage
multiple repos. They view repo and multiple repos as stop-gap until
narrow clone is implemented.</p>
<p>git submodule needs some love. Git commands don't handle submodules
or multiple repos very well. They'd like to see repo features
incorporated into git submodule.</p>
<p>Transition to server operation.</p>
<p>Pre-2.0, counting objects was hard. For Linux kernel, 60s 100% CPU time
per clone to count objects. "Linux isn't even that big."</p>
<p>Traditionally Git is single homed. Load from users. Load from
automation.</p>
<p>Told anecdote about how Google's automation once recloned the repo after
a failed Git command. Accidentally made a change one day that caused a
command to persistently fail. DoS against server. (We've had this at
Mozilla.)</p>
<p>Garbage collection on server is CPU intensive and necessary. Takes cores
away from clients.</p>
<p>Reachability bitmaps implemented in JGit, ported to Git 2.0. Counting
objects for Linux clones went from 60s CPU to ~100ms.</p>
<p>Google puts static, pre-generated bundles on a CDN. Client downloads
bundle then does incremental fetch. Massive reduction in server load.
Bundle files better for users. Resumable.</p>
<p>They have ideas for integrating bundles into git fetch, but it's
"a little way's off." (This feature is partially implemented in
Mercurial 3.4 and we have plans for using it at Mozilla.) It's feature
in repo today.</p>
<p>Shared filesystem would be really nice to spread CPU load. NFS "works."
Performance problems with high throughput repositories.</p>
<p>Master-mirror replication can help. Problems with replication lag.
Consistency is hard.</p>
<p>Google uses a distributed Git store using Bigtable and GFS built on
JGit. Git-aware load balancer. Completely separate pool of garbage
collection workers. They do replication to multiple datacenters before
pushes. 6 datacenters across world. Some of their stuff is open source.
A lot isn't.</p>
<p>Humans have difficulty managing hundreds of repositories. "How do you as
a human know what you need to modify?" Monorepos have this problem too.
Inherent with lots of content. (Seemed to imply it is worse with
multiple repos than with a monorepo.)</p>
<p>Porting changes between forks is hard. e.g. cherry picking between
internal and external Android repos.</p>
<p>ACLs are a mess.</p>
<p>Google built Gerrit code review. It does ACLs, auto rebasing, release
branch management. It's a swiss army knife. (This aligns with my
vision for MozReview and code-centric development.)</p>
<h2>Scaling Git at Twitter</h2>
<p>Wilhelm Bierbaum from Twitter talks about
<a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/scaling-git-at-twitter-wilhelm-bierbaum.html">Scaling Git at Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"We've decided it's really important to make Twitter a good place to work for
developers. Source control is one of those points where we were
lacking. We had some performance problems with Git in the past."</p>
<p>Twitter runs a monorepo. Used to be 3 repos. "Working with a single
repository is the way they prefer to develop software when developing
hundreds of services." They also have a single build system. They have
a geo diverse workforce.</p>
<p>They use normal canonical implementation of Git + some optimizations.</p>
<p>Benefits of a monorepo:</p>
<p>Visibility. Easier for people to find code in one repo. Code search tools
tailored towards single repos.</p>
<p>Single toolchain. single set of tools to build, test, and deploy. When
improvements to tools made, everyone benefits because one toolchain.</p>
<p>Easy to share code (particularly generated code like IDL). When operating
many small services, services developed together. Code duplication is
minimized. Twitter relies on IDL heavily.</p>
<p>Simpler to predict the impact of your changes. Easier to look at single
code base then to understand how multiple code bases interact. Easy to
make a change and see what breaks rather than submit changes to N repos
and do testing in N repos.</p>
<p>Makes refactoring less arduous.</p>
<p>Surfaces architecture issues earlier.</p>
<p>Breaking changes easier to coordinate</p>
<p>Drawbacks of monorepos:</p>
<p>Large disk footprint for full history.</p>
<p>Tuning filesystem only goes so far.</p>
<p>Forces some organizations to adopt sparse checkouts and shallow clones.</p>
<p>Submodules aren't good enough to use. <em>add</em> and <em>commit</em> don't recognize
submodule boundaries very well and aren't very usable.</p>
<p>"To us, using a tool such as repo that is in effect a secondary version
control tool on top of Git does not feel right and doesn't lead to a
fluid experience."</p>
<p>Twitter has centralized use of Git. Don't really benefit from
distributed version control system. Feature branches. Goal is to live as
close to master as possible. Long-running branches discouraged. Fewer
conflicts to resolve.</p>
<p>They have project-level ownership system. But any developer can change
anything.</p>
<p>They have lots of read-only replicas. Highly available writable server.</p>
<p>They use reference repos heavily so object exchange overhead is
manageable.</p>
<p>Scaling issues with many refs. Partially due to how refs are stored on
disk. File locking limits in OS. Commands like status, add, and commit
can be slow, even with repo garbage collected and packed. Locking issues
with garbage collection.</p>
<p>Incorporated file alteration monitor to make status faster. Reference to
Facebook's work on watchman and its Mercurial integration. Significant
impact on OS X. "Pretty much all our developers use OS X." (I assume
they are using Watchman with Git - I've seen patches for this on the Git
mailing list but they haven't been merged into core yet.)</p>
<p>They implemented a custom index format. Adopted faster hashing
algorithm that uses native instructions.</p>
<p>Discovery with many refs didn't scale. 13 MB of raw data for refs
exchange at Twitter. (!!) Experimenting with clients sending a bloom
filter of refs. Hacked it together via HTTP header.</p>
<p>Fetch protocol is expensive. Lots of random I/O. Can take minutes
to do incremental fetches. Bitmap indices help, but aren't good enough
for them. Since they have central and well-defined environment, they
changed fetch protocol to work like a journal: send all changed data since
client's last fetch. Server work is essentially a sendfile system call.
git push appends push packs to a log-structured journal. On fetch,
clients "replay" the transactions from the journal. Similar to MySQL
binary log replication. (This is very similar to some of the Mercurial
replication work I'm doing at Mozilla. Yay technical validation.)
(Append only files are also how Mercurial's storage model works by
default.)</p>
<p>Log-structured data exchange means server side is cheap. They can insert
HTTP caches to handle Range header aware requests.</p>
<p>Without this hack, they can't scale their servers.</p>
<p>Initial clone is seeded by BitTorrent.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone's unmerged feature branches are on the one
central repo and get transferred everywhere by default. Their journal
fetch can selectively fetch refs so this isn't a huge problem.</p>
<p>They'd like to experiment with sparse repos. But they haven't gotten to
that yet. They'd like a better storage abstraction in Git to enable
necessary future scalability. They want a network-aware storage backend.
Local objects not necessary if the network has them.</p>
<p>They are running a custom Git distribution/fork on clients. But they
don't want to maintain forever. Prefer to send upstream.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As of a few minutes ago, we explicitly dropped support for Mercurial 3.0
for all the Mercurial code in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository. File issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1162304">bug 1162304</a>.</p>
<p>Code may still work against Mercurial 3.0. But it isn't supported and
could break hard at any time.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple versions of <em>any</em> software carries
with it some cost. The people writing tooling around Mercurial are busy.
It is a waste of our time to bend over backwards to support old versions
of software that <strong>all</strong> users should have upgraded from months ago.
Still using older Mercurial versions means you aren't getting the best
performance and may encounter bugs that have since been fixed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mozilla tailored Mercurial installation instructions</a>
for info on how to upgrade to the latest/greatest Mercurial version.</p>
