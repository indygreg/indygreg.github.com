  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>There have been a handful of updates to Mozilla's client-side
Mercurial tools in the past week and all users are encouraged
to pull down the latest commit of mozilla-central and run
<em>mach mercurial-setup</em> to ensure their configuration is up to
date.</p>
<p>Improvements to <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>~</em> are now used in paths when appropriate</li>
<li>Mercurial 3.5.2 is now the oldest version you can run without
  the wizard complaining</li>
<li>The clone bundles feature is enabled when running Mercurial 3.6</li>
<li><em>hg wip</em> is available for configuration</li>
<li><em>hgwatchman</em> (make <em>hg status</em> significantly faster via background
  filesystem watching) is now available on OS X</li>
<li>x509 host key fingerprints are no longer pinned if your Python
  and Mercurial version is modern (this pinning exists in Mercurial
  because old versions of Python don't verify x509 certificates
  properly)</li>
<li>3rd party Mercurial extensions are pulled with extensions disabled
  (to prevent issues with old, incompatible extensions crashing the
  <em>hg pull</em> invocation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The firefoxtree extension has also been updated. It now uses the
new <em>namespaces</em> feature of Mercurial so all Firefox labels/names/refs
are exposed in a <em>firefoxtree</em> namespace instead of as tags. As part
of this change, <strong>you will lose old tags created by this extension
and will need to re-pull repos to recreate them as namespaced
labels</strong>. <em>hg log</em> output will now look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>changeset:   332223:0babaa3edcf9
fxtree:      central
parent:      332188:40038a66525f
parent:      332222:c6fc9d77e86f
user:        Carsten "Tomcat" Book &lt;cbook@mozilla.com&gt;
date:        Wed Dec 16 12:01:46 2015 +0100
summary:     merge mozilla-inbound to mozilla-central a=merge
</code></pre>
<p>(Note the <em>fxtree</em> line.)</p>
<p>The firefoxtree extension also now works with <em>hg share</em>. i.e. if
you <em>hg share</em> from a Firefox repository and <em>hg pull</em> from
the source repo or any shared repo, the labels will be updated in
every repo. This only works on newly-created shares. If you want
to enable this on an existing share, see
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115188#c31">this comment</a>.</p>

  <small>October 22, 2015 at 05:00 AM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.6 (scheduled for release on or shortly after November 1)
contains a number of improvements to cloning. In this post, I will
describe a new feature to help server operators reduce load (while
enabling clients to clone faster) and some performance work to make
clone operations faster on the client.</p>
<p>Cloning repositories can incur a lot of load on servers. For
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a> (the main
Firefox repository), clones require the server to spend 4+ minutes CPU
time and send ~1,230 MB over the network. Multiply by thousands of
clients from build and test automation and developers, and you could
quickly finding yourself running out of CPU cores or network bandwidth.
Scaling Mercurial servers (like many services) can therefore be
challenging. (It's worth noting that Git is in the same boat for
reasons technically similar to Mercurial's.)</p>
<p>Mozilla previously implemented a Mercurial extension to
<a href="/blog/2015/05/29/faster-cloning-from-hg.mozilla.org-with-server-provided-bundles/">seed clones from pre-generated bundle files</a>
so the Mercurial servers themselves don't have to work very hard for
an individual clone. (That linked post goes into the technical
reasons why cloning is expensive). We now offload cloning of frequently
cloned repositories on <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to
<a href="/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">Amazon S3</a> and
<a href="/blog/2015/09/01/serving-mercurial-clones-from-a-cdn/">a CDN</a> and
are diverting 1+ TB/day and countless hours of CPU work away from the
hg.mozilla.org servers themselves.</p>
<p>The positive impact from seeding clones from pre-generated,
externally-hosted bundles has been immense. Load on hg.mozilla.org
dropped off a cliff. Clone times on clients became a lot faster (mainly
because they aren't waiting for a server to dynamically generate/stream
bits). But there was a problem with this approach: it required the
cooperation of clients to install an extension in order for clone load
to be offloaded. It didn't <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm pleased to announce that the ability to seed clones from
server-advertised pre-generated bundles is now a core feature in
Mercurial 3.6!</strong> Server operators can install the
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/file/default/hgext/clonebundles.py">clonebundles extension</a> (it is distributed with Mercurial)
to advertise the location of pre-generated, externally-hosted bundle
files. Compatible clients will automatically clone from the
server-advertised URLs instead of creating potentially excessive load
on the Mercurial server. The implementation is almost identical to what
Mozilla has deployed with great success. <strong>If you operate a Mercurial
server that needs to serve larger repositories (100+ MB) and/or is under
high load, you should be jumping with joy at the existence of this
feature, as it should make scaling problems attached to cloning mostly
go away.</strong></p>
<p>Documentation for server operators is currently in the extension and
can be accessed at the aforementioned URL or with
<em>hg help -e clonebundles</em>. It does require a bit of setup work. But
if you are at the scale where you could benefit from the feature, the
results will almost certainly be worth it.</p>
<p>One caveat is that the feature is currently behind an <em>experimental</em>
flag on the client. This means that it doesn't <em>just work</em> yet. This
is because we want to reserve the right to change some behaviors without
worrying about backwards compatibility. However, I'm pretty confident
the server parts won't change significantly. Or if they do, I'm pretty
committed to providing an easy transition path since I'll need one for
hg.mozilla.org. So, I'm giving server operators a tentative
green light to deploy this extension. I can't guarantee there won't be a
few bumps transitioning to a future release. But it shouldn't be a
break-the-world type of problem. It is my intent to remove the
experimental flag and have the feature enabled by default in
Mercurial 3.7. At that point, server operators just need clients to run
a modern Mercurial release and they can count on drastically reduced
load from cloning.</p>
<p>To help with adoption and testing of the <em>clone bundles</em> feature,
servers advertising bundles will inform compatible clients of the
existence of the feature when they clone:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
requesting all changes
remote: this server supports the experimental &quot;clone bundles&quot; feature that should enable faster and more reliable cloning
remote: help test it by setting the &quot;experimental.clonebundles&quot; config flag to &quot;true&quot;
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
...
</pre></div>

<p>And if you have the feature enabled, you'll see something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central

</pre></div>

<p>This new <em>clone bundles</em> feature is deployed on hg.mozilla.org. Users of
Mercurial 3.6 can start using it today by cloning from one of the
<a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">repositories with bundles enabled</a>. (If
you have previously installed the <em>bundleclone</em> extension, please be
sure your <em>version-control-tools</em> repository is up to date, as the
extension was recently changed to better interact with the official
feature.)</p>
<p>And that's the <em>clone bundles</em> feature. I hope you are as excited about
it as I am!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 also contains numerous performance improvements that make
cloning faster, regardless of whether you are using <em>clone bundles</em>! For
starters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/836291420d53">Caching just-added entries</a>
  made changelog writing 25% faster.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/39d643252b9f">Reusing file handles</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced the number of file
  opens, closes, and writes.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/56a640b0f656">Avoiding excessive file flushing</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced system call count.</li>
</ul>
<p>These performance enhancements will make all operations that write
new repository data faster. But it will be felt most on clone and pull
operations on the client and push operations on the server.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive performance optimizations was to a Python
class that converts a generator of raw data chunks to something that
resembles a file object so it can be read() from.
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/6ae14d1ca3aa">Refactoring read()</a>
to avoid <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>
operations and an extra string slice and allocation made <em>unbundle</em>
operations 15-20% faster. Since this function can handle hundreds of
megabytes or even gigabytes of data across hundreds of thousands of
calls, small improvements like this can make a huge difference! This
patch was a stark reminder that function calls, collection mutations,
string slicing, and object allocation all can have a significant cost
in a higher-level, garbage collected language like Python.</p>
<p>The end result of all this performance optimization on applying a
mozilla-central gzip bundle on Linux on an i7-6700K:</p>
<ul>
<li>35-40s wall time faster (~245s to ~205s) (~84% of original)</li>
<li>write(2) calls reduced from 1,372,411 to 679,045 (~49% of
  original)</li>
<li>close(2) calls reduced from 405,147 to 235,039 (~58% of
  original)</li>
<li>total system calls reduced from 5,120,893 to 2,938,479 (~57% of
  original)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the same operation on Windows 10 on the same machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>~300s wall time faster (933s to 633s) (~68% of original)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed the discrepancy between Linux and Windows wall
times, where Windows is 2-4x slower than Linux. What gives? The reason
is closing file handles that have been appended to is slow on Windows.
For more, read my <a href="/blog/2015/10/22/append-i/o-performance-on-windows/">recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Mercurial writes ~226,000 files during a clone of mozilla-central
(excluding the working copy). Assuming 2ms per file close operation,
that comes out to <strong>~450s just for file close operations</strong>! (All
operations are on the same thread.) The current wall time difference
between clone times on Windows and Linux is ~428s. So it's fair to say
that waiting on file closes accounts for most of this.</p>
<p>Along the same vein, the aforementioned performance work reduced total
number of file close operations during a mozilla-central clone by
~165,000. Again assuming 2ms per file close, that comes to ~330s, which
is in the same ballpark as the ~300s wall time decrease we see on
Windows in Mercurial 3.6. <strong>Writing - and therefore closing - hundreds
of thousands of files handles is slower on Windows and accounts for most
of the performance difference on that platform.</strong></p>
<p>Empowered by this knowledge, I wrote some patches to move file closing
to a background thread on Windows. The results were
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-September/073788.html">promising</a>
(minutes saved when writing 100,000+ files). Unfortunately, I didn't
have time to finish these patches for Mercurial 3.6. Hopefully they'll
make it into 3.7. I also have some mad scientist ideas for alternate
storage mechanisms that don't rely on hundreds of thousands of files.
This should enable clones to run at 100+ MB/s on all platforms -
basically as fast as your network and system I/O can keep up (yes,
Python and Windows are capable of this throughput). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>And that's a summary of the cloning improvements in Mercurial 3.6!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 is currently in release candidate. Please help test
it by downloading the RC at
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a>.
Mercurial 3.6 final is due for release on or shortly after November 1.
There is a large gathering of Mercurial contributors in London this
weekend. So if a bug is reported, I can pretty much guarantee a lot of
eyeballs will see it and there's a good chance it will be acted upon.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>For the past few months, Mozilla has been
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">serving Mercurial clones from Amazon S3</a>.
We upload snapshots (called <em>bundles</em>) of large and/or high-traffic
repositories to S3. We have a custom Mercurial extension on the
client and server that knows how to exchange the URLs for these
snapshots and to transparently use them to bootstrap a clone. The
end result is drastically reduced Mercurial server load and faster
clone times. The benefits are seriously ridiculous when you operate
version control at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a CDN.
You can easily configure it up to be backed by an S3 bucket. So
we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/</a> is
Mozilla's CDN for hosting Mercurial data. Currently it's just bundles to
be used for cloning.</p>
<p>As of today, if you
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">install the bundleclone Mercurial extension</a>
and <em>hg clone</em> a repository on
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> such as
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>), the CDN
URLs will be preferred by default. (Previously we preferred S3 URLs
that hit servers in Oregon, USA.)</p>
<p><strong>This should result in clone time reductions for Mozillians not
close to Oregon, USA</strong>, as the CloudFront CDN has servers all across
the globe and your Mercurial clone should be bootstrapped from the
closest and hopefully therefore fastest server to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need the the aforementioned <em>bundleclone</em>
extension installed for this to work. But, this should only be
temporary: I've
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StaticBundlePlan">proposed</a>
integrating this feature into the core of Mercurial so if a client
talks to a server advertising pre-generated bundles the clone
offload <em>just works</em>. I already have tentative buy-in from one
Mercurial maintainer. So hopefully I can land this feature in
Mercurial 3.6, which will be released November 1. After that,
I imagine some high-traffic Mercurial servers (such as Bitbucket)
will be very keen to deploy this so CPU load on their servers
is drastically reduced.</p>

Unfortunately, due to the presence of legacy code on hg.mozilla.org
providing similar functionality, we weren't able to deploy this

ago.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that as of today, JSON is now exposed from

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Sometime last week we enabled a new API on hg.mozilla.org:
<em>json-mozbuildinfo</em>. This endpoint will return JSON describing
moz.build-derived metadata about the files that changed in a commit.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-mozbuildinfo/1164ec236273">Example</a>.
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/mozbuildinfo.html">Docs</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to eventually leverage this API to do cool things like
have MozReview automatically file bugs in the appropriate component and
assign appropriate reviewers given the set of changed files in a commit.</p>
<p>The API is currently only available on mozilla-central. And, we have
very conservative resource limits in place. So large commits may cause
it to error out. As such, the API is considered experimental. Also,
performance is not as optimal as it could be. You have to start
somewhere.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Guillaume Destuynder (kang) for his help with the
security side of things. When I started on this project, I didn't think
I'd be writing
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/02e353037996/testing/docker/builder-hgweb-chroot/mozbuild-eval.c">C code for spawning secure processes</a>,
but here we are. In the not so distant future, I'll likely be adding
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a>
into the mix, which will make the execution environment as
or more secure than the Firefox content process sandbox, depending
on how it is implemented. The rabbit holes we find ourselves in to
implement proper security...</p>
