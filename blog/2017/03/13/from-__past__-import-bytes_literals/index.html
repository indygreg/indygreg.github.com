  <p>Last year, I simultaneously committed one of the ugliest and
impressive hacks of my programming <em>career</em>. I haven't had time
to write about it. Until now.</p>
<p>In summary, the hack is a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/1c22400db72d">source-transforming module loader</a>
for Python. It can be used by Python 3 to import a Python 2 source
file while translating certain primitives to their Python 3 equivalents.
It is kind of like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/2to3.html">2to3</a>
except it executes at run-time during <code>import</code>. The main goal of the
hack was to facilitate porting Mercurial to Python 3 while deferring
having to make the most invasive - and therefore most annoying -
elements of the port in the canonical source code representation.</p>
<p>For the technically curious, it works as follows.</p>
<p>The <code>hg</code> Python executable registers a custom
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path">meta path finder</a>
instance. This entity is invoked during <code>import</code> statements to try
to find the module being imported. It tells a later phase of the
import mechanism how to <em>load</em> that module from wherever it is
(usually a <code>.py</code> or <code>.pyc</code> file on disk) to a Python module object.
The custom finder only responds to requests for modules known
to be managed by the Mercurial project. For these modules, it tells
the next stage of the import mechanism to invoke a custom
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.SourceLoader">SourceLoader</a>
instance. Here's where the real magic is: when the custom <em>loader</em>
is invoked, it tokenizes the Python source code using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tokenize.html">tokenize</a> module,
iterates over the token stream, finds specific patterns, and
rewrites them to something <em>more appropriate</em>. It then <em>untokenizes</em>
back to Python source code then falls back to the built-in loader
which does the heavy lifting of compiling the source to Python code
objects. So, we have Python 2 source files on disk that magically get
transformed to be Python compatible when they are loaded by Python 3.
Oh, and there is no performance penalty for the token transformation
on subsequence loads because the transformed bytecode is cached in
the <code>.pyc</code> file (using a custom header so we know it was transformed
and can be invalidated when the transformation logic changes).</p>
<p>At the time I wrote it, the token stream manipulation converted most
string literals (<code>''</code>) to bytes literals (<code>b''</code>). In other words, it
restored the Python 2 behavior of string literals being <code>bytes</code> and
not <code>unicode</code>. We jokingly call it
<code>from __past__ import bytes_literals</code> (a play on Python 2's
<code>from __future__ import unicode_literals</code> special syntax which
changes string literals from Python 2's <code>str</code>/<code>bytes</code> type to
<code>unicode</code> to match Python 3's behavior).</p>
<p>Since I implemented the first version, others have implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/178c89e8519a">Automatically inserting</a>
  a <code>from mercurial.pycompat import ...</code> statement to the top of the
  source. This statement is the Mercurial equivalent of importing
  common wrapper types similar to what
  <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/">six</a> provides.</li>
<li>More robust
  <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/423377290a3a">function argument parsing support</a>.
  (Because going from a token stream to a higher-level primitive like a
  function call is difficult.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/eaaedad68011">Automatically rewriting</a>
  <code>.iteritems()</code> to <code>.items()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As one can expect, when I tweeted a link to this commit, many Python
developers (including a few CPython core developers) expressed a mix
of intrigue and horror. But mostly horror.</p>
<p>I fully concede that what I did here is a gross hack. And, it is the
intention of the Mercurial project to undo this hack and perform a
proper port once Python 3 support in Mercurial is more mature. But, I
want to lay out my defense on why I did this and why the Mercurial
project is tolerant of this ugly hack.</p>
<p>Individuals within the Mercurial project have wanted to port to Python
3 for years. Until recently, it hasn't been a project priority
because a port was too much work for too little end-user gain. And, on
the technical front, a port was just not practical until Python 3.5.
(Two main blockers were no <code>u''</code> literals - restored in Python 3.3 -
and no <code>%</code> formatting for <code>b''</code> literals - restored in 3.5. And as I
understand it, senior members of the Mercurial project had to lobby
Python maintainers pretty hard to get features like <code>%</code> formatting of
<code>b''</code> literals restored to Python 3.)</p>
<p>Anyway, after a number of failed attempts to initiate the Python 3
port over the years, the Mercurial project started making some
positive steps towards Python 3 compatibility, such as switching
to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/">absolute imports</a> and
addressing syntax issues that allowed modules to be parsed into
an AST and even compiled and loadable. These may seem like small
steps, but for a larger project, it was a lot of work.</p>
<p>The porting effort hit a large wall when it came time to actually
make the AST-valid Python code run on Python 3. Specifically, we had
a strings problem.</p>
<p>When you write software that exchanges data between machines -
sometimes machines running different operating systems or having
different encodings - and there is an expectation that things work
the same and data roundtrips accordingly, trying to force text
encodings is essentially impossible and inevitably breaks something or
someone. It is much easier for Mercurial to operate <em>bytes first</em> and
only take text encoding into consideration when absolutely necessary
(such as when emitting bytes to the terminal in the wanted encoding
or when emitting JSON). That's not to say Mercurial ignores the
existence of encodings. Far from it: Mercurial does attempt to
normalize some data to Unicode. But it often does so with a special
Python type that internally stores the raw byte sequence of the
source so that a consumer can choose to operate at the bytes or
Unicode level. </p>
<p>Anyway, this means that practically every string variable in Mercurial
is a <code>bytes</code> type (or something that acts like a <code>bytes</code> type). And
since string literals in Python 3 are the <code>str</code> type (which represents
Unicode), that would mean having to prefix almost every <code>''</code> string
literal in Mercurial with <code>b''</code> in order to placate Python 3. Having
to update every occurrence of simple primitives that could be statically
transformed automatically felt like busy work. <strong>We wanted to spend time
on the meaningful parts of the Python 3 port so we could find
interesting problems and challenges, not toil with mechanical
conversions that add little to no short-term value while simultaneously
increasing cognitive dissonance and quite possibly increasing the odds
of introducing a bug in Python 2.</strong> In other words, why should humans
do the work that machines can do for us? Thus, the source-transforming
module importer was born.</p>
<p>While I concede what Mercurial did is a giant hack, I maintain it was
the correct thing to do. It has allowed the Python 3 port to move
forward without being blocked on the more tedious and invasive
transformations that could introduce subtle bugs (including performance
regressions) in Python 2. Perfect is the enemy of good. People time is
valuable. The source-transforming module importer allowed us to unblock
an important project without sinking a lot of people time into it. I'd
make that trade-off again.</p>
<p>While I won't encourage others to take this approach to porting to
Python 3, if you want to, Mercurial's source is available under a GPL
license and the custom module importer could be adapted to any project
with minimal modifications. If someone does extract it as reusable code,
please leave a comment and I'll update the post to link to it.</p>
