  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>For over a year, AUFS - a layering filesystem for Linux - has been
giving me fits.</p>
<p>As
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1291940">I initially measured last year</a>,
AUFS has... suboptimal performance characteristics. The crux of the problem is
that AUFS obtains a <strong>global</strong> lock in the Linux kernel (at least version 3.13)
for various I/O operations, including <em>stat()</em>. If you have more than a couple
of active CPU cores, the overhead from excessive kernel locking inside
<em>_raw_spin_lock()</em> can add more overhead than extra CPU cores add capacity.
That's right: under certain workloads, adding more CPU cores actually slows
down execution due to cores being starved waiting for a global lock in the
kernel!</p>
<p>If that weren't enough, AUFS can also violate POSIX filesystem guarantees
under load. It appears that AUFS sometimes forgets about created files or
has race conditions that prevent created files from being visible to
readers until many seconds later! I <em>think</em> this issue only occurs when
there are concurrent threads creating files.</p>
<p>These two characteristics of AUFS have inflicted a lot of hardship on
Firefox's continuous integration. Large parts of Firefox's CI execute in
Docker. And the host environment for Docker has historically used Ubuntu
14.04 with Linux 3.13 and Docker using AUFS. AUFS was/is the default
storage driver for many versions of Docker. When this storage driver is
used, all files inside Docker containers are backed by AUFS unless a
Docker <em>volume</em> (a directory bind mounted from the host filesystem - EXT4
in our case) is in play.</p>
<p>When we started using EC2 instances with more CPU cores, we weren't
getting a linear speedup for CPU bound operations. Instead, CPU cycles
were being spent inside the kernel. Stack profiling showed AUFS as the
culprit. We were thus unable to leverage more powerful EC2 instances
because adding more cores would only provide marginal to negative gains
against significant cost expenditure.</p>
<p>We worked around this problem by making heavy use of Docker <em>volumes</em>
for tasks incurring significant I/O. This included version control clones
and checkouts.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we discovered that AUFS volumes were also the
cause of several random <em>file not found</em> errors throughout automation.
Initially, we thought many of these errors were due to bugs in the
underlying tools (Mercurial and Firefox's build system were common
victims because they do lots of concurrent I/O). When the bugs
mysteriously went away after ensuring certain operations were performed
on EXT4 volumes, we were able to blame AUFS for the myriad of filesystem
consistency problems.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we pushed out a change to upgrade Firefox's CI to Linux
4.4 and switched Docker from AUFS to overlayfs (using the <em>overlay2</em> storage
driver). The improvements exceeded my expectations.</p>
<p>Linux build times have decreased by ~4 minutes, from ~750s to ~510s.</p>
<p>Linux Rust test times have decreased by ~4 minutes, from ~615s to ~380s.</p>
<p>Linux PGO build times have decreased by ~5 minutes, from ~2130s to ~1820s.</p>
<p>And this is just the build side of the world. I don't have numbers
off hand, but I suspect many tests also got a nice speedup from this
change.</p>
<p>Multiplied by thousands of tasks per day and factoring in the cost
to operate these machines, the elimination of AUFS has substantially
increased the efficiency (and reliability) of Firefox CI and easily
saved Mozilla tens of thousands of dollars per year. And that's just
factoring in the savings in the AWS bill. Time is money and people
are a lot more expensive than AWS instances (you can run over 3,000
c5.large EC2 instances at spot pricing for what it costs to employ me
when I'm <em>on the clock</em>). So the real win here comes from Firefox
developers being able to move faster because their builds and tests
complete several minutes faster.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you care about performance or filesystem correctness,
avoid AUFS. Use overlayfs instead.</p>
