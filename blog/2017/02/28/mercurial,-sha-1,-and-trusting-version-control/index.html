  <p>The Internet went crazy on Thursday when Google
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">announced a SHA-1 collision</a>.
This has spawned a lot of talk about the impact of SHA-1 in version
control. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Git) weighed in on the
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=148787047422954">Git mailing list</a> and on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/7tp2gYWQugL">Google+</a>.
There are also posts like
<a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2017-February/031623.html">SHA1 collisions make Git vulnerable to attakcs by third-parties, not just repo maintainers</a>
outlining the history of Git and SHA-1. On the Mercurial side,
Matt Mackall (the creator of Mercurial) authored a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">SHA-1 and Mercurial security article</a>.
(If you haven't read Matt's article, please do so now before
continuing.)</p>
<p>I'd like to contribute my own take on the problem with a slant towards
Mercurial and while also comparing Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1
collisions to Git's. Since this is a security topic, I'd like to
explicitly state that I'm not a cryptographer. However, I've worked on
a number of software components that do security/cryptography (like
Firefox Sync) and I'm pretty confident saying that my grasp on
cryptographic primitives and security techniques is better than the
average developer's.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions on a technical
level.</p>
<p>Mercurial, like Git, is <em>vulnerable</em> to SHA-1 collisions. Mercurial is
vulnerable because its logical storage mechanism (like Git's) indexes
tracked content by SHA-1. If two objects with differing content have the
same SHA-1, content under version control could be changed and detecting
that would be difficult or impossible. That's obviously bad.</p>
<p>But, Mercurial's exposure to SHA-1 collisions isn't as severe as Git's.
To understand why, we have to understand how each stores data.</p>
<p>Git's logical storage model is a content-addressable key-value store.
Values (<em>objects</em> in Git parlance) consist of a header identifying the
object type (commit, tree, blob, or tag), the size of the data (as a
string), and the raw content of the thing being stored. Common content
types are file content (blob), a list of files (tree), and a description
of a commit (commit). Keys in this blob store are SHA-1 hashes of objects.
All Git objects go into a single <em>namespace</em> in the Git repository's
<em>store</em>. A beneficial side-effect of this is data de-duplication: if the
same file is added to a Git repository, it's <em>blob</em> object will be
identical and it will only be stored once by Git. A detrimental
side-effect is that hash collisions are possible between any two objects,
irregardless of their type or location in the repository.</p>
<p>Mercurial's logical storage model is also content-addressable. However,
it is significantly different from Git's approach. Mercurial's logical
storage model allocates a separate sub-store for each tracked <em>path</em>.
If you run <code>find .hg/store -name '*.i'</code> inside a Mercurial repository,
you'll see these files. There is a separate file for each path
that has committed data. If you <code>hg add foo.txt</code> and <code>hg commit</code>, there
will be a <code>data/foo.txt.i</code> file holding data for <code>foo.txt</code>.
There are also special files <code>00changelog.i</code> and <code>00manifest.i</code> holding
data for commits/changesets and file lists, respectively. Each of these
<code>.i</code> files - a <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/a185b903bda3/mercurial/help/internals/revlogs.txt">revlog</a> -
is roughly equivalent to an ordered collection of Git objects for a
specific tracked path. This means that Mercurial's store consists of
N discrete and independent namespaces for data. Contrast with Git's
single namespace.</p>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks are the opposite of those pointed out for
Git above: Mercurial doesn't have automatic content-based de-duplication
but it does provide some defense against hash collisions. Because each
logical path is independent of all others, a Mercurial repository will
happily commit two files with different content but same hashes. This
is more robust than Git because a hash collision is isolated to a single
logical path / revlog. In other words, a random file added to the
repository in directory <code>X</code> that has a hash collision with a file in
directory <code>Y</code> won't cause problems.</p>
<p>Mercurial also differs significantly from Git in terms of how the hash
is obtained. Git's hash is computed from raw content preceded by a header
derived directly from the object's role and size. (Takeaway: the header is
static and can be derived trivially.) Mercurial's hash is computed from
raw content preceded by a header. But that header consists of the 20 byte
SHA-1 hash(es) of the parent revisions in the revlog to which the content
is being added. This <em>chaining</em> of hashes means that the header is not
always static nor always trivially derived. This means that the same
content can be stored in the revlog under multiple hashes. It also means
that it is possible to store differing content having a hash collision
within the same revlog! But only under some conditions - Mercurial will
still barf in some scenarios if there is a hash collision within content
tracked by the revlog. This is different from Git's behavior, where the
same content <em>always</em> results in the same Git object hash. (It's worth
noting that a SHA-1 collision on data with a Git object header has not
yet been encountered in the wild.)</p>
<p>The takeaway from the above paragraphs is Mercurial's storage model
is slightly more robust against hash collisions than Git's because there
are multiple, isolated namespaces for storing content and because all
hashes are chained to previous content. So, when SHA-1 collisions
are more achievable and someone manages to create a collision for a
hash used by version control, Mercurial's storage layer will be able
to cope with that better than Git's.</p>
<p>But the concern about SHA-1 weakness is more about security than storage
robustness. The disaster scenario for version control is that an
attacker could replace content under version control, possibly
undetected. If one can generate a hash collision, then this is
possible. Mercurial's chaining of content provides some defense, but
it isn't sufficient.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/mpm/SHA1">Matt Mackall</a>
that at the present time there are bigger concerns with content
safety than SHA-1 collisions. Namely, if you are an attacker, it is
much easier to introduce a subtle bug that contains a security
vulnerability than to introduce a SHA-1 collision. It is also
much easier to hack the canonical version control server (or any
user or automated agent that has permissions to push to the server)
and add a <em>bad</em> commit. Many projects don't have adequate defenses
to detect such <em>bad</em> commits. Ask yourself: if a bad actor pushed
a <em>bad</em> commit to my repository, would it be detected? Keep in mind
that spoofing author and committer metadata in commits is trivial.
<strong>The current state of Mercurial and Git rely primarily on trust -
not SHA-1 hashes - as their primary defense against malicious
actors.</strong></p>
<p>The desire to move away from SHA-1 has been on the radar of the
Mercurial project for years. For 10+ years, the <em>revlog</em> data
structure has allocated 32 bytes for hashes while only using 20 bytes
for SHA-1. And, the topic of SHA-1 weakness and desire to move to
something stronger has come up at the developer <em>sprints</em> for the
past several years. However, it has never been pressing enough to act
on because <em>there are bigger problems</em>. If it were easy to change, then
Mercurial likely would have done it already. But changing is not easy.
As soon as you introduce a new hash format in a repository, you've
potentially locked out all legacy versions of the Mercurial software
from accessing the repository (unless the repository stores multiple
hashes and allows legacy clients to access the legacy SHA-1 hashes).
There are a number of concerns from legacy compatibility (something
Mercurial cares deeply about) to user experience to even performance
(SHA-1 hashing even at 1000+MB/s floats to the top of performance
profiling for some Mercurial operations). I'm sure the topic will be
discussed heavily at the upcoming developers sprint in a few weeks.</p>
<p>While Mercurial should (and will eventually) replace SHA-1, I think
the biggest improvement Mercurial (or Git for that matter) can make
to repository <em>security</em> is providing a better mechanism for tracking
and auditing trust. Existing mechanisms for GPG signing every commit
aren't practical or are a non-starer for many workflows. And, they
rely on GPG, which has notorious end-user usability problems. (I would
prefer my version control tool not subject me to toiling with GPG.)
I've thought about this topic considerably, authoring a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitSigningPlan">proposal for easier and more flexible commit signing</a>.
There is also a related proposal to establish a
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommitCustodyConcept">cryptographically meaningful chain-of-custody for a patch</a>.
There are some good ideas there. But, like all user-facing
cryptography, the devil is in the details. There are some hard
problems to solve, like how to manage/store public keys that were
used for signatures. While there is some prior art in version control
tools (see Monotone), it is far from a solved problem. And at the
end of the day, you are still left having to trust a set of keys
used to produce signatures.</p>
<p>While version control can keep using cryptographically strong hashes
to mitigate collisions within its storage layer to prevent content
swapping and can employ cryptographic signatures of tracked data,
there is still the issue of trust. Version control can give you the
tools for establishing and auditing trust. Version control can also
provide tools for managing trust relationships. But at the end of the
day, the actual act of trusting trust boils down to people making
decisions (possibly through corporate or project policies). This
will always be a weak link. Therefore, it's what malicious actors
will attack. The best your version control tool can do is give its
users the capability and tools to run a secure and verifiable
repository so that when bad content is inevitably added you can't
blame the version control tool for having poor security.</p>
