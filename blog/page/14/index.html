  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I talk to Mozillians who now work at Facebook, they all say
something similar: <em>the tools at Facebook are amazing and put what
Mozilla uses to shame</em>. Having worked at places with decent tools, I
do know that Mozilla is behind the times. So it was easy for me to
dismiss these observations as obvious. But, when you start asking them
about specifics, one tool they are quick to name is
<a href="http://phabricator.org/">Phabricator</a>.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to follow the link, Phabricator is your
all-in-on software engineering web application and platform. It has
issue/bug tracking, code review, repository navigation, wikis, etc. It's
the kitchen sink for software lifecycle management. And, it's open
source and easy to extend. Sounds promising.</p>
<p>After hearing Facebookers rave about Phabricator and having casually
interacted with an instance to review patches to Clang, I was keen
to have a closer look.</p>
<p>So, I spent a lazy afternoon and installed Phabricator on an EC2
instance (connection details below). Having interacted with the
default setup for a few hours, I can say with high confidence
that the Facebookers can back up their claim that Phabricator is
pretty damn amazing. My initial impressions are that it's one of
those tools that's so good that once you start using it, you'll
never tolerate anything subpar again. Again, hearing the
Mozillians-turned-Facebookers opine about Bugzilla, code review,
etc, I think this initial impression might be right.</p>
<p>In the sections below, I'll talk a bit about Phabricator and why I
think it is superior to what Mozilla uses.</p>
<h2>Integrated UI</h2>
<p>One thing I really love about Phabricator is the integrated UI.
Phabricator is essentially a collection of <em>applications</em> tied together
by a single web interface. So, everything is readily available under one
site/domain/service.</p>
<p>This means everything is easier to find. You search for something and
all the different components have their results surfaced. Contrast with
Mozilla as of today, where you need separate searches for Bugzilla,
MXR/DXR, wiki.mozilla.org, etherpad, MDN, etc.</p>
<p>For IT, it means there is only a single service to run and scale. Less
overhead to operate. Less effort to secure.</p>
<h2>Arcanist command line tool</h2>
<p>Phabricator ships with a command line tool called
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Arcanist_User_Guide.html">Arcanist</a>.
It is amazing.</p>
<p>Projects put <em>.arcconfig</em> files under version control which contain the
settings used to configure Arcanist for that project. They essentially
point back towards the Phabricator instance for that project.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with the Arcanism command line interface. Want to
create a code review? <em>arc diff</em>. It opens up an editor and allows you
to fill in details about the review. It then automatically publishes it
for review. No leaving the command line necessary.</p>
<p>You can download and apply patches undergoing code review by
specifying their review identifier. e.g. <em>arc patch D1</em>.</p>
<p>You can create tasks for yourself by running <em>arc todo</em>. The tasks are
uploaded to Phabricator automatically and show up in your dashboard.</p>
<p>If your repo has configured which tests apply to which paths, <em>arc unit</em>
will run all tests impacted by the current patch. (If we ever get around
to annotating this, it would significantly reduce load in automation by
eliminating unnecessary tests.)</p>
<p>There is an <em>arc land</em> command to land patches on the appropriate
landing branch.</p>
<p>Arcanist abstracts the differences between version control systems
pretty well. You can use the same commands for Mercurial, Git, or
Subversion.</p>
<p>Arcanist is pretty nice. It reminds me a lot of mach and what I
originally wanted mach to become with regard to helping to improve
developer workflow.</p>
<h2>Real Code Review</h2>
<p>Phabricator features a real code review tool -
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Differential_User_Guide.html">Differential</a>.</p>
<p>Things like interdiff actually work. It integrates with the code
repository, which means you can expand context right from the
review interface. It can detect blocks
of code that moved between files. It has a nice file tree for navigating
changed files (optional feature). It hides whitespace only changes by
default. You can specify a group of people for review and reviews will
show up in the dashboard of individuals in that group. It has a flag
to say whether a patch underwent <em>linting</em> before upload. (You can
configure linting through Arcanist and have your patches linted before
upload. If you properly deploy linting, style nits all but go away. As I
like to say, every time I write a style nit in code review, my time is
wasted and Mozilla is throwing away part of my salary.)</p>
<p>Mozilla is apparently integrating ReviewBoard into Bugzilla. This is
good. ReviewBoard's review features are infinitely better than Splinter
(Bugzilla's current review interface). However, ReviewBoard is mostly a
standalone tool. What makes Phabricator's approach better is that code
review integrates tightly with everything else. This enables some pretty
awesome scenarios. Keep reading for more.</p>
<h2>Auditing</h2>
<p>An interesting and potentially very useful feature of Phabricator is
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Audit_User_Guide.html">auditing</a>.
Where Differential handles pre-push code review, the Audit
application supports post-push code review. You may say <em>but all changes
at Mozilla must go through pre-push code review - there's no use for
post-push code review</em>. Yes, but post-push review opens up a whole new
realm of possibilities.</p>
<p>It's possible for individual users or projects to set up rules to
automatically trigger audits. For example, as build module owner, I'm
very interested in ensuring people follow the code review policy of
having a build peer review changes to make files. With Phabricator, I
was able to easily configure a rule that automatically creates an audit
every time a make file has changed but it wasn't signed off by a build
peer. Front and center on my dashboard are a list of commits that I
should probably look at. Neat!</p>
<p>Audits are potentially useful for reviews that focus less on code. For
example, Firefox Health Report and Telemetry are two Firefox features
that collect data and send it (anonymously) to Mozilla. Audits could be
used to flag a privacy review when probes are changed. We often don't
want this privacy review to hold up code landing. But we do want to
track that this review occurs before a patch is shipped to our Beta
channel users. I think audits would be great for facilitating this.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a web interface to create new audits. Any individual
can watch anything they have access to. No process involved. Just log in
and create a rule.</p>
<p>Mozilla has audits today, but it isn't user intuitive. They commonly
take the form of Bugzilla keywords or whiteboard entries. Phabricator's
feature is much more powerful.</p>
<h2>Creating rules as a result of actions</h2>
<p>Phabricator has an application called <em>Herald</em> that allows users to
install rules to do something as a result of an action.</p>
<p>For example, I can create a rule against new review requests that will
CC me or automatically add me as a reviewer if a certain file is touched
by a patch.</p>
<p>I can have Phabricator email me whenever a specific user makes a commit
or when a commit touching a specific file is made.</p>
<p>This feature is self-service. You just open the web interface and
program custom rules to your heart's content.</p>
<p>Herald is insanely useful. To my knowledge, Mozilla has nothing quite
like it today. I wish we did. If Mozilla doesn't official deploy
Phabricator, I may continue to run my own personal instance just so I
can have this feature.</p>
<p>Of course, there's an
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Events_User_Guide_Installing_Event_Listeners.html">Event Listener API</a>
so you can write your own events and rules. The sky is literally the
limit here. For example, we could have all uploaded patches
automatically submitted to Try so they run the release automation
gamut. And, we could have Phabricator's background daemons poll for try
results and report them directly in the web interface!</p>
<h2>Module ownership defined inside Phabricator</h2>
<p>Phabricator has a <em>modules</em> concept built into it called
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Owners_Tool_User_Guide.html">Owners</a>. You
create a <em>package</em> that has a single owner and a number of members. This
package can be associated with multiple repositories and individual
paths inside repositories.</p>
<p>The power of this feature is realized when it is integrated with other
components of Phabricator.</p>
<p>For example, there is a checkbox for each <em>package</em> where you can
automatically have Phabricator ensure that a package member is involved
with code review touching files belonging to a package. It will also
automatically report commits not reviewed by members of a package. How
insanely useful is that!</p>
<h2>Other applications and features.</h2>
<p>Phabricator ships with a number of other applications and features.</p>
<p>There's a blogging platform called
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Phame_User_Guide.html">Phame</a>.</p>
<p>There's a simple wiki called
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Phriction_User_Guide.html">Phriction</a>.</p>
<p>There's a simple polling application called
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Slowvote_User_Guide.html">Slowvote</a>.</p>
<p>There's a mechanism to upload and view files.</p>
<p>There's a pastebin-like application called Paste. It integrates with
authentication and authorization, so you can limit the audience of
pastes.</p>
<p>There's a JSON over HTTP API that allows you to do nearly everything.
(I assume this is what Arcanist uses for everything.)</p>
<p>There's a built-in badges mechanism called Tokens.</p>
<p>You can exchange messages and chats with other users (similar to IRC)
using Conpherence.</p>
<p>There is a question and answer application called Ponder. People ask
questions and other people answer them. You can search questions, of
course. This helps build up a searchable knowledge base.</p>
<p>There is a mockups viewing and collaboration tool called Pholio. You can
upload mockups as photos and then annotate images through the web
interface. e.g. you can create a rectangle and ask a question about what
you see in that rectangle.</p>
<p>There is a time tracking application called Phrequent.</p>
<p>Phabricator can receive inbound email to update issues, reviews, etc.
You can even file new bugs via email! Having used an email interface to
Bugzilla at a previous job, I can say from experience this is extremely
useful.</p>
<p>Phabricator allows you to cherry pick which applications you have
enabled. Want just code review and repository browsing without issue
tracking? You can do that.</p>
<h2>Test instance for Mozilla</h2>
<p>As I alluded to above, I have installed an instance of Phabricator on
EC2. My intention for this instance is for Mozillians to start playing
with it and seeing if it's something they'll like.</p>
<p>The test instance is available at
<a href="http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/">http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/</a>.</p>
<p>You can log in using OAuth with one of the configured service providers
or by creating an account. Please note that I'm only serving on plain
HTTP, so your password are sent in the clear.</p>
<p>I have configured a few popular Mozilla repositories with the install.
It's easy to configure new repositories. Send me their info and I'll add
them!</p>
<p>While the web UI is nice, Arcanist is essential to get the most out of
Phabricator. To get <em>arc</em> working with your machine, follow the
<a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/Arcanist_Quick_Start.html">official instructions</a>
to install Arcanist. For your <em>.arcconfig</em> file, use something like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "project_id": "gecko",
  "conduit_uri": "http://phabricator.gregoryszorc.com/"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, have Arcanist fetch authentication credentials:</p>
<pre><code>$ arc install-certificate
</code></pre>
<p>From there, run <em>arc help</em> and see what you can do!</p>
<p>Of course, you'll need to adjust the <em>project_id</em> when appropriate.</p>
<p>When you use this Phabricator instance, please keep the following in
mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm hosting this on my own dime and have the most powerful EC2
  instance I felt like paying out of pocket. That instance sadly isn't
  powerful enough. I installed Phabricator on my desktop at home and it
  flies like a rocket ship. Please don't blame slowness on Phabricator.</li>
<li>I didn't even attempt to tune the HTTP or MySQL servers yet. Expect
  more slowness.</li>
<li>The service and all the data inside could go away at any time. I don't
  have monitoring of the service (yet). <strong>Use at your own risk.</strong></li>
<li>At the time I wrote this, Phabricator was still indexing some
  repositories, notably mozilla-central. Anything interacting with
  source navigation appears to be slow as a result.</li>
<li>The install is effectively a vanilla, out-of-the-box install. Things
  like Mozilla styling could presumably be added. There are likely also
  many sub-par configuration settings. Leave comments and I'll see about
  changing things.</li>
<li>The front page insists on a sign-in. However, I believe all of the
  content should be accessible to the public. Contact me if you know of
  a way to fix this!</li>
<li>This could be hooked up with Persona. I couldn't find a Persona auth
  provider and coding one is beyond my current PHP skills. If someone
  writes one, let me know and I'll install it!</li>
<li>I could hook up authentication against Mozilla's LDAP server. However,
  I don't want your Mozilla credentials going to my personal server nor
  traveling over the wire in the clear.</li>
<li>I'm not an expert on Phabricator. I'll try to help where appropriate.
  But don't count on me being a support desk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next steps at Mozilla</h2>
<p>How should we use Phabricator at Mozilla? Good question!</p>
<p>I encourage people to play around with my personal instance. Upload some
patches. Perform some code reviews. Set up Herald rules to notify you of
repository change events. Just keep in mind that I don't guarantee an
SLA for my instance. So please don't rely on it.</p>
<p>I anticipate that people will come to the conclusion that Phabricator is
awesome and that Mozilla should install an officially supported instance
on a mozilla.org domain with proper hardware. I'll likely be reaching
out to IT shortly to see how feasible that is. But, I imagine it will
get shuffled to the bottom of the priority queue unless people make
noise. If you like Phabricator, tell other people about it. Let your
management chain know how amazing it is. If enough of or the right
people clamor for it, priorities can get changed.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy Phabricator!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Many people ask/complain about Firefox builds being slow. They are slow.
You have every right to complain.</p>
<p>Now in the <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Build_Documentation/index.html">official build system docs</a>
is a <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Build_Documentation/slow.html">page</a>
explaining the major reasons why the build system is slow. I encourage
everyone to read it. If you have any questions, ping me and I'll update
the docs.</p>
<p>Not yet documented there are some new insights we've been getting from
Mike Hommey's <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/4dp9WTQ6F60/9ypVOMk55zkJ">terrific work</a>
to optimize how make traversal works in the current build system.</p>
<p>As part of that work, Mike established a new <em>compile</em> tier in the build
system. This tier compiles C/C++ and little else. Before, C/C++
compiling was interleaved with all the other build steps (install JS
files, xpt processing, etc), so it was somewhat difficult to isolate the
impact of compilation against all other build actions.</p>
<p>Now that we have all compiling happening in one isolated phase, it's pretty
obvious that compiling accounts for the majority of CPU and wall time in
the build system (at least with non no-op builds). We suspected this
before, but we didn't have concrete numbers.</p>
<p>As I've been pulling and rebuilding inbound since this change landed,
it's become increasing clear to me the impact of header dependency hell
on build times. Even simple changesets touching a few .h files are
resulting in hundreds or even thousands of C/C++ files being recompiled.
This increases incremental build times from say 1.5 minutes to often
over 10 minutes.</p>
<p>With Mike Hommey's work, I feel we finally are on a path to make no-op
build times reasonable for many developers. However, until the header
dependency graph is significantly reduced, developers will continue to
see excessively long build times for incremental builds, especially on
pulls. (I notice that my daily inbound pulls take about as long as a
clobber build, which means practically every .cpp file is invalidated
every day due to .h changes.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=785103">great work</a>
has been happening to minimize C/C++ header dependency hell recently.
To everyone working on that, everyone who builds Firefox owes you a
giant <strong>thank you</strong>. However, there's much more that can be done. While
you've made terrific progress, please don't slow down any time soon.</p>

  <p>Do you run Ubuntu and build Firefox? If so, please check out a
mozilla-central revision as of a few hours ago and run <strong>mach
bootstrap</strong>. Among other things, the bootstrapper now installs a modern
version of Mercurial (2.7 at the time I wrote this). Ubuntu currently
ships 2.2.2 in 12.10 and 13.04. It's even worse for older releases.
Mercurial has evolved a lot over the last few months and releases and
I don't think you'll be disappointed after upgrading.</p>
<p>If you don't run Ubuntu, you should still run <strong>mach bootstrap</strong>
periodically to ensure your system has the optimal packages for
developing Firefox.</p>

  <p>Many people have written custom web services related to Mozilla
projects. Cool! However, many of these services live on random hosts
scattered around the internets. These hosts can have frequent downtime,
cost Mozilla contributors time and money to operate, and can be hard to
discover and trust (I don't want to give my LDAP credentials to a
non-Mozilla server).</p>
<p>Did you know Mozilla operates a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
infrastructure that allows Mozillians to host web services and daemons
on the internets (similar to how EC2 works). Until recently, I didn't
either!</p>
<p>If you are a Mozilla employee, learn more about
<a href="https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/websites/paas.allizom.org">paas.allizom.org</a>.
(To non-employees, unfortunately it appears you can't use this yet. And
I'm not sure what the plans for that are.)</p>
<p>This service is actually a Mozilla-hosted <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato">Stackato</a>
instance. You set up your client with your LDAP credentials, provision
services such as PostgreSQL, memcache, MySQL, etc and deploy
applications - either web applications or standalone daemons. The
runtime environment supports nearly everything under the sun - Python,
Node.js, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Java, etc. You write an application, drop a
few files in the project to describe how to deploy it to Stackato, push
it, and <em>it just works.</em> Web applications even get an HTTPS endpoint
with a valid root CA chained certificate!</p>
<p>I recently used this service to power my Django-based
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/automation-dashboard/">automation-dashboard</a>
project. Aside from the initial hurdles figuring out how Django works
(this was the first Django project I've written) and how to hook Django
up to Stackato, I'm pretty impressed with the results. Free web hosting
with database access!</p>
<p>For me, the selling point of this service is that apparently the
transition plan from Stackato-hosted service to IT-managed service is
relatively pain free. Since you must perform all the steps to
isolate/package your application for Stackato, it's relatively easy for
IT to deploy your application.</p>
<p>I encourage Mozillians to look into using this PaaS service for their
Mozilla service hosting needs.</p>

  <p>Have you ever wondered what the machines in Mozilla's automation
infrastructure are doing all the time? I have. So, I decided to create a
visualization of this data. You can find it at
<a href="http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/">http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/</a>.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the visualizations, you notice something:
there's a lot of time when machines aren't doing anything! All that
white space between jobs is time machines are not processing jobs. This
is capacity Mozilla is failing to utilize.</p>
<p>While some may say Mozilla's automation infrastructure has a load or
capacity problem, I say it has an efficiency problem. The average
machine in our automation infrastructure is doing work less than 50% of
the time <em>during weekdays</em>. Now, some of this might be VMs that are
powered off (due to low demand). But considering physical machines are
also under-utilized, I'd say it's a global problem.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't get too hung up with a machine-job efficiency metric.
While important, it's only part of the problem. When jobs are running,
they are typically only using a fraction of the CPU available to them.
From data <a href="/blog/2013/07/14/quantifying-mozilla's-automation-efficiency/">now available in mozharness</a>,
we know that many test suites only use 10-15% CPU. If you combine this
with sub-50% machine utilization in terms of jobs, I estimate we're only
utilizing somewhere between 5-10% of available CPU cycles in our automation
infrastructure. We have a magnitude more capacity in the machines we
already have. <strong>We don't have a capacity problem, we have an efficiency
problem.</strong> In my opinion we should throw less time and money at new
hardware and invest in maximizing the return from what we have.</p>
<h2>Edit 2013-09-03</h2>
<p>I started a thread about this data in another forum and others have
pointed out that the data in this post is incomplete. Notably absent
from this data is when on-demand EC2 instances are shut down, when there
are or aren't jobs scheduled (if jobs aren't scheduled, poor machine
utilization isn't such a big deal), and when some maintainence tasks are
performed (e.g. Panda boards are checked for consistency between jobs).
While we could probably hook job scheduling data up to the graph and
numbers easily, I don't believe data on slave <em>uptime</em> or background
tasks is publicly available. Perhaps we should publish this data to
facilitate deeper analysis.</p>
<p>A goal of this post was to shed light on how little we utilize some of
the machines in our automation infrastructure in order to inspire a
conversation and ultimately to address the perceived problem. It was
not a goal to point fingers and cast blame. If I inadvertently
performed the latter or seemed to jump to conclusions based on
incomplete data, I apologize.</p>
