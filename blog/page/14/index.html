  <h2>Forward</h2>
<p>For reasons I can't explain, I have a keen interest in computer logging
systems. Perhaps it stems from my frustration that such a
seemingly trivial task can often be quite complicated. Perhaps it's from
the scaling challenges inherent with inevitably needing to analyze
terabytes of logged data. Perhaps it's from my experience designing
highly-available distributed server application and needing to use
logging for real-time monitoring and decision making. Whatever the
root causes, I've always wanted to create a brain dump of my thoughts
on logging. So, here we go!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Logging. Practically every computer program does it in some form or
another. The standard libraries for many programming languages provide
a logging facility. But, have you ever stopped to think about the side
effects of logging or why you log the way you do?</p>
<p>In this first post, I will briefly define what I consider logging and
will talk about something called <em>structured logging</em>.</p>
<h2>The Definition of Logging</h2>
<p>For the scope of these posts, I will define logging to be:</p>
<pre><code>An emitted stream of distinct messages from a running application
</code></pre>
<p>A <em>message</em> can be pretty much anything. They are often strings. But,
they could be binary data. The transport mechanism is undefined.
Although, most logging systems typically write to a file (eventually).</p>
<p>I should also call out the difference between <em>reading</em>/<em>interpreting</em>
logs and <em>transporting</em> them. When I say <em>reading a log</em>, I'm referring
to a process where an entity (either human or machine) <em>reads</em> the
individual message content and infers something from it. By contrast, a
<em>transporter</em> treats messages as a black box and just shuffles bits
around. <em>Transporters</em> also typically send or store logging messages
somewhere.</p>
<p>It's worth explicitly noting that this definition encompasses both
tradtional <em>print()</em> based logging (writing a line to a file or output)
as well as things like transaction logs or recording events as new rows
in a database.</p>
<h2>The Multiple Use Cases of Logging</h2>
<p>Before I get to some of the interesting aspects of logging, let's
identify <em>some</em> of the use cases of logging (in no particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording application errors (e.g. exceptions and stack traces)</li>
<li>Low-level information to aid in debugging or human observation</li>
<li>Application monitoring (includes metrics and alerting)</li>
<li>Business analytics (use the logged data to help make decisions)</li>
<li>Security auditing</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's move on to the crux of
this post.</p>
<h2>Logging for Humans or Machines</h2>
<p>I would argue that every log message is intended to be <em>interpreted</em>
by either a human or a machine.</p>
<p>If a log message is only going to be used to help a human debug a system
or casually see what's going on, it's intended for humans. If a log
message is going to be used for machine analysis later (e.g. monitoring,
alerting, business analytics, security auditing, etc), it's intended for
machines.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction. If it isn't clear, please re-read the
prior paragraphs. Now might also be a good time for you to audit the
logs in your life and assign <em>human</em> or <em>machine</em> labels to them.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p><strong>The problem with logging as most of us know it is that it is optimized
for human consumption, even if machines are the intended consumer.</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of most logging systems we log a string, a char *, an
array of characters that can easily be read by humans. For example, a
simple web application might produce log files containing lines like:</p>
<pre><code>2012:11:24T17:32:23.3435 INFO gps@mozilla.com successfully logged in
</code></pre>
<p>Human readability is a great feature to have. However, it comes at a
price: more difficult machine consumption.</p>
<p><strong>By optimizing for human consumption, we've introduced a new problem:
log parsing.</strong></p>
<p>In the above example log message, what the program has done is combined
a few distinct fields of data (an event - <em>logged in</em>, the
username, and the time) into a single text string. This is great for
humans glancing at a log file. But that decision now necessitates
downstream machine consumers to <em>parse</em>/<em>decode</em> that text back into its
original, distinct fields.</p>
<p>I call this style of logging <em>destructured</em> or <em>unstructured</em> logging. We
start with distinct fields of data and then <em>destructure</em> them into a
fully free-form or semi-formed text. By doing so, we lose part
of the original data structure and necessitate the need to reconstruct
it (via parsing).</p>
<p>This seems silly to me.</p>
<p>Why are we formatting distinct fields of data into unified strings only
to have them parsed into their original components again? If lossless
and simple round-trip encoding/decoding is your goal, there are much
better ways than freely-formed text! Going <em>to</em> text is easy
(<em>printf()</em> or string concatenation are how it is commonly performed).
Getting back to the original representation is the real problem.</p>
<p>Every persisted log message destined for machines will need to be decoded
to some degree to facilitate analysis. However, by using destructured
text, nearly every program and logging system forces this decoding
problem onto its users by using an encoding that is difficult to code.</p>
<p>Every time you are analyzing a log file containing destructured text you
need to solve the parsing/decoding problem. Every time you write an
<em>awk</em>, <em>grep</em>, <em>sed</em>, <em>perl</em>, etc script, use regular expressions, etc
to scrape logs you are solving this problem. <strong>How much time do you
spend decoding/parsing logs versus actually doing something useful with
the data?</strong> From my personal experience, a lot. And, parsing
destructured text is a very fragile solution. What happens when the
string changes, even by just a little? Does that throw off your
decoder/parser?</p>
<p>Decoding log messages is a hard problem. Furthermore, it's a problem I'd
rather not have.</p>
<h2>Structured Logging to the Rescue</h2>
<p><img alt="What if I told you there's a better way to log" src="/images/morpheus_logging.jpg" /></p>
<p>One of my early professional mentors taught me that one of the best ways
to solve a problem is to change the requirements so that the problem no
longer exists or becomes easier to solve. (If that didn't immediately
click with you, you might want to read it again because I feel it's an
invaluable skill and one that many engineers don't employ).
Applying that lesson here, how do we eliminate the problem of
parsing destructured textual data back into its original fields?  Simple:
we don't emit destructured text! Instead, we emit data that is easily
machine readable, where each individual field is preserved. <strong>This is
called structured logging.</strong></p>
<p>The primary benefit of structured logging is that you eliminate the
parsing problem (or at least you change it to be a solved problem by
using a common or well-defined encoding format). No tedious searching
for data within free-form text and extracting it. Instead, the fields
from the event-producing application are seamlessly preserved and
loaded into downstream machine consumers.</p>
<h3>A Closer Look</h3>
<p>What does structured logging look like? Well, it depends. There is no
standard for structured logging. When I first started writing this post
in June 2011, a Google search for <em>structured logging</em> didn't yield
much. Today, things aren't that much better. Although, there has been
significant activity in the last 15 months. rsyslog has launched
<a href="http://blog.gerhards.net/2012/02/announcing-project-lumberjack.html">project Lumberjack</a>,
which has structured logging as a pillar. There is even someone sitting
10 ft from me at Mozilla's SF office doing structured logging for server
applications (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Metlog">metlog</a>).</p>
<p>All structured logging systems are different. But, the concepts
are mostly the same.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a log-producing application, a function call to
produce an unstructured message may look something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; successfully logged in&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Whereas a call to produce that same message in structured form may look
like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;successful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">who</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You'll immediately notice that the API retains the original pieces of
data. In this example, we just have the event name (<em>successful_login</em>)
and <em>who</em> (some variable value).</p>
<p>This will look different in every programming language, of course. And,
depending on the structured logging mechanism, the common metadata
produced with each message (e.g. time and log level) may differ. But the
general idea is you preserve the rich data fields as they cross over
into the logging facility rather than <em>casting</em> them to a string.
Behind the scenes, the structured logger retains the fields (the
original structure) and encodes them into something machine readable.</p>
<p>Put another way, structured loggers log objects, not strings.</p>
<p>How objects are encoded again depends on the structured logger
implementation. JSON is a well-understood encoding format. An example
JSON encoding of our example message might look like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">1354317157.034534</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;INFO&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;sucessful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;who&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;gps@mozilla.com&quot;</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That's an array of current time, log level, event name/message type, and
a mapping of the data fields.</p>
<p>Or, you could opt for a more efficient encoding format, such as
protocol buffers (which is binary).</p>
<p>The actual encoding theoretically doesn't really matter as long as it can
easily be decoded back into its original data. A good way to identify this
trait is whether you need to implement a decoder/parser more than once
per programming language or if you need to apply different decoding
mechanisms based on the content of a message. If you do, you probably
don't have a generic enough encoding format.</p>
<p>Going back to implementation details, what about a consumer? In
JavaScript, our JSON structured logger from above might look something
like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">line</span> <span class="nx">of</span> <span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">level</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">action</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fields</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;successful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">who</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fields</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">who</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c1">// Do something interesting.</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;XXX&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this with a destructured parser:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">line</span> <span class="nx">of</span> <span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">endsWith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;successfully logged in&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Find username.</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">spaceIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">spaceIndex</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// Do something interesting.</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(...))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">//</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This example admittedly isn't very complex. But, you can already see
some differences. Notably, it takes 1 line to completely parse <em>any</em>
message using the structured logger. The unstructured text parser
requires multiple lines of code <em>per message type</em>. One of those scales
better than the other.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, it's worth mentioning something about event
names/enumerations. You may notice I gave <em>event name</em> a dedicated
field in my example. This is intentional. In a subsequent post,
I will talk about the importance of event names/enumerations and
schemas. Until then, just assume that having a unique event name is
an important aspect of a well-designed structured logging system.
Hence its inclusion in my examples above.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the vast majority of application logging is done suboptimally
because it forces a <strong>hard</strong> problem of decoding/parsing onto consumers.
Given that many logs are intended for machines, I think this is a
problem that shouldn't need to exist and the software industry should
rethink its current approach to logging by offering first-class
structured logging facilities and subsequently encouraging their use.</p>
<p>If application logging retained the data behind messages, the problem
of parsing/decoding log messages would largely vanish and we would be
left with the real problem: actually doing something useful with
logged data. That is the point of logging after all, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now, this may sound like I'm waiving my hands a bit. You are right:
structured logging by itself is no silver bullet. There are many ways to
do it suboptimally and to use it when you shouldn't. In subsequent posts
to this series, I will dive deeper into how to properly design a
(structured) logging system. I will also investigate some of the
performance implications associated with different logging mechanisms.
Stay tuned.</p>

  <p>If you use mach to build Firefox, there is a chance you may run into
some errors from a change that landed on mozilla-central Wednesday.</p>
<p>I reimplemented the mozconfig finding and loading logic in Python and
with a nice shell wrapper that lets us more easily inspect side-effects
of execution. The overall goal is to speed up mozconfig loading (fewer
shell invocations) as well as to have a strong API for interacting with
mozconfigs so we can do things like better validation. As a side effect,
we now have test coverage of mozconfig behavior!</p>
<p>Anyway, because the logic for mozconfig finding and loading is going
through a completely new mechanism, you may notice some weird behavior.
Until a few minutes ago, $topsrcdir wasn't defined in the execution
environment. This is now fixed. I think most complaints stemmed from
this.</p>
<p>Another significant change is that mozconfig shell scripts are now
executed in a shell that has <em>set -e</em>. This means that failing commands
in your mozconfig will now abort execution. Before, execution would have
silently continued unless you checked the exit code in your mozconfig.
I think this is a change for the better, but it may break your
mozconfigs.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue, please follow the instructions in mach's
output to file a bug. Please attach or link to your mozconfig.</p>

  <p>In case you missed it, I gave a presentation on the state of Firefox's
build system yesterday.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/the-future-of-the-firefox-build-system/">watch</a>
it and <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/presentations/2012-11-29-firefox-build-system/#1">view</a>
the slides online.</p>
<p>If you build Firefox from source regularly, you should definitely at
least skim through the slide deck.</p>
<p>I'm not an HTML expert, so my apogolies for bad UI on the interactive
slides. You may need to press <strong>enter</strong> to select items in
dropdown menus. Also, the interactive slides are a bit resource
intensive. If the slide deck is really slow, turn off those elements.
I've also only tested the slides in Firefox 19 and 20. My apologies if
they don't work everywhere.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Hacking on Firefox is <em>hard</em>. Compiling the source tree for the first
time is a daunting experience. If you manage to do that, you still need
to figure out how to submit patches, write and run tests, etc. There is
no shortage of points where people can get confused, make mistakes, or
just give up because the barrier is too high.</p>
<p>I have strong convictions about making the overall developer experience
better (developers are users too, after all). The easier you make the
developer experience, the greater the chances of retaining developers.
And retaining developers means more contributions: more features and
fewer bugs. This translates to a better state for the Mozilla Project.
This makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Since practically my first day working at Mozilla, I've been
experimenting with ways to make contributing to Firefox easier by
improving the build system or interaction with it.</p>
<p>With a lot of help, I've finally succeeded in landing something into the
Firefox source tree that I think will ultimately lead to a much better
developer experience.</p>
<p>It's called <strong>mach</strong> (German for <em>do</em>) and if you pull the latest
version of <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(Firefox's main source code repository), you can run mach today.</p>
<h2>Running Mach</h2>
<p>You can run Mach by simply executing it from the root directory in the
repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, I shouldn't have to tell you anything else: mach's output
should provide you all the instruction you need to use it. If it
doesn't, that is a bug and it should be fixed.</p>
<p>Realistically, mach is still in early development and its user
experience still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Because technical usage docs belong in a medium that is easily
discoverable and where the community can improve on them (not a
post on a personal blog), you can find additional usage information in
the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/mach">mach article</a> on
MDN. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mach/README.rst">mach README</a>
holds more technical information for people wanting to poke at the inner
workings.</p>
<p>Mach does require Python 2.7. The build system will likely soon require
Python 2.7 as well. So, if you don't have Python 2.7, you should upgrade
now before you lose the ability to build the tree. Conveniently, the
tree now has a
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/09/18/bootstrap-your-system-to-build-firefox">bootstrap script</a>
which covers the installation of Python. So, Python 2.7 should just be a
simple command away.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Why would you use mach? Good question! Compared to the existing
out-of-the-box experience, mach adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run xpcshell and mochitest tests from the source directory.
  This means you can tab-complete test filenames in your shell and it
  <em>just works</em>.</li>
<li>Parsing of compiler warnings (currently supports Clang 3.1 and MSVC
  formats) into a unified warnings database (actually a JSON file).
  After builds you can run <em>./mach warnings-list</em> or <em>./mach
  warnings-summary</em> to get a concise list without having to look at
  build logs.</li>
<li>A single command-line interface where you can easily discover new
  functionality. Just run <em>./mach help</em> (try doing that with make!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Naysayers will say this is a paltry list. They are correct. I have
bigger plans. But, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<h2>Goals and Future Ideas</h2>
<p>The overall goal of mach is to improve the developer experience of
developing Firefox and other Gecko applications. It does this by
providing a convenient, central command in the root directory of
the repository that acts as both an oracle to discover new commands
and functionality (<em>./mach help</em>) as well as a proxy to execute them.
You don't need to worry about environment variables, working directories,
or finding some random script hidden in the bowells of the source tree.
You just run a single command and the world is brought to you. No build
documentation. No outdated wikis. No copying commands into your shell.
No having to scour random blogs for useful tools. You just clone the
repository, run a command, see what you can do, and get stuff done. Your
shell-literate grandmother could do it.</p>
<p>Mach should be your springboard to in-tree developer tools and increased
productivity. You shouldn't need anything except a copy of the source
tree and mach.</p>
<p>Like Git and Mercurial, mach is powered by the concept of
sub-commands/actions. So, one simply needs to register a new sub-command
with the mach driver. This involves writing a Python class. Once you do
that, people can discover and use that functionality. All batteries are
included with a copy of mozilla-central.</p>
<p>As stated above, the current set of commands is rather small. But, the
sky is the limit. Here are some of my ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to upload, download, and apply patches from Bugzilla (Burak
  Yiğit Kaya, Jeff Hammel, Clint Talbert and I have already talked about
  this -- progress tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774141">bug 774141</a>).</li>
<li>Automatically configure Mercurial with optimal settings (ensure user
  info is set, proper lines of diff context, enable mqext, etc). Tracked
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a>.</li>
<li>Submit Try builds. The <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>
  Mercurial extension could easily live as a mach subcommand! Tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774137">bug 774137</a>.</li>
<li>Identify Bugzilla components and/or reviewers from files touched by
  patch. It's all in the history of the touched files and the history of
  the old bugs referenced by those commits!
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774145">Bug 774145</a>.</li>
<li>Interaction with the <em>self-serve</em> build API. That thing on TBPL to
  control individual builds - we could make a CLI interface for it.
  (Steve Fink and/or Jeff Hammel already have
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/josh_joshmatthews.net/self-serve-tools">code</a>
  for this - it just needs to be integrated).
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774147">Bug 774147</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an idea for a feature, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug</a>.
Please note there are many features on file already. However, some
obvious ones such as integration with missing test suites have yet to be
filed (at least at the time I wrote this post).</p>
<p>If you wrote an awesome developer tool and would like others to use it
(without having to rely on people discovering it by reading a corner of the
Internet), add it to mach! Use mach as a wedge to get more exposure and
users. File a bug. I will happily r+ patches that add useful developer
functionality to the tree.</p>
<h2>What this Means / Longer Term Future</h2>
<p>While there is no timetable, mach will eventually replace <em>client.mk</em>.
client.mk, like mach, is essentially a CLI driver for the build
system. Having the driver implemented in Python rather than make has many
compelling advantages. I could probably write a whole post on it, but
I'll spare the world from my ranting.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all means that you may want to start re-training your
muscle memory now. Stop typing <em>make</em> and start typing <em>mach</em>. If you
need to type <em>make</em> because mach does not provide a feature, this is a
missing feature from mach.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">File a bug</a>
and request a new mach feature!</p>
<p>I want to condition people to stop typing <em>make</em>, especially in the object
directory. There are drastic changes to the build system in the works
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841">bug 784841</a> is
the tip of the iceburg). These changes will require the build system to
be treated as a black box. So, things like invoking make from the object
directory will eventually break. You'll need to go through an
intelligent tool to invoke the build system. Mach will be that tool.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I would like to single out the following individuals for helping to land
mach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Hammel for doing the bulk of the reviewing. He shares my vision
  for mach and how it will make the overall developer experience much
  more pleasant and how this will translate to better things for The
  Project. In my mind, Jeff deserves as much credit for landing mach as
  I do.</li>
<li>Mike Hommey and Ms2ger for review help. Mike Hommey helped identify a
  lot of issues with build system integration. Ms2ger provided lots of
  general feedback on Python issues and API design.</li>
<li>Mike Connor (my manager) for allowing me to work on this. It's not
  related to my job description in any way so he <em>could</em> say I shouldn't
  be spending time on this. But, he realizes the positive impact this can
  have and has been supportive of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find mach useful!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>If you've looked at the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build">build instructions</a>
for Firefox lately, you may have noticed something new: support for
system bootstrapping!</p>
<p>Now checked in to mozilla-central is a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozboot/">framework</a>
for ensuring your system is capable of building mozilla-central and
Firefox. You just need to download and run a single Python script and it
performs magic.</p>
<p>Kudos go out to a community contributor, kmm (name wasn't revealed) for
doing the legwork for tracking down and verifying things worked on all
the Linux distros. Richard Newman and Jeff Hammel also helped with code
reviews. Just hours after it landed, Landry Breuil contributed support
for OpenBSD!</p>
<p>Currently, bootstrapping works for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>CentOS 6.x</li>
<li>Fedora</li>
<li>OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add support for an additional OS, please file a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">Core : Build Config</a>
bug. Likewise, if you encounter an issue, please file a bug so others
don't get tripped up by it!</p>
<p>Bootstrap support is definitely in its infancy. It still needs features
like better prompting and opportunities for user choice (e.g. support
MacPorts on OS X - currently it only works with Homebrew). But, I think
it is much better than what existed previously, especially on OS X.</p>
<p>I consider this bootstrapping component just one piece in a larger
mission to make developing and building Firefox (and other Gecko
applications) easier. This should (hopefully) lead to more development
involvement. The next component to land will likely be
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/07/25/mozilla-build-system-plan-of-attack">mach</a>.
It's (finally) been getting some review love (thanks Jeff Hammel!), so
I'm optimistic it will land in the next few weeks.</p>
