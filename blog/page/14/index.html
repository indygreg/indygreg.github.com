  <p>Do you run Ubuntu and build Firefox? If so, please check out a
mozilla-central revision as of a few hours ago and run <strong>mach
bootstrap</strong>. Among other things, the bootstrapper now installs a modern
version of Mercurial (2.7 at the time I wrote this). Ubuntu currently
ships 2.2.2 in 12.10 and 13.04. It's even worse for older releases.
Mercurial has evolved a lot over the last few months and releases and
I don't think you'll be disappointed after upgrading.</p>
<p>If you don't run Ubuntu, you should still run <strong>mach bootstrap</strong>
periodically to ensure your system has the optimal packages for
developing Firefox.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Many people have written custom web services related to Mozilla
projects. Cool! However, many of these services live on random hosts
scattered around the internets. These hosts can have frequent downtime,
cost Mozilla contributors time and money to operate, and can be hard to
discover and trust (I don't want to give my LDAP credentials to a
non-Mozilla server).</p>
<p>Did you know Mozilla operates a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
infrastructure that allows Mozillians to host web services and daemons
on the internets (similar to how EC2 works). Until recently, I didn't
either!</p>
<p>If you are a Mozilla employee, learn more about
<a href="https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/websites/paas.allizom.org">paas.allizom.org</a>.
(To non-employees, unfortunately it appears you can't use this yet. And
I'm not sure what the plans for that are.)</p>
<p>This service is actually a Mozilla-hosted <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato">Stackato</a>
instance. You set up your client with your LDAP credentials, provision
services such as PostgreSQL, memcache, MySQL, etc and deploy
applications - either web applications or standalone daemons. The
runtime environment supports nearly everything under the sun - Python,
Node.js, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Java, etc. You write an application, drop a
few files in the project to describe how to deploy it to Stackato, push
it, and <em>it just works.</em> Web applications even get an HTTPS endpoint
with a valid root CA chained certificate!</p>
<p>I recently used this service to power my Django-based
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/automation-dashboard/">automation-dashboard</a>
project. Aside from the initial hurdles figuring out how Django works
(this was the first Django project I've written) and how to hook Django
up to Stackato, I'm pretty impressed with the results. Free web hosting
with database access!</p>
<p>For me, the selling point of this service is that apparently the
transition plan from Stackato-hosted service to IT-managed service is
relatively pain free. Since you must perform all the steps to
isolate/package your application for Stackato, it's relatively easy for
IT to deploy your application.</p>
<p>I encourage Mozillians to look into using this PaaS service for their
Mozilla service hosting needs.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Have you ever wondered what the machines in Mozilla's automation
infrastructure are doing all the time? I have. So, I decided to create a
visualization of this data. You can find it at
<a href="http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/">http://automation-dashboard.paas.allizom.org/</a>.</p>
<p>When you start looking at the visualizations, you notice something:
there's a lot of time when machines aren't doing anything! All that
white space between jobs is time machines are not processing jobs. This
is capacity Mozilla is failing to utilize.</p>
<p>While some may say Mozilla's automation infrastructure has a load or
capacity problem, I say it has an efficiency problem. The average
machine in our automation infrastructure is doing work less than 50% of
the time <em>during weekdays</em>. Now, some of this might be VMs that are
powered off (due to low demand). But considering physical machines are
also under-utilized, I'd say it's a global problem.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't get too hung up with a machine-job efficiency metric.
While important, it's only part of the problem. When jobs are running,
they are typically only using a fraction of the CPU available to them.
From data <a href="/blog/2013/07/14/quantifying-mozilla's-automation-efficiency/">now available in mozharness</a>,
we know that many test suites only use 10-15% CPU. If you combine this
with sub-50% machine utilization in terms of jobs, I estimate we're only
utilizing somewhere between 5-10% of available CPU cycles in our automation
infrastructure. We have a magnitude more capacity in the machines we
already have. <strong>We don't have a capacity problem, we have an efficiency
problem.</strong> In my opinion we should throw less time and money at new
hardware and invest in maximizing the return from what we have.</p>
<h2>Edit 2013-09-03</h2>
<p>I started a thread about this data in another forum and others have
pointed out that the data in this post is incomplete. Notably absent
from this data is when on-demand EC2 instances are shut down, when there
are or aren't jobs scheduled (if jobs aren't scheduled, poor machine
utilization isn't such a big deal), and when some maintainence tasks are
performed (e.g. Panda boards are checked for consistency between jobs).
While we could probably hook job scheduling data up to the graph and
numbers easily, I don't believe data on slave <em>uptime</em> or background
tasks is publicly available. Perhaps we should publish this data to
facilitate deeper analysis.</p>
<p>A goal of this post was to shed light on how little we utilize some of
the machines in our automation infrastructure in order to inspire a
conversation and ultimately to address the perceived problem. It was
not a goal to point fingers and cast blame. If I inadvertently
performed the latter or seemed to jump to conclusions based on
incomplete data, I apologize.</p>

  <p>I'm a big fan of tools that encourage and/or enforce the following of
best practices and that help people become more productive.</p>
<p>One of the tools that Firefox developers interact with nearly daily is
Mercurial. As I've observed from coworkers and from community
contributors, many don't have Mercurial configured for optimal
development. For first-time contributors, this can manifest in patch
rejection - an experience that can be embarassing and demotivating. This
is frustrating to me because most issues are easily identifiable and
correctable. And, when addressed, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pleased to announce that there is now a configuration wizard
in the Firefox source tree to help with configuring Mercurial. To run it,
just type:</p>
<pre><code>./mach mercurial-setup
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, it's aimed for first-time contributors. So, it's missing
things that more seasoned developers rely on. But you need to start
somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Currently, the tool isn't advertised anywhere other than <em>mach help</em>.
Please run it and report issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a> or
file a new report. Once things have baked in, I'd like to add some kind
of notification/tips system to mach where it will encourage you to do
things like automatically run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>. Until then, I
recommend trying to remember to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> every few
weeks to ensure your Mercurial environment is up to date and properly
configured.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Nick Alexander for sharing my enthusiasm for helping
contributors and for taking the time to review this work.</p>

  <p>My <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/mozext">Mercurial extension for Firefox development</a>
now has an initial implementation of pushlog aggregation and searching.</p>
<p>You first start by synchronizing the pushlog data on Mozilla's servers
with the local client:</p>
<pre><code>hg pushlogsync
</code></pre>
<p>This takes a while the first time you run it because it has to download
all the data. On subsequent runs, it only downloads new data, so it
should be much faster.</p>
<p>Then, you can search for the push history of a changeset:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre>$ hg changesetpushes -a b968708558b9

Note that this patch depends on signed integer overflow behavior in C++,
which I believe is portable despite being unspecified.

<p>(The <em>-a</em> argument prints all trees instead of just the release trees).</p>
<p>I'd like to integrate bug tracking into the mix to facilitate
answering questions like <em>when did bug 123456 ride the trains</em>.</p>
<p>I'd also like to integrate release versions and build IDs into the mix.
For example, when I look up a changeset, I want to know the first build
on the Nightly, Aurora, Beta, and Release channels that change was
included in.</p>
