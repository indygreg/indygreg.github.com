  <p>If you use mach to build Firefox, there is a chance you may run into
some errors from a change that landed on mozilla-central Wednesday.</p>
<p>I reimplemented the mozconfig finding and loading logic in Python and
with a nice shell wrapper that lets us more easily inspect side-effects
of execution. The overall goal is to speed up mozconfig loading (fewer
shell invocations) as well as to have a strong API for interacting with
mozconfigs so we can do things like better validation. As a side effect,
we now have test coverage of mozconfig behavior!</p>
<p>Anyway, because the logic for mozconfig finding and loading is going
through a completely new mechanism, you may notice some weird behavior.
Until a few minutes ago, $topsrcdir wasn't defined in the execution
environment. This is now fixed. I think most complaints stemmed from
this.</p>
<p>Another significant change is that mozconfig shell scripts are now
executed in a shell that has <em>set -e</em>. This means that failing commands
in your mozconfig will now abort execution. Before, execution would have
silently continued unless you checked the exit code in your mozconfig.
I think this is a change for the better, but it may break your
mozconfigs.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue, please follow the instructions in mach's
output to file a bug. Please attach or link to your mozconfig.</p>

  <p>In case you missed it, I gave a presentation on the state of Firefox's
build system yesterday.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://air.mozilla.org/the-future-of-the-firefox-build-system/">watch</a>
it and <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/presentations/2012-11-29-firefox-build-system/#1">view</a>
the slides online.</p>
<p>If you build Firefox from source regularly, you should definitely at
least skim through the slide deck.</p>
<p>I'm not an HTML expert, so my apogolies for bad UI on the interactive
slides. You may need to press <strong>enter</strong> to select items in
dropdown menus. Also, the interactive slides are a bit resource
intensive. If the slide deck is really slow, turn off those elements.
I've also only tested the slides in Firefox 19 and 20. My apologies if
they don't work everywhere.</p>

<a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>, <a href='/blog/category/firefox'>Firefox</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Hacking on Firefox is <em>hard</em>. Compiling the source tree for the first
time is a daunting experience. If you manage to do that, you still need
to figure out how to submit patches, write and run tests, etc. There is
no shortage of points where people can get confused, make mistakes, or
just give up because the barrier is too high.</p>
<p>I have strong convictions about making the overall developer experience
better (developers are users too, after all). The easier you make the
developer experience, the greater the chances of retaining developers.
And retaining developers means more contributions: more features and
fewer bugs. This translates to a better state for the Mozilla Project.
This makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Since practically my first day working at Mozilla, I've been
experimenting with ways to make contributing to Firefox easier by
improving the build system or interaction with it.</p>
<p>With a lot of help, I've finally succeeded in landing something into the
Firefox source tree that I think will ultimately lead to a much better
developer experience.</p>
<p>It's called <strong>mach</strong> (German for <em>do</em>) and if you pull the latest
version of <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(Firefox's main source code repository), you can run mach today.</p>
<h2>Running Mach</h2>
<p>You can run Mach by simply executing it from the root directory in the
repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, I shouldn't have to tell you anything else: mach's output
should provide you all the instruction you need to use it. If it
doesn't, that is a bug and it should be fixed.</p>
<p>Realistically, mach is still in early development and its user
experience still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Because technical usage docs belong in a medium that is easily
discoverable and where the community can improve on them (not a
post on a personal blog), you can find additional usage information in
the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/mach">mach article</a> on
MDN. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mach/README.rst">mach README</a>
holds more technical information for people wanting to poke at the inner
workings.</p>
<p>Mach does require Python 2.7. The build system will likely soon require
Python 2.7 as well. So, if you don't have Python 2.7, you should upgrade
now before you lose the ability to build the tree. Conveniently, the
tree now has a
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/09/18/bootstrap-your-system-to-build-firefox">bootstrap script</a>
which covers the installation of Python. So, Python 2.7 should just be a
simple command away.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Why would you use mach? Good question! Compared to the existing
out-of-the-box experience, mach adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run xpcshell and mochitest tests from the source directory.
  This means you can tab-complete test filenames in your shell and it
  <em>just works</em>.</li>
<li>Parsing of compiler warnings (currently supports Clang 3.1 and MSVC
  formats) into a unified warnings database (actually a JSON file).
  After builds you can run <em>./mach warnings-list</em> or <em>./mach
  warnings-summary</em> to get a concise list without having to look at
  build logs.</li>
<li>A single command-line interface where you can easily discover new
  functionality. Just run <em>./mach help</em> (try doing that with make!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Naysayers will say this is a paltry list. They are correct. I have
bigger plans. But, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<h2>Goals and Future Ideas</h2>
<p>The overall goal of mach is to improve the developer experience of
developing Firefox and other Gecko applications. It does this by
providing a convenient, central command in the root directory of
the repository that acts as both an oracle to discover new commands
and functionality (<em>./mach help</em>) as well as a proxy to execute them.
You don't need to worry about environment variables, working directories,
or finding some random script hidden in the bowells of the source tree.
You just run a single command and the world is brought to you. No build
documentation. No outdated wikis. No copying commands into your shell.
No having to scour random blogs for useful tools. You just clone the
repository, run a command, see what you can do, and get stuff done. Your
shell-literate grandmother could do it.</p>
<p>Mach should be your springboard to in-tree developer tools and increased
productivity. You shouldn't need anything except a copy of the source
tree and mach.</p>
<p>Like Git and Mercurial, mach is powered by the concept of
sub-commands/actions. So, one simply needs to register a new sub-command
with the mach driver. This involves writing a Python class. Once you do
that, people can discover and use that functionality. All batteries are
included with a copy of mozilla-central.</p>
<p>As stated above, the current set of commands is rather small. But, the
sky is the limit. Here are some of my ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to upload, download, and apply patches from Bugzilla (Burak
  Yiğit Kaya, Jeff Hammel, Clint Talbert and I have already talked about
  this -- progress tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774141">bug 774141</a>).</li>
<li>Automatically configure Mercurial with optimal settings (ensure user
  info is set, proper lines of diff context, enable mqext, etc). Tracked
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a>.</li>
<li>Submit Try builds. The <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>
  Mercurial extension could easily live as a mach subcommand! Tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774137">bug 774137</a>.</li>
<li>Identify Bugzilla components and/or reviewers from files touched by
  patch. It's all in the history of the touched files and the history of
  the old bugs referenced by those commits!
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774145">Bug 774145</a>.</li>
<li>Interaction with the <em>self-serve</em> build API. That thing on TBPL to
  control individual builds - we could make a CLI interface for it.
  (Steve Fink and/or Jeff Hammel already have
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/josh_joshmatthews.net/self-serve-tools">code</a>
  for this - it just needs to be integrated).
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774147">Bug 774147</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an idea for a feature, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug</a>.
Please note there are many features on file already. However, some
obvious ones such as integration with missing test suites have yet to be
filed (at least at the time I wrote this post).</p>
<p>If you wrote an awesome developer tool and would like others to use it
(without having to rely on people discovering it by reading a corner of the
Internet), add it to mach! Use mach as a wedge to get more exposure and
users. File a bug. I will happily r+ patches that add useful developer
functionality to the tree.</p>
<h2>What this Means / Longer Term Future</h2>
<p>While there is no timetable, mach will eventually replace <em>client.mk</em>.
client.mk, like mach, is essentially a CLI driver for the build
system. Having the driver implemented in Python rather than make has many
compelling advantages. I could probably write a whole post on it, but
I'll spare the world from my ranting.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all means that you may want to start re-training your
muscle memory now. Stop typing <em>make</em> and start typing <em>mach</em>. If you
need to type <em>make</em> because mach does not provide a feature, this is a
missing feature from mach.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">File a bug</a>
and request a new mach feature!</p>
<p>I want to condition people to stop typing <em>make</em>, especially in the object
directory. There are drastic changes to the build system in the works
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841">bug 784841</a> is
the tip of the iceburg). These changes will require the build system to
be treated as a black box. So, things like invoking make from the object
directory will eventually break. You'll need to go through an
intelligent tool to invoke the build system. Mach will be that tool.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I would like to single out the following individuals for helping to land
mach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Hammel for doing the bulk of the reviewing. He shares my vision
  for mach and how it will make the overall developer experience much
  more pleasant and how this will translate to better things for The
  Project. In my mind, Jeff deserves as much credit for landing mach as
  I do.</li>
<li>Mike Hommey and Ms2ger for review help. Mike Hommey helped identify a
  lot of issues with build system integration. Ms2ger provided lots of
  general feedback on Python issues and API design.</li>
<li>Mike Connor (my manager) for allowing me to work on this. It's not
  related to my job description in any way so he <em>could</em> say I shouldn't
  be spending time on this. But, he realizes the positive impact this can
  have and has been supportive of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find mach useful!</p>

  <p>If you've looked at the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build">build instructions</a>
for Firefox lately, you may have noticed something new: support for
system bootstrapping!</p>
<p>Now checked in to mozilla-central is a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozboot/">framework</a>
for ensuring your system is capable of building mozilla-central and
Firefox. You just need to download and run a single Python script and it
performs magic.</p>
<p>Kudos go out to a community contributor, kmm (name wasn't revealed) for
doing the legwork for tracking down and verifying things worked on all
the Linux distros. Richard Newman and Jeff Hammel also helped with code
reviews. Just hours after it landed, Landry Breuil contributed support
for OpenBSD!</p>
<p>Currently, bootstrapping works for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>CentOS 6.x</li>
<li>Fedora</li>
<li>OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add support for an additional OS, please file a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">Core : Build Config</a>
bug. Likewise, if you encounter an issue, please file a bug so others
don't get tripped up by it!</p>
<p>Bootstrap support is definitely in its infancy. It still needs features
like better prompting and opportunities for user choice (e.g. support
MacPorts on OS X - currently it only works with Homebrew). But, I think
it is much better than what existed previously, especially on OS X.</p>
<p>I consider this bootstrapping component just one piece in a larger
mission to make developing and building Firefox (and other Gecko
applications) easier. This should (hopefully) lead to more development
involvement. The next component to land will likely be
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/07/25/mozilla-build-system-plan-of-attack">mach</a>.
It's (finally) been getting some review love (thanks Jeff Hammel!), so
I'm optimistic it will land in the next few weeks.</p>

  <small>August 28, 2012 at 12:00 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>, <a href='/blog/category/firefox'>Firefox</a>, <a href='/blog/category/build-system'>build system</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have very alpha support for Visual Studio project generation for
mozilla-central that daring people can dogfood.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that this is extremely alpha. Normally, I wouldn't
release things as fragile as they are. But, I know Windows developers
sorely miss Visual Studio, especially IntelliSense. The current Visual
Studio projects support IntelliSense, so I want to get this in the hands
of Windows developers ASAP.</p>
<p>The current directions for making this all work are a bit hacky. Things
will change once things have matured. For now, please excuse the mess.</p>
<p>First, you will need to grab the code. If you use Git, set up a remote
to my repository:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add indygreg git://github.com/indygreg/mozilla-central.git
git fetch indygreg
</code></pre>
<p>The branch of interest is <em>build-splendid</em>. I periodically rebase this
branch on top of master. You have been warned.</p>
<p>You can switch to this branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b build-splendid indygreg/build-splendid
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can squash it down to a single commit and merge it
into your local branch. Once you've done that, you can record the SHA-1
of the commit and cherry-pick that wherever you like!</p>
<pre><code>git merge --squash indygreg/build-splendid
git commit
</code></pre>
<p>In the current state, you need to build the tree or the Visual Studio
projects will complain about missing files. It doesn't matter if you
build the tree before or after Visual Studio projects are generated.
But, we might as well get it out of the way. From your MozillaBuild
environment, run:</p>
<pre><code>./mach build
</code></pre>
<p>That should <em>just work</em>. If it doesn't, you may need to configure
mach.ini. See my <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/08/15/build-firefox-faster-with-build-splendid/">previous post</a>
on how to configure mach.ini. As a reference, my Windows config is:</p>
<pre><code>[build]

configure_extra = --disable-webgl

[compiler]

[paths]
source_directory = c:\dev\src\mozilla-central-git
object_directory = c:\dev\src\mozilla-central-git\objdir
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to generate Visual Studio project files:</p>
<pre><code>./mach backendconfig visualstudio
</code></pre>
<p>That should take about a minute to finish. When it's done, it should
have created <em>objdir/msvc/mozilla.sln</em>. You should be able to load that
in Visual Studio!</p>
<p>You will need to regenerate Visual Studio project files when the build
config changes. As a rule of thumb, do this every time you pull source.
You don't need to perform a full build before you generate Visual Studio
files (you do need to perform configure, however). However, if you have
not performed a full build, Visual Studio may not be able to find some
files, like headers generated from IDLs.</p>
<p><strong>Please close the solution before regenerating the project files.</strong> If
you don't, Visual Studio puts up a modal dialog for each project file
that changed and you have to click through over a hundred of these. It's
extremely frustrating. I'm investigating workarounds.</p>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>Currently, it only generates projects for C/C++ compilation (libraries).
I still need to add support for IDL, headers, etc. However, each
project has proper compiler flags, header search paths, etc. So,
IntelliSense is happy and some things do manage to compile!</p>
<p>Many parts are broken and sub-par.</p>
<p>I've only tested on Visual Studio 2008. If you are running Visual Studio
\2010, you can try to upgrade the solution. This <em>may</em> work. The backend
supports generating solutions for different versions. But, I haven't
tested things work on non-2008 and I don't want to expose untested behavior.</p>
<p>Compiling within Visual Studio works for some things. On my system, I
get a lot of <em>nullptr not defined</em> errors. I'm not sure why. This will
hopefully be worked out soon.</p>
<p>If you do manager to compile within Visual Studio, the output files
don't go in the right places. So, if you do a build from the
command-line, it will have to re-compile to pick up changes.</p>
<p>Project names are based on the name of the library they produce. I'm not
sure if this is the best solution.</p>
<p>Project dependencies are not set up. They will be added later.</p>
<p>Projects for linking libxul or building firefox.exe are not yet
provided. Along the same vein, debugging support is not built-in. I'm
working on it.</p>
<p>Basically, IntelliSense works. You can now use Visual Studio as a rich
editor. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I'm anxious to hear if this works for other people. Please leave
comments!</p>
