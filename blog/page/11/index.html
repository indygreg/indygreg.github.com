  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Of of my first tasks in my
<a href="/blog/2014/09/05/new-job-role/">new role</a> as a <em>Developer Productivity
Engineer</em> is to help make Mozilla's Mercurial server better. Many of the
awesome things we have planned rely on features in newer versions of
Mercurial. It's therefore important for us to upgrade our Mercurial
server to a modern version (we are currently running 2.5.4) and to keep
our Mercurial server upgraded as time passes.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why we haven't historically upgraded our
Mercurial server. First, as anyone who has maintained high-availability
systems will tell you, there is the attitude of <em>if it isn't broken,
don't fix it.</em> In other words, Mercurial 2.5.4 is working fine, so why
mess with a good thing. This was all fine and dandy - until Mercurial
started falling over in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>But the blocker towards upgrading that I want to talk about today is
systems verification. There has been extreme caution around upgrading
Mercurial at Mozilla because it is a critical piece of Mozilla's
infrastructure and if the upgrade were to not go well, the outage
would be disastrous for developer productivity and could even jeopardize
an emergency Firefox release.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like to say that a modern version of Mercurial on the
server would be a drop-in replacement (Mercurial has a great committment
to backwards compatibility and has loose coupling between clients and
servers such that upgrading servers should not impact clients), there is
always a risk that something will change. And that risk is compounded by
the amount of custom code we have running on our server.</p>
<p>The way you protect against unexpected changes is testing. In the ideal
world, you have a robust test suite that you run against a staging
instance of a service to validate that any changes have no impact. In
the absence of testing, you are left with fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
FUD is an especially horrible philosophy when it comes to managing
servers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have a great testing infrastructure for
Mozilla's Mercurial server. And I want to change that.</p>
<h2>Reproducing the Server Environment</h2>
<p>When writing tests, it is important for the thing being tested to be as
similar as possible to the real thing. This is why so many people have
an aversion to mocking: every time you alter the test environment, you run
the risk that those differences from reality will mask changes seen in
the real environment.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that a good first goal for creating a test suite against
our Mercurial server should be to reproduce the production server and
environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a Vagrant environment that attempts to
reproduce the official environment as closely as possible. It starts
one virtual machine for the SSH/master server. It starts a separate
virtual machine for the hgweb/slave servers. The virtual machines are
booting CentOS. This is different than production, where we run RHEL.
But they are similar enough (and can share the same packages) that the
differences shouldn't matter too much, at least for now.</p>
<h2>Using Puppet</h2>
<p>In production, Mozilla is using Puppet to manage the Mercurial servers.
Unfortunately, the actual Puppet configs that Mozilla is running are
behind a firewall, mainly for security reasons. This is potentially
a huge setback for my reproducibility effort, as I'd like to have
my virtual machines use the same exact Puppet configs as whats used
in production so the environments match as closely as possible. This
would also save me a lot of work from having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ben Kero has extracted the Mercurial-relevant Puppet
config files into a
<a href="https://github.com/bkero/puppet-module-hg">standalone repository</a>.
Apparently that repository gets rolled into the production Puppet
configs periodically. So, my virtual machines and production can share
the same Mercurial Puppet files. Nice!</p>
<p>It wasn't long after starting to use the standalone Puppet configs that
I realized this would be a rabbit hole. This first manifests in the
standalone Puppet code referencing things that exist in the hidden
Mozilla Puppet files. So the liberation was only partially successful.
Sad panda.</p>
<p>So, I'm now in the process of creating a <em>fake Mozilla</em> Puppet
environment that mimics the base Mozilla environment (from the closed
repo) and am modifying the shared Puppet Mercurial code to work with
both versions. This is a royal pain, but it needs to be done if we want
to reproduce production and maintain peace of mind that test results
reflect reality.</p>
<p>Because reproducing runtime environments is important for reproducing
and solving bugs and for testing, <strong>I call on the maintainers of
Mozilla's closed Puppet repository to liberate it from behind its
firewall</strong>. I'd like to see a public Puppet configuration tree available
for all to use so that anyone anywhere can reproduce the state of a
server or service operated by Mozilla to within reasonable
approximation. Had this already been done, it would have saved me hours
of work. As it stands, I'm reverse engineering systems and trying to
cobble together understanding of how the Mozilla Puppet configs
work and what parts of them can safely be ignored to reproduce an
approximate testing environment.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I finally got access to Mozilla's internal Puppet
repository. This took a few meetings and apparently a lot of
backroom chatter was generated - "developer's don't normally get access,
oh my!" All I wanted was to see how systems are configured so I can
help improve them. Instead, getting access felt like pulling teeth.
This feels like a major roadblock towards productivity, reproducibility,
and testing.</p>
<p>Facebook gives its developers access to most production machines and
trusts them to not be stupid. I know we (Mozilla) like to hold
ourselves to a high standard of security and privacy. But not giving
developers access to the configurations for the systems their code
runs on feels like a very silly policy. I hope Mozilla invests in
opening up this important code and data, if not to the world, at least
to its trusted employees.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully I'll soon have a Vagrant environment that allows
people to build a standalone instance of Mozilla's Mercurial server.
And once that's in place, I can start writing tests that basic services
and workflows (including repository syncing) work as expected. Stay
tuned.</p>

  <p>As of today, I have a new role and title at Mozilla: <em>Developer
Productivity Engineer</em>. I'll be reporting to Laura Thomson as a
member of the <em>Developer Services</em> team.</p>
<p>I have an immediate goal to make our version control work better.
This includes making Try scale and helping out with the deployment
of ReviewBoard. After that, I'm not entirely sure. But Autoland
and Firefox build system improvements have been discussed.</p>
<p>I'm really excited to be in this new role. If someone were to give me
a clean slate and tell me to design my own job role, I think I'd
answer with something very similar to the role I am now in. I am
passionate about tools and enabling people to become more productive.
I have little doubt I'll thrive in this new role.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mozilla has a number of source repositories under
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/">https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/</a>
that cumulatively define how version control works at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Back in February, I
<a href="/blog/2014/02/05/new-repository-for-mozilla-version-control-tools/">launched an effort</a>
to establish a unified Mercurial repository for all this code. That
repository is <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
and it has slowly grown.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052201">latest addition</a>
to this repository is the import of the <em>hghooks</em> repository. This
now-defunct repository contained all the server-side Mercurial hooks
that Mozilla has deployed on <em>hg.mozilla.org</em>.</p>
<p>Soon after that repository was imported into version-control-tools, we
started executing the hooks tests as part of the existing test suite in
version-control-tools. This means we get
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/">continuous integration</a>,
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/coveragepy/?">code coverage</a>,
and the ability to run tests against multiple versions of Mercurial
(2.5.4 through 3.1) in one go.</p>
<p><strong>This is new for Mozilla and is a big deal.</strong> For the first time, we
have a somewhat robust testing environment for Mercurial that is testing
things we run in production.</p>
<p>But we still have a long way to go. The ultimate goal is to get everything
rolled into the version-control-tools repository and to write tests for
everything people rely on. We also want the test environment to look as
much like our production environment as possible. Once that's in place,
most of the fear and uncertainty around upgrading or changing the server
goes away. This will allow Mozilla to move faster and issues like our
recent server problems can be diagnosed more quickly (Mercurial has
added better logging in newer versions).</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to this effort, <strong>please write tests for
behavior you rely on.</strong> We're now relying on Mercurial's test harness
and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests">test types</a>
rather than low-level unit tests. This means our tests are now running
a Mercurial server and running actual Mercurial commands. The tests thus
explicitly verify that client-seen behavior is exactly as you intend.
For an example, see the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/abc1c5bdca9b/hghooks/tests/test-prevent-webidl.t">WebIDL hook test</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Find some gaps in code coverage and write
some tests today!</p>

  <p>Hey there, Firefox developer! Do you use Mercurial? Please take the time
right now to run <strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> from your Firefox clone.</p>
<p>It's been updated to ensure you are running a modern Mercurial version.
More awesomely, it has support for a couple of new extensions to make
you more productive. I think you'll like what you see.</p>
<p><strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> doesn't change your <em>hgrc</em> without
confirmation. So it is safe to run to see what's available. You should
consider running it periodically, say once a week or so. I wouldn't
be surprised if we add a notification to mach to remind you to do this.</p>
