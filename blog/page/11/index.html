  <p>Today was one crazy day.</p>
<p>The build peers all sat down with Release Engineering and Axel Hecht
to talk l10n packaging. <a href="http://glandium.org/">Mike Hommey</a> has a
Q1 goal to fix l10n packaging. There is buy-in from Release
Engineering on enabling him in his quest to slay dragons. This
will make builds faster and will pay off a massive mountain of
technical debt that plagues multiple groups at Mozilla.</p>
<p>The Firefox build system contributors sat down with a bunch of
Rust people and we talked about what it would take to integrate
Rust into the Firefox build system and the path towards shipping
a Rust component in Firefox. It sounds like that is going to
happen in 2015 (although we're not yet sure what component will
be written in Rust). I consider it an achievement that the gathering
of both groups didn't result in infinite rabbit holing about
system architectures, toolchains, and the build people telling
<em>horror stories</em> to wide-eyed Rust people about the crazy things
we have to do to build and ship Firefox. Believe me, the
temptation was there.</p>
<p>People interested in the build system all sat down and reflected on
the state of the build system and where we want to go. We agreed
to create a build mode optimized for non-Gecko developers
that downloads pre-built binaries - avoiding ~10 minutes of
C/C++ compile time for builds. Mark my words, this will be one
of those changes that once deployed will cause people to say
"I can't believe we went so long without this."</p>
<p>I joined Mark Côté and others to talk about priorities for
MozReview. We'll be making major improvements to the UX and
integrating static analysis into reviews. Push a patch for
review and have machines do some of the work that humans are
currently doing! We're tentatively planning a get-together in
Toronto in January to sprint towards awesomeness.</p>
<p>I ended the day by giving a long and rambling presentation about
version control, with emphasis on Mercurial. I can't help but
feel that I talked way too much. There's just so much knowledge
to cover. A few people told me afterwards they learned a lot. I'd
appreciate feedback if you attended. Anyway, I got a few nods
from people as I was saying some somewhat contentious things.
It's always good to have validation that I'm not on an island
when I say crazy things.</p>
<p>I hope to spend Friday chasing down loose ends from the week.
This includes talking to some security gurus about another crazy
idea of mine to integrate PGP into the code review and code
landing workflow for Firefox. I'll share more details once
I get a professional opinion on the security front.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed the Firefox trees
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">were closed</a>
for the better part of yesterday.</p>
<p>Long story short, a file containing URLs for Firefox installers was
updated to reference https://ftp.mozilla.org/ from
http://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/. The original, latter
host is a CDN. The former is not. When thousands of clients started
hitting ftp.mozilla.org, it overwhelmed the servers and network,
causing timeouts and other badness.</p>
<p>The change in question was accidental. It went through code review.
From a code change standpoint, procedures were followed.</p>
<p>It is tempting to point fingers at the people involved. However, I
want us to consider placing blame elsewhere: on the code review
tool.</p>
<p>The diff being reviewed was to change the Firefox version number
from 32.0 to 32.0.3. If you were asked to review this
patch, I'm guessing your eyes would have glanced over everything in the
URL except the version number part. I'm pretty sure mine would have.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what the reviewer saw in Bugzilla/Splinter (click
to see full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-splinter.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-splinter.png" width="600" />
</a></p>
<p>And here is what the reviewer would have seen had the review been
conducted in MozReview:</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png" width="600">
</a></p>
<p>Which tool makes the change of hostname more obvious? Bugzilla/Splinter
or MozReview?</p>
<p><strong>MozReview's support for intraline diffs more clearly draws attention to
the hostname change. I posit that had this patch been reviewed with
MozReview, the chances are greater we wouldn't have had a network
outage yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>And it isn't just intraline diffs that make Splinter/Bugzilla a
sub-optimal code review tool. I recently blogged about the
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">numerous ways that using Bugzilla for code revie results in harder
reviews and buggier
code</a>.
Every day we continue using Bugzilla/Splinter instead of investing in
better code review tools is a day severe bugs like this can and will
slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>If there is any silver lining to this outage, I hope it is that we need
to double down on our investment in developer tools, particularly code
review.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial and Git both experience scaling pains as the number of heads
in a repository approaches infinity. Operations like push and pull
slow to a crawl and everyone gets frustrated.</p>
<p>This is the problem Mozilla's Try repository has been dealing with
for years. We know the solution doesn't scale. But we've been content
kicking the can by resetting the repository (blowing away data)
to make the symptoms temporarily go away.</p>
<p>One of my official goals is to ship a scalable Try solution by the end
of 2014.</p>
<p>Today, I believe I finally have enough code cobbled together to
produce a working concept. <strong>And I could use your help testing it.</strong></p>
<p>I would like people to push their Try, code review, and other
miscellaneous heads to a special repository. To do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg push -r . -f ssh://hg@hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-headless
</code></pre>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the changeset belonging to the working copy</li>
<li>Allow the creation of new heads</li>
<li>Send it to the <em>gecko-headless</em> repo on hg.gregoryszorc.com using
  SSH</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what happening.</p>
<p>I have deployed a special repository to my personal server that I
believe will behave very similarly to the final solution.</p>
<p>When you push to this repository, instead of your changesets being
applied directly to the repository, it siphons them off to a Mercurial
bundle. It then saves this bundle somewhere along with some metadata
describing what is inside.</p>
<p>When you run <em>hg pull -r <node></em> on that repository and ask for a
changeset that exists in the bundle, the server does some magic
and returns data from the bundle file.</p>
<p>Things this repository doesn't do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This repository will not actually send changesets to Try for you.</strong></li>
<li>You cannot <code>hg pull</code> or <code>hg clone</code> the repository and get all of the
  commits from bundles. This isn't a goal. It will likely never be
  supported.</li>
<li>We do not yet record a pushlog entry for pushes to the repository.</li>
<li>The hgweb HTML interface does not <strong>yet</strong> handle commits that only
  exist in bundles. People want this to work. It will eventually work.</li>
<li>Pulling from the repository over HTTP with a vanilla Mercurial install
  may not preserve phase data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this experiment is to expose the repository to some
actual traffic patterns so I can see what's going on and get a feel
for real-world performance, variability, bugs, etc. I plan to do all
of this in the testing environment. But I'd like some real-world
use on the actual Firefox repository to give me peace of mind.</p>
<p>Please report any issues directly to me. Leave a comment here. Ping
me on IRC. Send me an email. etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-11-21: People discovered a bug with pushed changesets
accidentally being advanced to the public phase, despite the repository
being non-publishing. I have fixed the issue. But you must now push to
the repository over SSH, not HTTP.</strong></p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>We had a hiccup on hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It resulted in prolonged
tree closures for Firefox.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094922">Bug 1094922</a>
tracks the issue.</p>
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>We noticed that many HTTP requests to hg.mozilla.org were getting 503
responses. On initial glance, the servers were healthy. CPU was below
100% utilization, I/O wait was reasonable. And there was little to no
swapping. Furthermore, the logs showed a healthy stream of requests
being successfully processed at levels that are typical. In other words,
it looked like business as usual on the servers.</p>
<p>Upon deeper investigation, we noticed that the WSGI process pool on the
servers was fully saturated. There were were 24 slots/processes per server
allocated to process Mercurial requests and all 24 of them were actively
processing requests. This created a backlog of requests that had been
accepted by the HTTP server but were waiting an internal dispatch/proxy
to WSGI. To the client, this would appear as a request with a long lag
before response generation.</p>
<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>This being an emergency (trees were already closed and developers were
effectively unable to use hg.mozilla.org), we decided to increase the
size of the WSGI worker pool. After all, we had CPU, I/O, and memory
capacity to spare and we could identify the root cause later. We first
bumped worker pool capacity from 24 to 36 and immediately saw a significant
reduction in the number of pending requests awaiting a WSGI worker. We
still had spare CPU, I/O, and memory capacity and were still seeing
requests waiting on a WSGI worker, so we bumped the capacity to 48
processes. At that time, we stopped seeing worker pool exhaustion and
all incoming requests were being handed off to a WSGI worker as soon as
they came in.</p>
<p>At this time, things were looking pretty healthy from the server end.</p>
<h2>Impact on Memory and Swapping</h2>
<p>Increasing the number of WSGI processes had the side-effect of
increasing the total amount of system memory used by Mercurial
processes in two ways. First, more processes means more memory. That
part is obvious. Second, more processes means fewer requests for each
process per unit of time and thus it takes longer for each process to
reach its max number of requests being being reaped. (It is a common
practice in servers to have a single process hand multiple requests.
This prevents overhead associated with spawning a new process and
loading possibly expensive context in it.)</p>
<p>We had our Mercurial WSGI processes configured to serve 100 requests
before being reaped. With the doubling of WSGI processes from 24 to 48,
those processes were lingering for 2x as long as before. Since the
Mercurial processes grow over time (they are aggressive about caching
repository data), this was slowly exhausting our memory pool.</p>
<p>It took a few hours, but a few servers started flirting with high swap
usage. (We don't expect the servers to swap.) This is how we identified
that memory use wasn't sane.</p>
<p>We lowered the maximum requests per process from 100 to 50 to match
the ratio increase in the WSGI worker pool.</p>
<h2>Mercurial Memory "Leak"</h2>
<p>When we started looking at the memory usage of WSGI processes in more
detail, we noticed something strange: RSS of Mercurial processes was
growing steadily when processes were streaming bundle data. This seemed
very odd to me. Being a Mercurial developer, I was pretty sure the
behavior was wrong.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4443">filed a bug</a> against
Mercurial.</p>
<p>I was able to reproduce the issue locally and started running a
bisection to find the regressing changeset. To my surprise, this issue
has been around since Mercurial 2.7!</p>
<p>I looked at the code in question, identified why so much memory was
being allocated, and submitted patches to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063518.html">stop an unbounded memory growth during clone/pull</a>
and to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063520.html">further reduce memory use during those operations</a>.
Both of those patches have been queued to go in the next stable release
of Mercurial, 3.2.1.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.2 is still not as memory efficient during clones as Mercurial
2.5.4. If I have time, I'd like to formulate more patches. But the
important fix - not growing memory unbounded during clone/pull - is
in place.</p>
<p>Armed with the knowledge that Mercurial is leaky (although not a leak
in the traditional sense since the memory was eventually
getting garbage collected), we further reduced the max requests per
process from 50 to 20. This will cause processes to get reaped sooner
and will be more aggressive about keeping RSS growth in check.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>We suspect the root cause of the event is a network event.</p>
<p>Before this outage, we rarely had more than 10 requests being served
from the WSGI worker pool. In other words, we were often well below 50%
capacity. But something changed yesterday. More slots were being
occupied and high-bandwidth operations were taking longer to complete.
Kendall Libby noted that outbound traffic dropped by ~800 Mbps
during the event. For reasons that still haven't been identified, the
network became slower, clones weren't being processed as quickly, and
clients were occupying WSGI processes for longer amounts of time. This
eventually exhausted the available process pool, leading to HTTP 503's,
intermittent service availability, and a tree closure.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we noticed that in-flight HTTP requests are abnormally
high again this morning. However, because the servers are now configured
to handle the extra capacity, we seem to be powering through it without
any issues.</p>
<h2>In Hindsight</h2>
<p>You can make the argument that the servers weren't configured to serve
as much traffic as possible. After all, we were able to double the
WSGI process pool without hitting CPU, I/O, and memory limits.</p>
<p>The servers were conservatively configured. However, the worker pool
was initially configured at 2x CPU core count. And as a general rule of
thumb, you don't want your worker pool to be much greater than CPU
count because that introduces context switching and can give each
individual process a smaller slice of the CPU to process requests,
leading to higher latency. Since clone operations often manage to
peg a single CPU core, there is some justification for keeping the
ratio of WSGI workers to CPU count low. Furthermore, we rarely came
close to exhausting the WSGI worker pool before. There was little
to no justification for increasing capacity to a threshold not normally
seen.</p>
<p>But at the same time, even with 4x workers to CPU cores, our CPU
usage rarely flirts with 100% across all cores, even with the
majority of workers occupied. Until we actually hit CPU (or I/O)
limits, running a high multiplier seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Long term, we expect CPU usage during clone operations to drop
dramatically. Mike Hommey has contributed a patch to Mercurial that
allows servers to hand out a URL of a bundle file to fetch during
clone. So, a server can say <em>I have your data: fetch this static file
from S3 and then apply this small subset of the data that I'll give
you.</em> When properly deployed and used at Mozilla, this will effectively
drop server-side CPU usage for clones to nothing.</p>
<h2>Where to do Better</h2>
<p>There was a long delay between the Nagios alerts firing and someone
with domain-specific knowledge looking at the problem.</p>
<p>The trees could have reopened earlier. We were pretty confident about
the state of things at 1000. Trees opened in metered mode at 1246 and
completely at 1909. Although, the swapping issue wasn't mitigated until
1615, so you can argue that being conservative on the tree reopening
was justified. There is a chance that full reopening could have
triggered excessive swap and another round of chaos for everyone
involved.</p>
<p>We need an alert on WSGI pool exhaustion. It took longer than it should
have to identify this problem. However, now that we've encountered it,
it should be obvious if/when it happens again.</p>
<p>Firefox release automation is the largest single consumer of
hg.mozilla.org. Since they are operating thousands of machines, any
reduction in interaction or increase in efficiency will result in
drastic load reductions on the server. Chris AtLee and Jordan Lund
have been working on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1050109">bug 1050109</a> to
reduce clones of the mozharness and build/tools repositories, which
should go a long way to dropping load on the server.</p>
