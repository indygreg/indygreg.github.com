  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few weeks ago, some coworkers were complaining about the relative
performance of Mercurial cloning on Windows. I investigated on my
brand new i7-6700K Windows 10 desktop machine and sure enough they were
correct: cloning times on Windows were several minutes slower than
Linux on the same hardware. What gives?</p>
<p>I performed a few clones with Python under a profiler. It pointed to a
potential slowdown in file I/O. I wanted more details so I fired up
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896645.aspx">Sysinternals Process Monitor</a>
(strace for Windows) and captured data for a clone.</p>
<p>As I was looking at the raw system calls related to I/O, something
immediately popped out: <em>CloseFile()</em> operations were frequently
taking 1-5 <em>milliseconds</em> whereas other operations like opening, reading,
and writing files only took 1-5 <em>microseconds</em>. <strong>That's a 1000x
difference!</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a custom Python script to analyze an export of Process Monitor's
data. Sure enough, it said we were spending hundreds of seconds in
<em>CloseFile()</em> operations (it was being called a few hundred thousand
times). I posted the findings to some mailing lists.
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/yupx2ToQ5T4/WAMC_Q-DCAAJ">Follow-ups</a>
in Mozilla's dev-platform list pointed me to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/23/10215586.aspx">an old MSDN blog post</a>
where it documents behavior similar to what I was seeing.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>closing file handles that have been appended to is
slow on Windows.</strong> This is apparently due to an implementation detail of
NTFS. Writing to a file in place is fine and only takes microseconds for
the open, write, and close. But if you append a file, closing the
associated file handle is going to take a few milliseconds. Even if you
are using Overlapped I/O (async I/O on Windows), the <em>CloseHandle()</em>
call to close the file handle blocks the calling thread! Seriously.</p>
<p>This behavior is in stark contrast to Linux and OS X, where system I/O
functions take microseconds (assuming your I/O subsystem can keep up).</p>
<p>There are two ways to work around this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the amount of file closing operations on appended files.</li>
<li>Use multiple threads for I/O on Windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, I dug into the guts of Mercurial and
proceeded to write a
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/836291420d53">number</a>
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/39d643252b9f">of</a>
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/56a640b0f656">patches</a>
that drastically reduced the amount of file I/O system calls during
clone and pull operations. While I intend to write a blog post with the
full details, <strong>cloning the Firefox repository with Mercurial 3.6 on
Windows is now several minutes faster.</strong> Pretty much all of this is due
to reducing the number of file close operations by aggressively reusing
file handles.</p>
<p>I also
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-September/073788.html">experimented</a>
with moving file close operations to a separate thread on Windows. While
this change didn't make it into Mercurial 3.6, the results were very
promising. Even on Python (which doesn't have real asynchronous threads
due to the GIL), moving file closing to a background thread freed up the
main thread to do the CPU heavy work of processing data. This made clones
several minutes faster. (Python does release the GIL when performing an
I/O system call.) Furthermore, <strong>simply creating a dedicated thread for
closing file handles made Mercurial faster than 7-zip at writing tens of
thousands of files from an uncompressed tar archive</strong>. (I'm not going to
post the time for <em>tar</em> on Windows because it is embarassing.) That's a
Python process on Windows faster than a native executable that is lauded
for its speed (7-zip). Just by offloading file closing to a single
separate thread. Crazy.</p>
<p>I can optimize file closing in Mercurial all I want. However,
Mercurial's storage model relies on several files. For the Firefox
repository, we have to write ~225,000 files during clone. Assuming
1ms per file close (which is generous), that's 225s (or 3:45) wall
time performing file closes. That's not going to scale. I've already
started experimenting with alternative storage modes that initially use
1-6 files. This should enable Mercurial clones to run at over 100 MB/s
(yes, Python and Windows can do I/O that quickly if you are smart about
things).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that creating/appending to thousands of files
is slow on Windows and should be addressed at the architecture level
by not requiring thousands of files and at the implementation level
by minimizing the number of file close operations after write.
If you absolutely must create/append to thousands of files, use multiple
threads for at least closing file handles.</p>
<p>My secondary takeaway is that Sysinternals Process Monitor is amazing.
I used it against Firefox and immediately found
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1211090">performance concerns</a>.
It can be extremely eye opening to see how your higher-level code
is translated into function calls into your operating system and where
the performance hot spots are or aren't at the OS level.</p>

  <p>Starting today, a Mozilla LDAP account with Mercurial SSH access is no
longer required to <em>hg push</em> into
<a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview</a> to initiate code review
with Mozilla projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install.html">instructions for configuring your client to use MozReview</a>
have been updated to reflect how you can now push to MozReview over HTTP
using a Bugzilla API Key for authentication.</p>
<p>This change effectively enables first-time contributors to use MozReview
for code review. Before, you had to obtain an LDAP account and configure
your SSH client, both of which could be time consuming processes and
therefore discourage people from contributing. (Or you could just use
Bugzilla/Splinter and not get the benefits of MozReview, which many
did.)</p>
<p><strong>I encourage others to update contribution docs to start nudging people
towards MozReview over Bugzilla/patch-based workflows</strong> (such as
bzexport).</p>

  <p>For the past few months, Mozilla has been
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">serving Mercurial clones from Amazon S3</a>.
We upload snapshots (called <em>bundles</em>) of large and/or high-traffic
repositories to S3. We have a custom Mercurial extension on the
client and server that knows how to exchange the URLs for these
snapshots and to transparently use them to bootstrap a clone. The
end result is drastically reduced Mercurial server load and faster
clone times. The benefits are seriously ridiculous when you operate
version control at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a CDN.
You can easily configure it up to be backed by an S3 bucket. So
we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/</a> is
Mozilla's CDN for hosting Mercurial data. Currently it's just bundles to
be used for cloning.</p>
<p>As of today, if you
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">install the bundleclone Mercurial extension</a>
and <em>hg clone</em> a repository on
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> such as
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>), the CDN
URLs will be preferred by default. (Previously we preferred S3 URLs
that hit servers in Oregon, USA.)</p>
<p><strong>This should result in clone time reductions for Mozillians not
close to Oregon, USA</strong>, as the CloudFront CDN has servers all across
the globe and your Mercurial clone should be bootstrapped from the
closest and hopefully therefore fastest server to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need the the aforementioned <em>bundleclone</em>
extension installed for this to work. But, this should only be
temporary: I've
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StaticBundlePlan">proposed</a>
integrating this feature into the core of Mercurial so if a client
talks to a server advertising pre-generated bundles the clone
offload <em>just works</em>. I already have tentative buy-in from one
Mercurial maintainer. So hopefully I can land this feature in
Mercurial 3.6, which will be released November 1. After that,
I imagine some high-traffic Mercurial servers (such as Bitbucket)
will be very keen to deploy this so CPU load on their servers
is drastically reduced.</p>

  <p>I added a feature to Mercurial 3.4 that exposes JSON from Mercurial's
various <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/help/hgweb">web APIs</a>.
Unfortunately, due to the presence of legacy code on hg.mozilla.org
providing similar functionality, we weren't able to deploy this
feature to hg.mozilla.org when we deployed Mercurial 3.4 several weeks
ago.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that as of today, JSON is now exposed from
hg.mozilla.org!</p>
<p>To access JSON output, simply add <strong>json-</strong> to the <em>command</em> name
in URLs. e.g. instead of
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/de7aa6b08234">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/de7aa6b08234</a>
use <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234</a>.
The full list of web commands, URL patterns, and their parameters are
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/help/hgweb">documented</a> in
the <em>hgweb</em> help topic.</p>
<p>Not all web commands support JSON output yet. Not all web commands
expose all data available to them. If there is data you need but isn't
exposed, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>
and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Steven MacLeod for
<a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/15617/">reviewing</a> the rather large
series it took to make this happen.</p>

  <p>Sometime last week we enabled a new API on hg.mozilla.org:
<em>json-mozbuildinfo</em>. This endpoint will return JSON describing
moz.build-derived metadata about the files that changed in a commit.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-mozbuildinfo/1164ec236273">Example</a>.
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/mozbuildinfo.html">Docs</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to eventually leverage this API to do cool things like
have MozReview automatically file bugs in the appropriate component and
assign appropriate reviewers given the set of changed files in a commit.</p>
<p>The API is currently only available on mozilla-central. And, we have
very conservative resource limits in place. So large commits may cause
it to error out. As such, the API is considered experimental. Also,
performance is not as optimal as it could be. You have to start
somewhere.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Guillaume Destuynder (kang) for his help with the
security side of things. When I started on this project, I didn't think
I'd be writing
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/02e353037996/testing/docker/builder-hgweb-chroot/mozbuild-eval.c">C code for spawning secure processes</a>,
but here we are. In the not so distant future, I'll likely be adding
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a>
into the mix, which will make the execution environment as
or more secure than the Firefox content process sandbox, depending
on how it is implemented. The rabbit holes we find ourselves in to
implement proper security...</p>
