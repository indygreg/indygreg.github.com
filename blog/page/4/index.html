  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few weeks ago I
<a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications">introduced PyOxidizer</a>,
a project that aims to make it easier to produce completely self-contained
executables embedding a Python interpreter (using Rust). A few days later I
<a href="/blog/2018/12/28/faster-in-memory-python-module-importing/">observed some PyOxidizer performance benefits</a>.</p>
<p>After a few more hacking sessions, I'm very pleased to report that
PyOxidizer is now working on Windows!</p>
<p>I am able to produce a standalone Windows <code>.exe</code> containing a fully
featured CPython interpreter, all its library dependencies (OpenSSL, SQLite,
liblzma, etc), and a copy of the Python standard library (both source and
bytecode data). The binary weighs in at around 25 MB. (It could be smaller
if we didn't embed <code>.py</code> source files or stripped some dependencies.)
The only DLL dependencies of the exe are <code>vcruntime140.dll</code> and various
system DLLs that are always present on Windows.</p>
<p>Like I did for Linux and macOS, I produced a Python script that performs
~500 <code>import</code> statements for the near entirety of the Python standard library.
I then ran this script with both the official 64-bit Python distribution
and an executable produced with PyOxidizer:</p>
<pre><code># Official CPython 3.7.2 Windows distribution.
$ time python.exe &lt; import_stdlib.py
real    0m0.475s

# PyOxidizer with non-PGO CPython 3.7.2
$ time target/release/pyapp.exe &lt; import_stdlib.py
real    0m0.347s
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to the official CPython distribution, a PyOxidizer executable
can import almost the entirety of the Python standard library ~125ms
faster - or ~73% of original. In terms of the percentage of speedup,
the gains are similar to Linux and macOS. However, there is substantial
new process overhead on Windows compared to POSIX architectures. On the
same machine, a <em>hello world</em> Python process will execute in ~10ms on Linux
and ~40ms on Windows. If we remove the startup overhead, importing
the Python standard library runs at ~70% of its original time, making
the relative speedup on par with that seen on macOS + APFS.</p>
<p>Windows support is a major milestone for PyOxidizer. And it was the
hardest platform to make work. CPython's build system on Windows uses
Visual Studio project files. And coercing the build system to produce
static libraries was a real pain. Lots of CPython's build tooling assumes
Python is built in a very specific manner and multiple changes I made
completely break those assumptions. On top of that, it's very easy to
encounter problems with symbol name mismatch due to the use of
<code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> and <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code>. I spent
several hours going down a rabbit hole learning how Rust generates symbols
on Windows for <code>extern {}</code> items. Unfortunately, we currently have
to use a Rust Nightly feature (the <code>static-nobundle</code> linkage kind)
to get things to work. But I <em>think</em> there are options to remove that
requirement.</p>
<p>Up to this point, my work on PyOxidizer has focused on prototyping the
concept. With Windows out of the way and PyOxidizer working on Linux,
macOS, and Windows, I have achieved confidence that my vision of a
single executable embedding a full-featured Python interpreter is
technically viable on major desktop platforms! (BSD people, I care
about you too. The solution for Linux should be portable to BSD.)
This means I can start focusing on features, usability, and optimization.
In other words, I can start building a tool that others will want to use.</p>

  <p>I <a href="/blog/2018/12/18/distributing-standalone-python-applications/">recently blogged about</a>
distributing standalone Python applications. In that post, I announced
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a> - a tool which
leverages Rust to produce standalone executables embedding Python. One of the
features of PyOxidizer is the ability to import Python modules embedded
within the binary using zero-copy.</p>
<p>I also recently blogged about
<a href="/blog/2018/10/29/global-kernel-locks-in-apfs/">global kernel locks in APFS</a>,
which make filesystem operations slower on macOS. This was the latest wrinkle in
a long battle against Python's slow startup times, which I've posted about
on the official python-dev mailing list

<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">years</a>.</p>
<p>Since I announced PyOxidizer a few days ago, I've had some productive holiday
hacking sessions!</p>
<p>One of the reached milestones is PyOxidizer now supports macOS.</p>
<p>With that milestone reached, I thought it would be interesting to compare
the performance of a PyOxidizer executable versus a standard CPython build.</p>
<p>I produced a <a href="https://gist.github.com/indygreg/be1c229fa41ced5c76d912f7073f9de6">Python script</a>
that imports almost the entirety of the Python standard library - at least the
modules implemented in Python. That's 508 <code>import</code> statements. I then
executed this script using a typical <code>python3.7</code> binary (with the standard
library on the filesystem) and PyOxidizer-produced standalone executables
with a module importer that loads Python modules from memory using zero copy.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>First, the PyOxidizer times are all relatively similar regardless of whether
PGO or LTO is used to build CPython. That's not too surprising, as I'm
exercising a very limited subset of CPython (and I suspect the benefits
of PGO/LTO aren't as pronounced due to the nature of the CPython API).</p>
<p>But the bigger result is the obvious speedup with PyOxidizer and its
in-memory importing: <strong>PyOxidizer can import almost the entirety of the
Python standard library ~100ms faster - or ~70% of original - than a
typical standalone CPython install</strong> with a hot disk cache! This comes
out to ~0.19ms per <code>import</code> statement. If we run <code>purge</code> to clear out
the disk cache, the performance delta increases to 252ms, or ~64% of
original. All these numbers are on a 2018 6-core 2.9 GHz i9 MacBook Pro,
which has a pretty decent SSD.</p>
<p>And on Linux on an i7-6700K running in a Hyper-V VM:</p>
<pre><code># pyenv installed CPython 3.7.2

# Cold disk cache.
$ time ~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.2/bin/python &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.405s
user   0m0.165s

# Hot disk cache.
$ time ~/.pyenv/versions/3.7.2/bin/python &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.193s
user   0m0.161s
sys    0m0.032s

# PyOxidizer with PGO CPython 3.7.2

# Cold disk cache.
$ time target/release/pyapp &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.227s
user   0m0.145s
sys    0m0.016s

# Hot disk cache.
$ time target/release/pyapp &lt; import_stdlib.py
real   0m0.152s
user   0m0.136s
sys    0m0.016s
</code></pre>
<p>On a hot disk cache, the run-time improvement of PyOxidizer is ~41ms, or
~78% of original. This comes out to ~0.08ms per <code>import</code> statement. When
flushing caches by writing <code>3</code> to <code>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>, the delta
increases to ~178ms, or ~56% of original.</p>
<p>Using <code>dtruss -c</code> to execute the binaries, the breakdown in system calls
occurring &gt;10 times is clear:</p>

<p>PyOxidizer avoids hundreds of <code>open()</code>, <code>close()</code>, <code>read()</code>,
<code>fstat64()</code>, and <code>stat64()</code> calls. And by avoiding these calls,
PyOxidizer not only avoids the userland-kernel overhead intrinsic to them,
but also any additional overhead that APFS is imposing via its global
lock(s).</p>
<p>(Why the PyOxidizer binary is making hundreds of calls to <code>getentropy()</code>
I'm not sure. It's definitely coming from Python as a side-effect of a
module import and it is something I'd like to fix, if possible.)</p>
<p>With this experiment, we finally have the ability to better isolate the
impact of filesystem overhead on Python module importing and preliminary
results indicate that the overhead is not insignificant - at least on the
tested systems (I'll get data for Windows when PyOxidizer supports it).
While the test is somewhat contrived (I don't think many applications import
the entirety of the Python standard library), some Python applications do
import hundreds of modules. And as I've
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-May/153296.html">written before</a>,
milliseconds matter. This is especially true if you are invoking Python
processes hundreds or thousands of times in a build system, when running
a test suite, for scripting, etc. Cumulatively you can be importing tens
of thousands of modules. So I think shaving even fractions of a
millisecond from module importing is important.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in addition to the system call overhead, CPython's
path-based importer runs
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/804a5d94b6b7f8cb8546112aee2bc3af362f28f5/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py">substantially more</a>
Python code
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/c50e63338abd08ebac86746a33d750756d622edc/pyrepackager/src/memoryimporter.py">than PyOxidizer</a>
and this likely contributes several milliseconds of overhead as well. Because
PyOxidizer applications are static, the importer can remain simple (finding a
module in PyOxidizer is essentially a Rust <code>HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> lookup).
While it might be useful to isolate the filesystem overhead from Python code
overhead, the thing that end-users care about is overall execution time: they
don't care where that overhead is coming from. So I think it is fair to compare
PyOxidizer - with its intrinsically simpler import model - with what Python
typically does (scan <code>sys.path</code> entries and looking for modules on the
filesystem).</p>
<p>Another difference is that PyOxidizer is almost completely statically linked.
By contrast, a typical CPython install has compiled extension modules as
standalone shared libraries and these shared libraries often link against
other shared libraries (such as libssl). From <code>dtruss</code> timing information,
I don't believe this difference contributes to significant overhead, however.</p>
<p>Finally, I haven't yet optimized PyOxidizer. I still have a few tricks up
my sleeve that can likely shave off more overhead from Python startup. But
so far the results are looking <em>very</em> promising. I dare say they are looking
promising enough that Python distributions themselves might want to look
into the area more thoroughly and consider distribution defaults that rely
less on the every-Python-module-is-a-separate-file model.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer</a>
updates in the near future!</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Packaging and application distribution is a hard problem on multiple
dimensions. For Python, large aspects of this problem space are more or
less solved if you are distributing open source Python libraries and your
target audience is developers (<em>use pip and PyPI</em>). But if you are distributing
Python <em>applications</em> - standalone executables that use Python - your
world can be much more complicated.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons why distributing Python applications is difficult
is because of the complex and often sensitive relationship between a Python
application and the environment it runs in.</p>
<p>For starters we have the Python interpreter itself. If your application doesn't
distribute the Python interpreter, you are at the whims of the Python
interpreter provided by the host machine. You may want to target Python 3.7
only. But because Python 3.5 or 3.6 is the most recent version installed by
many Linux distros, you are forced to support older Python versions and all
their quirks and lack of features.</p>
<p>Going down the rabbit hole, even the presence of a supposedly compatible
version of the Python interpreter isn't a guarantee for success! For example,
the Python interpreter could have a built-in extension that links against
an old version of a library. Just last week I was encountering weird SQlite
bugs in Firefox's automation because Python was using an old version of
SQLite with known bugs. Installing a modern SQLite fixed the problems. Or
the interpreter could have modifications or extra installed packages
interfering with the operation of your application. There are never-ending
corner cases. And I can tell you from my experience with having to support
the Firefox build system (which uses Python heavily) that you will encounter
these corner cases given a broad enough user base.</p>
<p>And even if the Python interpreter on the target machine is fully compatible,
getting your code to run on that interpreter could be difficult! Several
Python applications leverage compiled extensions linking against Python's
C API. Distributing the precompiled form of the extension can be challenging,
especially when your code needs to link against 3rd party libraries, which
may conflict with something on the target system. And, the precompiled
extensions need to be built in a very delicate manner to ensure they can
run on as many target machines as possible. But not distributing pre-built
binaries requires the end-user be able to compile Python extensions. Not
every user has such an environment and forcing this requirement on them is
not user friendly.</p>
<p><strong>From an application developer's point of view, distributing a copy of the
Python interpreter along with your application is the only reliable way of
guaranteeing a more uniform end-user experience.</strong> Yes, you will still
have variability because every machine is different. But you've eliminated
the the Python interpreter from the set of unknowns and that is a huge win.
(Unfortunately, distributing a Python interpreter comes with a host of other
problems such as size bloat, security/patching concerns, poking the OS
packaging bears, etc. But those problems are for another post.)</p>
<h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
<p>There are tons of existing tools for <em>solving</em> the Python application
distribution problem.</p>
<p>The approach that tools like <a href="https://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Shiv</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex">PEX</a> take is to leverage Python's
built-in support for <em>running</em> zip files. Essentially, if there is a zip
file containing a <code>__main__.py</code> file and you execute <code>python file.zip</code>
(or have a zip file with a <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> shebang), Python
can load modules in that zip file and execute an application within. Pretty
cool!</p>
<p>This approach works great if your execution environment supports shebangs
(Windows doesn't) and the Python interpreter is suitable. But if you need
to support Windows or don't have control over the execution environment
and can't guarantee the Python interpreter is <em>good</em>, this approach isn't
suitable.</p>
<p>As stated above, we want to distribute the Python interpreter with our
application to minimize variability. Let's talk about tools that do that.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar/">XAR</a> is a pretty cool offering
from Facebook. XAR files are executables that contain
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">SquashFS</a> filesystems. Upon running
the executable, SquashFS filesystems are created. For Python applications,
the XAR contains a copy of the Python interpreter and all your Python modules.
At run-time, these files are <em>extracted</em> to SquashFS filesystems and the
Python interpreter is executed. If you squint hard enough, it is kind of
like a pre-packaged, executable virtualenv which also contains the Python
interpreter.</p>
<p>XARs are pretty cool (and aren't limited to Python). However, because XARs
rely on SquashFS, they have a run-time requirement on the target machine.
This is great if you only need to support Linux and macOS and your target
machines support FUSE and SquashFS. But if you need to support Windows or
a general user population without SquashFS support, XARs won't help you.</p>
<p>Zip files and XARs are great for enterprises that have tightly controlled
environments. But for a general end-user population, we need something
more robust against variance among target machines.</p>
<p>There are a handful of tools for packaging Python applications along with
the Python interpreter in more resilient manners.</p>
<p><a href="http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html">Nuitka</a> <em>converts</em> Python source
to C code then compiles and links that C code against libpython. You can
perform a static link and compile everything down to a single executable.
If you do the compiling properly, that executable should <em>just work</em> on
pretty much every target machine. That's pretty cool and is exactly the
kind of solution application distributors are looking for: you can't get
much simpler than a self-contained executable! While I'd love to vouch
for Nuitka and recommend using it, I haven't used it so can't. And I'll
be honest, the prospect of compiling Python source to C code kind of
terrifies me. That effectively makes Nuitka a new Python implementation
and I'm not sure I can (yet) place the level of trust in Nuitka that I
have for e.g. CPython and PyPy.</p>
<p>And that leads us to our final category of tools:
<a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/">freezing your code</a>. There
are a handful of tools like <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>
which automate the process of building your Python application (often via
standard <code>setup.py</code> mechanisms), assembling all the requisite bits of
the Python interpreter, and producing an artifact that can be distributed
to end users. There are even tools that produce Windows installers, RPMs,
DEBs, etc that you can sign and distribute.</p>
<p>These <em>freezing</em> tools are arguably the state of the art for Python
application distribution to general user populations. On first glance
it seems like all the needed tools are available here. But there are
cracks below the surface.</p>
<h2>Issues with Freezing</h2>
<p>A common problem with freezing is it often relies on the Python interpreter
used to build the frozen application. For example, when building a frozen
application on Linux, it will bundle the system's Python interpreter with
the frozen application. And that interpreter may link against libraries
or libc symbol versions not available on all target machines. So, the
build environment has to be <em>just right</em> in order for the binaries to
run on as many target systems as possible. This isn't an insurmountable
problem. But it adds overhead and complexity to application maintainers.</p>
<p>Another limitation is how these frozen applications handle importing
Python modules.</p>
<p>Multiple tools take the approach of embedding an archive (usually a zip file)
in the executable containing the Python <em>standard library</em> bits not part of
libpython. This includes C extensions (compiled to <code>.so</code> or <code>.pyd</code> files)
and Python source (<code>.py</code>) or bytecode (<code>.pyc</code>) files. There is typically
a step - either at application start time or at module import time - where a
file is extracted to the filesystem such that Python's filesystem-based
importer can load it from there.</p>
<p>For example, PyInstaller <a href="https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html#how-the-one-file-program-works">extracts the standard library to a temporary directory
at application start time</a>
(at least when running in single file mode). This can add significant overhead
to the startup time of applications - more than enough to blow through people's
ability to perceive something as <em>instantaneous</em>. This is acceptable for
long-running applications. But for applications (like CLI tools or support
tools for build systems), the overhead can be a non-starter. And, the mere
fact that you are doing filesystem write I/O establishes a requirement that
the application have write access to the filesystem and that write I/O can
perform reasonably well lest application performance suffer. These can be
difficult pills to swallow!</p>
<p>Another limitation is that these tools often assume the executable being
produced is only a Python application. Sometimes Python is <em>part of</em> a
larger application. It would be useful to produce a library that can
easily be embedded within a larger application.</p>
<h2>Improving the State of the Art</h2>
<p>Existing Python application distribution mechanisms don't tick all the
requirements boxes for me. We have tools that are suitable for internal
distribution in well-defined <em>enterprise</em> environments. And we have tools
that target general user populations, albeit with a burden on application
maintainers and often come with a performance hit and/or limited flexibility.</p>
<p>I want something that allows me to produce a standalone, single file executable
containing a Python interpreter, the Python standard library (or a subset of
it), and all the custom code and resources my application needs. That
executable should not require any additional library dependencies beyond what is
already available on most target machines (e.g. libc). That executable should
not require any special filesystem providers (e.g. FUSE/SquashFS) nor should
it require filesystem write access nor perform filesystem write I/O at run-time.
I should be able to embed a Python interpreter within a larger application,
without the overhead of starting the Python interpreter if it isn't needed.</p>
<p>No existing solution ticks all of these boxes.</p>
<p>So I set out to build one.</p>
<p>One problem is producing a Python interpreter that is portable and
fully-featured. You can't punt on this problem because if the core Python
interpreter isn't produced in just the right way, your application will
depend on libraries or symbol versions not available in all environments.</p>
<p>I've created the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
project for automating the process of building Python interpreters suitable
for use with standalone, distributable Python applications. The project
produces (and has available for download) binary artifacts including a
pre-compiled Python interpreter and object files used for compiling that
interpreter. The Python interpreter is compiled with PGO/LTO using a modern
Clang, helping to ensure that Python code runs as fast as it can. All of
Python's dependencies are compiled from source with the modern toolchain and
everything is aggressively statically linked to avoid external dependencies.
The toolchain and pre-built distribution are available for downstream
consumers to compile Python extensions with/against.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that use of a modern Clang toolchain is likely sufficiently
different from what you use today. When producing <em>manylinux</em> wheels, it is
recommended to use the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux">pypa/manylinux</a>
Docker images. These Docker images are based on CentOS 5 (for maximum libc
and other system library compatibility). While they do install a custom
toolchain, Python and any extensions compiled in that environment are compiled
with GCC 4.8.2 (as of this writing). That's a GCC from 2013. A lot has
changed in compilers since 2013 and building Python and extensions with a
compiler released in 2018 should result in various benefits (faster code,
better warnings, etc).</p>
<p>If producing custom CPython builds for standalone distribution interests
you, you should take a look at how I coerced CPython to statically link
all extensions. Spoiler: it involves producing a custom-tailored
<code>Modules/Setup.local</code> file that bypasses <code>setup.py</code>, along with some
<code>Makefile</code> hacks. Because the build environment is deterministic and isolated
in a container, we can get away with some ugly hacks.</p>
<p>A statically linked <code>libpython</code> from which you can produce a standalone
binary embedding Python is only the first layer in the onion. The next layer
is how to handle the Python standard library.</p>
<p><code>libpython</code> only contains the code needed to run the core bits of the Python
interpreter. If we attempt to run a statically linked <code>python</code> executable
without the standard library in the filesystem, things fail pretty fast:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm -rf lib
$ bin/python
Could not find platform independent libraries &lt;prefix&gt;
Could not find platform dependent libraries &lt;exec_prefix&gt;
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to &lt;prefix&gt;[:&lt;exec_prefix&gt;]
Fatal Python error: initfsencoding: Unable to get the locale encoding
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'

Current thread 0x00007fe9a3432740 (most recent call first):
Aborted (core dumped)
</code></pre>
<p>I'll spare you the details for the moment, but initializing the CPython
interpreter (via <code>Py_Initialize()</code> <em>requires</em> that parts of the Python
standard library be available). This means that in order to fulfill our dream
of a single file executable, we will need custom code that teaches the
embedded Python interpreter to load the standard library from within the
binary... somehow.</p>
<p>As far as I know, efficient embedded standard library handling without run-time
requirements does not exist in the current Python packaging/distribution
ecosystem. So, I had to devise something new.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/pyoxidizer">PyOxidizer</a>. PyOxidizer is
a collection of Rust crates that facilitate building an embeddable Python
library, which can easily be added to an executable. We need <em>native</em> code
to interface with the Python C APIs in order to influence Python interpreter
startup. It is 2018 and Rust is a better C/C++, so I chose Rust for this
<em>driver</em> functionality instead of C. Plus, Rust's integrated build system
makes it easier to automate the integration of the custom Python interpreter
files into binaries.</p>
<p>The role of PyOxidizer is to take the pre-built Python interpreter files from
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>,
combine those files with any other Python files needed to run an application,
and marry them to a Rust crate. This Rust crate can trivially be turned into
a self-contained executable containing a Python application. Or, it can be
combined with another Rust project. Or it can be emitted as a library and
integrated with a non-Rust application. There's a lot of flexibility by design.</p>
<p>The mechanism I used for embedding the Python standard library into a single
file executable without incurring explicit filesystem access at run-time is
(I believe) new, novel, and somewhat crazy. Let me explain how it works.</p>
<p>First, there are no <code>.so</code>/<code>.pyd</code> shared library compiled Python extensions
to worry about. This is because all compiled extensions are statically linked
into the Python interpreter. To the interpreter, they exist as
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.BuiltinImporter">built-in modules</a>.
Typically, a CPython build will have some modules like <code>_abc</code>, <code>_io</code>, and
<code>sys</code> provided by <em>built-in modules</em>. Modules like <code>_json</code> exist as standalone
shared libraries that are loaded on demand. <code>python-build-standalone</code>'s
modifications to CPython's build system converts all these would-be standalone
shared libraries into <em>built-in modules</em>. (Because we distribute the object
files that compose the eventual <code>libpython</code>, it is possible to filter out
unwanted modules to cut down on binary size if you don't want to ship a
fully-featured Python interpreter.) Because there are no standalone shared
libraries providing Python modules, we don't have the problem of needing to
load a shared library to load a module, which would undermine our goal of
<em>no filesystem access to import modules</em>. And that's a good thing, too,
because <code>dlopen()</code> requires a path: you can't load a shared library from
a memory address. (Fun fact: there are hacks like
<a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11767">dlopen_with_offset()</a>
that provide an API to load a library from memory, but they require a custom
libc. Google uses this approach for their internal single-file Python
application solution.)</p>
<p>From the <code>python-build-standalone</code> artifacts, PyOxidizer collects all files
belonging to the Python standard library (notably <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyc</code> files).
It also collects other source, bytecode, and resource files needed to run
a custom application.</p>
<p>The relevant files are assembled and serialized into data structures which
contain the names of the resources and their raw content. These data structures
are made available to Rust as <code>&amp;'static [u8]</code> variables (essentially a
<code>static void*</code> if you don't speak Rust).</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython">rust-cpython</a> crate,
PyOxidizer defines a custom Python extension module implemented purely in Rust.
When loaded, the module parses the data structures containing available
Python resource names and data into <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;str, &amp;[u8]&gt;</code> instances. In other
words, it builds a native mapping from resource name to a pointer to its raw
data. The Rust-implemented module exports to Python an API for accessing that
data. From the Python side, you do the equivalent of <code>MODULES.get_code('foo')</code>
to request the bytecode for a named Python module. When called, the Rust code
will perform the lookup and return a <code>memoryview</code> instance pointing to the
raw data. (The use of <code>&amp;[u8]</code> and <code>memoryview</code> means that embedded resource
data is loaded from its static, read-only memory location instead of copied
into a data structure managed by Python. This zero copy approach translates to
less overhead for importing modules. Although, the memory needs to be paged
in by the operating system. So on slow filesystems, reducing I/O and e.g.
compressing module data might be a worthwhile optimization. This can be a
future feature.) </p>
<p>Making data embedded within a binary available to a Python module is relatively
easy. I'm definitely not the first person to come up with this idea. What is
hard - and what I <em>might</em> be the first person to actually do - is how you make
the Python module importing mechanism load <em>all</em> standard library modules via
such a mechanism.</p>
<p>With a custom extension module built-in to the binary exposing module data,
it should <em>just</em> be a matter of registering a custom
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path">sys.meta_path</a>
importer that knows how to load modules from that custom location. This
problem turns out to be quite hard!</p>
<p>The initialization of a CPython interpreter is - as I've learned - a bit
complex. A CPython interpreter must be initialized via <code>Py_Initialize()</code>
before any Python code can run. That means in order to modify <code>sys.meta_path</code>,
<code>Py_Initialize()</code> must finish.</p>
<p>A lot of activity occurs under the hood during initialization. Applications
embedding Python have very little control over what happens during
<code>Py_Initialize()</code>. You can change some superficial things like what
filesystem paths to use to bootstrap <code>sys.path</code> and what encodings to use
for stdio descriptors. But you can't really influence the core actions that are
being performed. And there's no mechanism to directly influence
<code>sys.meta_path</code> before an <code>import</code> is performed. (Perhaps there should be?)</p>
<p>During <code>Py_Initialize()</code>, the interpreter needs to configure the encodings
for the filesystem and the stdio descriptors. Encodings are loaded from
Python modules provided by the standard library. So, during the course of
<code>Py_Initialize()</code>, the interpreter needs to import some modules originally
backed by <code>.py</code> files. This creates a dilemma: if <code>Py_Initialize()</code>
needs to <code>import</code> modules in the standard library, the standard library
is backed by memory and isn't available to known importing mechanisms, and
there's no opportunity to configure a custom <code>sys.meta_path</code> importer
before <code>Py_Initialize()</code> runs, how do you teach the interpreter about
your custom module importer and the location of the standard library modules
needed by <code>Py_Initialize()</code>?</p>
<p>This is an extremely gnarly problem and it took me some hours and many false
leads to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved the esoteric
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/import.html#c.PyImport_FrozenModules">frozen modules</a>
feature. (This work predated the use of a custom data structure and module
containing modules data.) The Python interpreter has a
<code>const struct _frozen* PyImport_FrozenModules</code> data structure defining an
array of <em>frozen</em> modules. A <em>frozen</em> module is defined by its module
name and precompiled bytecode data (roughly equivalent to <code>.pyc</code> file
content). Partway through <code>Py_Initialize()</code>, the Python interpreter is able
to import modules. And one of the built-in importers that is automatically
registered knows how to load modules if they are in <code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code>!</p>
<p>I attempted to audit Python interpreter startup and find all modules
that were imported during <code>Py_Initialize()</code>. I then defined a custom
<code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> containing these modules. In theory, the import
of these modules during <code>Py_Initialize()</code> would be handled by the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.FrozenImporter">FrozenImporter</a>
and everything would <em>just work</em>: if I were able to get <code>Py_Initialize()</code> to
complete, I'd be able to register a custom <code>sys.meta_path</code> importer
immediately afterwards and we'd be set.</p>
<p>Things did not go as planned.</p>
<p><code>FrozenImporter</code> doesn't fully conform to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0451/">PEP 451</a> requirements for
setting specific attributes on modules. Without these attributes, the
<code>from . import aliases</code> statement in <code>encodings/__init__.py</code> fails
because the importer is unable to resolve the relative module name. Derp.
One would think CPython's built-in importers would comply with PEP 451
and that all of Python's standard library could be imported as frozen modules.
But this is not the case! I was able to hack around this particular failure
by using an absolute import. But I hit another failure and did not want to
excavate that rabbit hole. Once I realized that <code>FrozenImporter</code> was lacking
mandated module attributes, I concluded that attempting to use <em>frozen modules</em>
as a general import-from-memory mechanism was not viable. Furthermore, the
C code backing <code>FrozenImporter</code> walks the <code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> array and
does a string compare on the module name to find matches. While I didn't
benchmark, I was concerned that un-indexed scanning at import time would
add considerable overhead when hundreds of modules were in play. (The C code
backing <code>BuiltinImporter</code> uses the same approach and I do worry CPython's
imports of built-in extension modules is causing measurable overhead.)</p>
<p>With <em>frozen modules</em> off the table, I needed to find another way to inject
a custom module importer that was usable during <code>Py_Initialize()</code>. Because
we control the source Python interpreter, modifications to the source code
or even link-time modifications or run-time hacks like trampolines weren't
off the table. But I <strong>really</strong> wanted things to work out of the box because
I don't want to be in the business of maintaining patches to Python
interpreters.</p>
<p>My foray into <em>frozen modules</em> enlightened me to the craziness that is
the bootstrapping of Python's importing mechanism.</p>
<p>I remember hearing that the Python module importing mechanism used to be
written in C and was rewritten in Python. And I knew that the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/importlib.html">importlib</a> package
defined interfaces allowing you to implement your own importers, which
could be registered on
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path">sys.meta_path</a>.
But I didn't know how all of this worked at the interpreter level.</p>
<p>The internal <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/08c2ba0717089662132af69bf5948d82277a8a69/Python/pylifecycle.c#L178">initimport()</a>
C function is responsible for initializing the module importing mechanism. It
does the equivalent of <code>import _frozen_importlib</code>, but using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/import.html#c.PyImport_ImportFrozenModuleObject">PyImport_ImportFrozenModule()</a>
API. It then manipulates some symbols and calls <code>_frozen_importlib.install()</code>
with references to the <code>sys</code> and <code>imp</code> built-in modules. Later (in
<code>initexternalimport()</code>), a <code>_frozen_importlib_external</code> module is imported
and has code within it executed.</p>
<p>I was initially very confused by this because - while there are references
to <code>_frozen_importlib</code> and <code>_frozen_importlib_external</code> all over the
CPython code base, I couldn't figure out where the code for those modules
actually lived! Some sleuthing of the build directory eventually revealed
that the files <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/08c2ba0717089662132af69bf5948d82277a8a69/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py">Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/08c2ba0717089662132af69bf5948d82277a8a69/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py">Lib/importlib/_bootstrap_external.py</a>
were <em>frozen</em> to the module names <code>_frozen_importlib</code> and
<code>_frozen_importlib_external</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>Essentially what is happening is the bulk of Python's import <em>machinery</em> is
implemented in Python (rather than C). But there's a chicken-and-egg
problem where you can't run just any Python code (including any <code>import</code>
statement) until the interpreter is partially or fully initialized.</p>
<p>When building CPython, the Python source code for <code>importlib._bootstrap</code>
and <code>importlib._bootstrap_external</code> are compiled to bytecode. This
bytecode is emitted to <code>.h</code> files, where it is exposed as a
<code>static char *</code>. This bytecode is eventually referenced by the
default <code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> array, allowing the modules to be
imported via the frozen importer's C API, which bypasses the higher-level
importing mechanism, allowing it to work before the full importing
mechanism is initialized.</p>
<p><code>initimport()</code> and <code>initexternalimport()</code> both call Python functions in
the frozen modules. And we can clearly look at the source of the
corresponding modules and see the Python code do things like
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/08c2ba0717089662132af69bf5948d82277a8a69/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py#L1158">register the default importers on <code>sys.meta_path</code></a>.</p>
<p>Whew, that was a long journey into the bowels of CPython's internals. How
does all this help with single file Python executables?</p>
<p>Well, the predicament that led us down this rabbit hole was there was no
way to register a custom module importer before <code>Py_Initialize()</code>
completes and before an <code>import</code> is attempted during said <code>Py_Initialize()</code>.</p>
<p>It took me a while, but I finally realized the frozen
<code>importlib._bootstrap_external</code> module provided the window I needed!
<code>importlib._bootstrap_external</code>/<code>_frozen_importlib_external</code> is <em>always</em>
executed during <code>Py_Initialize()</code>. So if you can modify this module's code,
you can run arbitrary code during <code>Py_Initialize()</code> and influence Python
interpreter configuration. And since <code>_frozen_importlib_external</code> is a frozen
module and the <code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> array is writable and can be modified
before <code>Py_Initialize()</code> is called, all one needs to do is replace the
<code>_frozen_importlib</code> / <code>_frozen_importlib_external</code> bytecode in
<code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> and you can run arbitrary code during Python
interpreter startup, before <code>Py_Initialize()</code> completes and before any
standard library imports are performed!</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to concatenate some custom Python code to
<code>importlib/_bootstrap_external.py</code>. This custom code defines a
<code>sys.meta_path</code> importer that knows how to use our Rust-backed built-in
extension module to find and load module data. It redefines the <code>_install()</code>
function so that this custom importer is registered on <code>sys.meta_path</code>
when the function is called during <code>Py_Initialize()</code>. The <em>new</em> Python
source is compiled to bytecode and the <code>PyImport_FrozenModules</code> array is
modified at run-time to point to the modified <code>_frozen_importlib_external</code>
implementation. When <code>Py_Initialize()</code> executes its first standard library
import, module data is provided by the custom <code>sys.meta_path</code> importer,
which grabs it from a Rust extension module, which reads it from a
read-only data structure in the executable binary, which is converted
to a Python <code>memoryview</code> instance and sent back to Python for processing.</p>
<p>There's a bit of <em>magic</em> happening behind the scenes to make all of this
work. PyOxidizer attempts to hide as much of the gory details as possible.
From the perspective of an application maintainer, you just need to define
a minimal config file and it handles most of the low-level details. And there's
even a higher-level Rust API for configuring the embedded Python interpreter,
should you need it.</p>
<p><code>python-build-standalone</code> and <code>PyOxidizer</code> are still in their infancy.
They are very much alpha quality. I consider them technology previews more
than usable software at this point. But I think enough is there to demonstrate
the viability of using Rust as the build system and run-time glue to build
and distribute standalone applications embedding Python.</p>
<p>Time will tell if my utopian vision of zero-copy, no explicit filesystem
I/O for Python module imports will pan out. Others who have ventured into
this space have warned me that lots of Python modules rely on <code>__file__</code>
to derive paths to other resources, which are later <code>stat()</code>d and
<code>open()</code>d. <code>__file__</code> for in-memory modules doesn't exactly make sense
and can't be operated on like normal paths/files. I'm not sure what the
inevitable struggles to support these modules will lead to. Maybe we'll have
to extract things to temporary directories like other standalone Python
applications. Maybe <code>PyOxidizer</code> will take off and people will start using
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.ResourceReader">ResourceReader</a>
API, which is apparently the proper way to do these things these days.
(Caveat: <code>PyOxidizer</code> doesn't yet implement this API but support is planned.)
Time will tell. I'm not opposed to gross hacks or writing more code as
needed.</p>
<p>Producing highly distributable and performant Python applications has been far
too difficult for far too long. My primary goal for PyOxidizer is to lower these
barriers. By leveraging Rust, I also hope to bring Python and Rust closer
together. I want to enable applications and libraries to effortlessly harness
the powers of both of these fantastic programming languages.</p>
<p>Again, <code>PyOxidizer</code> is still in its infancy. I anticipate a significant amount
of hacking over the holidays and hope to share updates in the weeks ahead. Until
then, please leave comments, watch the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">project on GitHub</a>,
file issues for bugs and feature requests, etc and we'll see where things lead.</p>

  <small>November 05, 2018 at 09:25 AM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Every so often a tool you use introduces a feature that is so useful
that you can't imagine how things were before that feature existed.
The recent 4.8 release of the
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial version control tool</a> introduces
such a feature: the <code>hg absorb</code> command.</p>
<p><code>hg absorb</code> is a mechanism to automatically and intelligently incorporate
uncommitted changes into prior commits. Think of it as <em><code>hg histedit</code> or
<code>git rebase -i</code> with auto squashing</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a set of changes to prior commits in your working
directory. <code>hg absorb</code> figures out which changes map to which commits
and <em>absorbs</em> each of those changes into the appropriate commit. Using
<code>hg absorb</code>, you can replace cumbersome and often merge conflict ridden
history editing workflows with a single command that often <em>just works</em>.
Read on for more details and examples.</p>
<p>Modern version control workflows often entail having multiple <em>unlanded</em>
commits in flight. What this looks like varies heavily by the version
control tool, standards and review workflows employed by the specific
project/repository, and personal preferences.</p>
<p>A workflow practiced by a lot of projects is to author your commits
into a sequence of standalone commits, with each commit representing
a discrete, logical unit of work. Each commit is then
reviewed/evaluated/tested on its own as part of a larger series.
(This workflow is practiced by Firefox, the Git and Mercurial projects,
and the Linux Kernel to name a few.)</p>
<p>A common task that arises when working with such a workflow is the need
to incorporate changes into an old commit. For example, let's say we have
a stack of the following commits:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg show stack
  @  1c114a ansible/hg-web: serve static files as immutable content
  o  d2cf48 ansible/hg-web: synchronize templates earlier
  o  c29f28 ansible/hg-web: convert hgrc to a template
  o  166549 ansible/hg-web: tell hgweb that static files are in /static/
  o  d46d6a ansible/hg-web: serve static template files from httpd
  o  37fdad testing: only print when in verbose mode
 /   (stack base)
o  e44c2e (@) testing: install Mercurial 4.8 final
</code></pre>
<p>Contained within this stack are 5 commits changing the way that static
files are served by hg.mozilla.org (but that's not important).</p>
<p>Let's say I submit this stack of commits for review. The reviewer spots
a problem with the second commit (<em>serve static template files from httpd</em>)
and wants me to make a change.</p>
<p>How do you go about making that change?</p>
<p>Again, this depends on the exact tool and workflow you are using.</p>
<p>A common workflow is to not rewrite the existing commits at all: you simply
create a new <em>fixup</em> commit on top of the stack, leaving the existing commits
as-is. e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg show stack
  o  deadad fix typo in httpd config
  o  1c114a ansible/hg-web: serve static files as immutable content
  o  d2cf48 ansible/hg-web: synchronize templates earlier
  o  c29f28 ansible/hg-web: convert hgrc to a template

<p>When the entire series of commits is incorporated into the repository,
the end state of the files is the same, so all is well. But this strategy
of using <em>fixup commits</em> (while popular - especially with Git-based tooling
like GitHub that puts a larger emphasis on the end state of changes rather
than the individual commits) isn't practiced by all projects.
<strong><code>hg absorb</code> will not help you if this is your workflow.</strong></p>
<p>A popular variation of this <em>fixup commit</em> workflow is to author a new commit
then <em>incorporate</em> this commit into a prior commit. This typically involves
the following actions:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to a file&gt;

$ hg commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg histedit
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to a file&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git rebase --interactive
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, you produce a new commit. Then you run a history editing command.
You then tell that history editing command what to do (e.g. to <em>squash</em> or
<em>fold</em> one commit into another), that command performs work and produces a set
of rewritten commits.</p>
<p>In simple cases, you may make a simple change to a single file. Things are
pretty straightforward. You need to know which two commits to <em>squash</em> together.
This is often trivial. Although it can be cumbersome if there are several
commits and it isn't clear which one should be receiving the new changes.</p>
<p>In more complex cases, you may make multiple modifications to multiple files.
You may even want to <em>squash</em> your <em>fixups</em> into separate commits. And for some
code reviews, this <em>complex</em> case can be quite common. It isn't uncommon for me
to be incorporating dozens of reviewer-suggested changes across several commits!</p>
<p>These complex use cases are where things can get really complicated for version
control tool interactions. Let's say we want to make multiple changes to a file
and then incorporate those changes into multiple commits. To keep it simple,
let's assume 2 modifications in a single file <em>squashing</em> into 2 commits:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg commit --interactive
&lt;select changes to commit&gt;
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ hg histedit
&lt;manually choose what actions to perform to what commits&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git add --interactive
&lt;select changes to stage&gt;

$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git add &lt;file&gt;
$ git commit
&lt;type commit message&gt;

$ git rebase --interactive
&lt;manually choose which actions to perform to what commits&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the number of actions required by users has already increased
substantially. Not captured by the number of lines is the effort that must go
into the interactive commands like <code>hg commit --interactive</code>,
<code>git add --interactive</code>, <code>hg histedit</code>, and <code>git rebase --interactive</code>. For
these commands, users must tell the VCS tool exactly what actions to take.
This takes time and requires some cognitive load. This ultimately distracts
the user from the task at hand, which is bad for concentration and productivity.
The user just wants to <em>amend</em> old commits: telling the VCS tool what actions
to take is an obstacle in their way. (A compelling argument can be made that
the work required with these workflows to produce a <em>clean</em> history is too much
effort and it is easier to make the trade-off favoring simpler workflows
versus cleaner history.)</p>
<p><strong>These kinds of <em>squash fixup</em> workflows are what <code>hg absorb</code> is designed to
make easier.</strong> When using <code>hg absorb</code>, the above workflow can be reduced to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg absorb
&lt;hit y to accept changes&gt;

OR

&lt;save changes to file&gt;

$ hg absorb --apply-changes

<p><code>hg absorb</code> automatically figured out that the 2 separate uncommitted changes
<em>mapped</em> to 2 different changesets (Mercurial's term for <em>commit</em>). It
print a summary of what lines would be changed in what changesets and
prompted me to accept its <em>plan</em> for how to proceed. The human effort involved
is a quick review of the proposed changes and answering a prompt.</p>
<p>At a technical level, <code>hg absorb</code> finds all uncommitted changes and
attempts to map each changed line to an unambiguous prior commit. For
every change that can be mapped cleanly, the uncommitted changes are
<em>absorbed</em> into the appropriate prior commit. Commits impacted by the
operation are rebased automatically. If a change cannot be mapped to an
unambiguous prior commit, it is left uncommitted and users can fall back
to an existing workflow (e.g. using <code>hg histedit</code>).</p>
<p>But wait - there's more!</p>
<p>The automatic rewriting logic of <code>hg absorb</code> is implemented by following
the history of lines. This is fundamentally different from the approach
taken by <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase</code>, which tend to rely on <em>merge
strategies</em> based on the
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4129049/why-is-a-3-way-merge-advantageous-over-a-2-way-merge">3-way merge</a>
to derive a new version of a file given multiple input versions. This
approach combined with the fact that <code>hg absorb</code> skips over changes with
an ambiguous application commit means that <strong><code>hg absorb</code> will never
encounter merge conflicts</strong>! Now, you may be thinking <em>if you ignore
lines with ambiguous application targets, the patch would always apply
cleanly using a classical 3-way merge</em>. This statement logically sounds
correct. But it isn't: <code>hg absorb</code> can avoid merge conflicts when the
merging performed by <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> would fail.</p>
<p>The above example attempts to exercise such a use case. Focusing on the
initial change:</p>

<p>When we use <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> to rewrite this history, the VCS
would first attempt to re-order commits before squashing 2 commits together.
When we attempt to reorder the <em>fixup</em> diff immediately after the commit that
introduces it, there is a good chance your VCS tool would encounter a merge
conflict. Essentially your VCS is thinking <em>you changed this line but the
lines around the change in the final version are different from the lines
in the initial version: I don't know if those other lines matter and therefore
I don't know what the end state should be, so I'm giving up and letting the
user choose for me</em>.</p>
<p>But since <code>hg absorb</code> operates at the line history level, it knows that this
individual line wasn't actually changed (even though the lines around it did),
assumes there is no conflict, and offers to <em>absorb</em> the change. So not only
is <code>hg absorb</code> significantly simpler than today's <code>hg histedit</code> or
<code>git rebase -i</code> workflows in terms of VCS command interactions, but it can
also avoid time-consuming merge conflict resolution as well!</p>
<p>Another feature of <code>hg absorb</code> is that all the rewriting occurs in memory
and the working directory is not touched when running the command. This means
that the operation is fast (working directory updates often account for a lot
of the execution time of <code>hg histedit</code> or <code>git rebase</code> commands). It also means
that tools looking at the last modified time of files (e.g. build systems
like GNU Make) won't rebuild extra (unrelated) files that were touched
as part of updating the working directory to an old commit in order to apply
changes. This makes <code>hg absorb</code> more friendly to edit-compile-test-commit
loops and allows developers to be more productive.</p>
<p>And that's <code>hg absorb</code> in a nutshell.</p>
<p>When I first saw a demo of <code>hg absorb</code> at a Mercurial developer meetup, my
jaw - along with those all over the room - hit the figurative floor. I thought
it was magical and too good to be true. I thought Facebook (the original authors
of the feature) were trolling us with an impossible demo. But it was all real.
And now <code>hg absorb</code> is available in the core Mercurial distribution for anyone
to use.  </p>
<p>From my experience, <code>hg absorb</code> <em>just works</em> almost all of the time: I run
the command and it maps all of my uncommitted changes to the appropriate
commit and there's nothing more for me to do! In a word, it is magical.</p>
<p>To use <code>hg absorb</code>, you'll need to activate the <code>absorb</code> extension. Simply
put the following in your <code>hgrc</code> config file:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
absorb =
</code></pre>
<p><code>hg absorb</code> is currently an experimental feature. That means there is
no commitment to backwards compatibility and some rough edges are
expected. I also anticipate new features (such as <code>hg absorb --interactive</code>)
will be added before the experimental label is removed. If you encounter
problems or want to leave comments, <a href="https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mercurial">file a bug</a>,
make noise in <code>#mercurial</code> on Freenode, or
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ContributingChanges">submit a patch</a>.
But don't let the <em>experimental</em> label scare you away from using it:
<code>hg absorb</code> is being used by some large install bases and also by many
of the Mercurial core developers. The <em>experimental</em> label is mainly there
because it is a brand new feature in core Mercurial and the <em>experimental</em>
label is usually affixed to new features.</p>
<p>If you practice workflows that frequently require amending old commits, I
think you'll be shocked at how much easier <code>hg absorb</code> makes these workflows.
I think you'll find it to be a game changer: once you use <code>hg abosrb</code>, you'll
soon wonder how you managed to get work done without it.</p>

  <p>Over the past several months, a handful of people had been complaining
that Mercurial's test harness was executing much slower on Macs. But
this slowdown seemingly wasn't occurring on Linux or Windows. And not
every Mac user experienced the slowness!</p>
<p>Before jetting off to the Mercurial 4.8 developer meetup in Stockholm
a few weeks ago, I sat down with a relatively fresh 6+6 core MacBook Pro
and experienced the problem firsthand: on my 4+4 core i7-6700K running
Linux, the Mercurial test harness completes in ~12 minutes, but on this
MacBook Pro, it was executing in ~38 minutes! On paper, this result
doesn't make any sense because there's no way that the MacBook Pro should
be ~3x slower than that desktop machine.</p>
<p>Looking at Activity Monitor when running the test harness with 12 tests
in parallel revealed something odd: the system was spending ~75% of overall
CPU time inside the kernel! When reducing the number of tests that ran in
parallel, the percentage of CPU time spent in the kernel decreased and
the overall test harness execution time also decreased. This kind of
behavior is usually a sign of something very inefficient in kernel land.</p>
<p>I sample profiled all processes on the system when running the Mercurial
test harness. Aggregate thread stacks revealed a common pattern:
<code>readdir()</code> being in the stack.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the stacks, <code>readdir()</code> calls into
<code>apfs_vnop_readdir()</code>, which calls into some functions with <code>bt</code> or
<code>btree</code> in their name, which call into <code>lck_mtx_lock()</code>,
<code>lck_mtx_lock_grab_mutex()</code> and various other functions with
<code>lck_mtx</code> in their name. And the caller of most <code>readdir()</code> appeared
to be Python 2.7's module importing mechanism (notably
<code>import.c:case_ok()</code>).</p>
<p>APFS refers to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">Apple File System</a>,
which is a filesystem that Apple introduced in 2017 and is the
default filesystem for new versions of macOS and iOS. If upgrading an
old Mac to a new macOS, its HFS+ filesystems would be automatically
converted to APFS.</p>
<p>While the source code for APFS is not available for me to confirm, the
profiling results showing excessive time spent in
<code>lck_mtx_lock_grab_mutex()</code> combined with the fact that execution time
decreases when the parallel process count decreases leads me to the
conclusion that <strong>APFS obtains a global kernel lock during read-only
operations such as <code>readdir()</code></strong>. In other words, APFS slows down when
attempting to perform parallel read-only I/O.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time I've encountered such behavior in a
filesystem: last year I
<a href="/blog/2017/12/08/good-riddance-to-aufs/">blogged about very similar behavior in AUFS</a>,
which was making Firefox CI significantly slower.</p>
<p>Because Python 2.7's module importing mechanism was triggering the
slowness by calling <code>readdir()</code>, I
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">posted to python-dev</a>
about the problem, as I thought it was important to notify the larger
Python community. After all, this is a generic problem that affects
the performance of starting <em>any</em> Python process when running on APFS.
i.e. if your build system invokes many Python processes in parallel,
you could be impacted by this. As part of obtaining data for that post, I
discovered that Python 3.7 does not call <code>readdir()</code> as part of
module importing and therefore doesn't exhibit a severe slowdown. (Python's
module importing code was rewritten significantly in Python 3 and the <em>fix</em>
was likely introduced well before Python 3.7.)</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://gist.github.com/indygreg/a50e187f5372807cdcab5ac12bc2feea">produced a gist that can reproduce the problem</a>.
The script essentially performs a recursive directory walk. It exercises
the <code>opendir()</code>, <code>readdir()</code>, <code>closedir()</code>, and <code>lstat()</code> functions
heavily and is essentially a benchmark of the filesystem and filesystem
cache's ability to return file metadata.</p>
<p>When you tell it to walk a very large directory tree - say a Firefox
version control checkout (which has over 250,000 files) - the excessive
time spent in the kernel is very apparent on macOS 10.13 High Sierra:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>It is apparent that macOS 10.14 Mojave has received performance work
relative to macOS 10.13! Overall kernel CPU time when performing parallel
directory walks has decreased substantially - to ~50% of original on some
invocations! Stacks seem to reveal new code for lock acquisition, so this
might indicate generic improvements to the kernel's locking mechanism
rather than APFS specific changes. Changes to file metadata caching could
also be responsible for performance changes. Although it is difficult to tell
without access to the APFS source code. Despite those improvements, APFS
is still spending a lot of CPU time in the kernel. And the kernel CPU time
is still comparatively very high compared to Linux/EXT4, even for single
process operation.</p>
<p>At this time, I haven't conducted a comprehensive analysis of APFS to
determine what other filesystem operations seem to acquire global kernel
locks: all I know is <code>readdir()</code> does. A casual analysis of profiled
stacks when running Mercurial's test harness against Python 3.7 seems
to show <code>apfs_*</code> functions still on the stack a lot and that seemingly
indicates more APFS slowness under parallel I/O load. But HFS+ exhibited
similar problems (it appeared HFS+ used a single I/O thread inside the
kernel for many operations, making I/O on macOS pretty bad), so I'm
not sure if these could be considered <em>regressions</em> the way <code>readdir()</code>'s
new behavior is.</p>
<p>I've reported this issue to Apple at
<a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/web/?problemID=45648013">https://bugreport.apple.com/web/?problemID=45648013</a>
and on OpenRadar at <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5025294012383232">https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5025294012383232</a>.
I'm told that issues get more attention from Apple when there are many
duplicates of the same issue. So please reference this issue if you file your
own report.</p>
<p>Now that I've elaborated on the technical details, I'd like to add some
personal commentary. While this post is about APFS, this issue of global
kernel locks during common I/O operations is not unique to APFS. I
<a href="/blog/2017/12/08/good-riddance-to-aufs/">already referenced</a> similar
issues in AUFS. And I've encountered similar behaviors with Btrfs (although
I can't recall exactly which operations). And NTFS has its own
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/873#issuecomment-425272829">bag of problems</a>.</p>
<p>This seeming pattern of global kernel locks for common filesystem operations
and slow filesystems is really rubbing me the wrong way. Modern NVMe SSDs
are capable of reading and writing well over 2 gigabytes per second and
performing hundreds of thousands of I/O operations per second. We even have
Intel soon producing
<a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/re-architecting-data-center-memory-storage-hierarchy/">persistent solid state storage that plugs into DIMM slots</a>
because it is that friggin fast.</p>
<p>Today's storage hardware is capable of ludicrous performance. It is fast enough
that you will likely saturate multiple CPU cores processing the read or written
data coming from and going to storage - especially if you are using higher-level,
non-JITed (read: slower) programming languages (like Python). There has also been
a trend that systems are growing more CPU cores faster than they are instructions
per second per core. And SSDs only achieve these ridiculous IOPS numbers if many
I/O operations are <em>queued</em> and can be more efficiently dispatched within the
storage device. What this all means is that it probably makes sense to use
parallel I/O across multiple threads in order to extract all potential
performance from your persistent storage layer.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that we now have solid state storage that outperforms (in
some dimensions) what DRAM from ~20 years ago was capable of. Put another way I/O
APIs and even some filesystems were designed in an era when its RAM was slower than
what today's persistent storage is capable of! While I'm no filesystems or kernel
expert, it does seem a bit silly to be using APIs and filesystems designed for an
era when storage was multiple orders of magnitude slower and systems only had a
single CPU core.</p>
<p>My takeaway is I can't help but feel that systems-level software (including the
kernel) is severely limiting the performance potential of modern storage
devices. If we have e.g. global kernel locks when performing common I/O operations,
there's no chance we'll come close to harnessing the full potential of today's
storage hardware. Furthermore, the behavior of filesystems is woefully under
documented and software developers have little solid advice for how to achieve
optimal I/O performance. As someone who cares about performance, I want to
squeeze every iota of potential out of hardware. But the lack of documentation
telling me which operations acquire locks, which strategies are best for say
reading or writing 10,000 files using N threads, etc makes this extremely
difficult. And even if this documentation existed, because of differences in
behavior across filesystems and operating systems and the difficulty in
programmatically determining the characteristics of filesystems at run time,
it is practically impossible to design a <em>one size fits all</em> approach to
high performance I/O.</p>
<p>The filesystem is a powerful concept. I want to agree and use the <em>everything is a
file</em> philosophy. Unfortunately, filesystems don't appear to be scaling very well
to support the potential of modern day storage technology. We're probably at the
point where commodity priced solid state storage is far more capable than today's
software for the majority of applications. Storage hardware manufacturers will
keep producing faster and faster storage and their marketing teams will keep
convincing us that we need to buy it. But until software catches up, chances are
most of us won't come close to realizing the true potential of modern storage
hardware. And that's even true for specialized applications that do employ tricks
taking hundreds or thousands of person hours to implement in order to eek out every
iota of performance potential. The average software developer and application
using filesystems as they were designed to be used has little to no chance of
coming close to utilizing the performance potential of modern storage devices.
That's really a shame. </p>
