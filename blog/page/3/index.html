  <p>I see a number of open source projects supporting old versions
of Python. Mercurial supports 2.4, for example. I have to ask: why do
projects continue to support old Python releases?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.4.6/">Python 2.4</a> was last
  released on December 19, 2008 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.5.6/">Python 2.5</a> was last
  released on May 26, 2011 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.5</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.9/">Python 2.6</a> was last
  released on October 29, 2013 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.6</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Everything before Python 2.7 is end-of-lifed</strong></li>
<li>Python 2.7 continues to see periodic releases, but mostly for bug fixes.</li>
<li>Practically all of the work on CPython is happening in the 3.3 and 3.4
  branches. Other implementations continue to support 2.7.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 has been available since July 2010</li>
<li>Python 2.7 provides some very compelling language features over
  earlier releases that developers want to use</li>
<li>It's much easier to write dual compatible 2/3 Python when 2.7 is the
  only 2.x release considered.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 can be installed in userland relatively easily (see
  projects like <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these facts, I'm not sure why projects insist on supporting old
and end-of-lifed Python releases.</p>
<p><strong>I think maintainers of Python projects should seriously consider
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below.</strong> Are there really that many
people on systems that don't have Python 2.7 easily available? Why are
we Python developers inflicting so much pain on ourselves to support
antiquated Python releases?</p>
<p>As a data point, I successfully transitioned Firefox's build system
from requiring Python 2.5+ to 2.7.3+ and it was relatively
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/djN02O03APc/OS8A9LuHX0sJ">pain</a>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870420">free</a>.
Sure, a few people complained. But as far as I know, not very many new
developers are coming in and complaining about the requirement.
If we can do it with a few thousand developers, I'm guessing your
project can as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-01-09 16:05:00 PST</strong>: This post is being discussed on
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/01/09/1940232/why-do-projects-continue-to-support-old-python-releases">Slashdot</a>. A lot of the comments
talk about Python 3. Python 3 is its own set of
considerations. The intended focus of this post is strictly about
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below. Python 3 is related
in that porting Python 2.x to Python 3 is much easier the higher
the Python 2.x version. This especially holds true when you want
to write Python that works simultaneously in both 2.x and 3.x.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>There is a common practice at Mozilla for developing patches with
multiple parts. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think it's a best
practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller, self-contained patches are much easier to grok and
  review than larger patches.</li>
<li>Smaller patches can land as soon as they are reviewed. Larger patches
  tend to linger and get bit rotted.</li>
<li>Smaller patches contribute to a culture of being fast and nimble, not
  slow and lethargic. This helps with developer confidence, community
  contributions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some downsides to multiple, smaller patches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bigger picture is harder to understand until all parts of a
  logical patch series are shared. (This can be alleviated through
  commit messages or reviewer notes documenting future intentions.
  And of course reviewers can delay review until they are comfortable.)</li>
<li>There is more overhead to maintain the patches (rebasing, etc).
  IMO the solutions provided by Mercurial and Git are sufficient.</li>
<li>The process overhead for dealing with multiple patches and/or bugs
  can be non-trivial. (I would like to think good tooling coupled with
  continuous revisiting of policy decisions is sufficient to counteract
  this.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the prevailing practice at Mozilla seems to be that multiple
patches related to the same logical change are attached to the same
bug. I would like to challenge the effectiveness of this practice.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>An individual commit to Firefox should be standalone and should not
  rely on future commits to unbust it (i.e. bisects to any commit should
  be safe).</li>
<li>Bugzilla has no good mechanism to isolate review comments from
  multiple attachments on the same bug, making deciphering simultaneous
  reviews on multiple attachments difficult and frustrating. This leads
  to review comments inevitably falling through the cracks and the
  quality of code suffering.</li>
<li>Reiterating the last point because it's important.</li>
</ul>
<p>I therefore argue that attaching multiple reviews to a single Bugzilla
bug is not a best practice and it should be avoided if possible. If that
means filing separate bugs for each patch, so be it. That process can
be automated. Tools like
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/tmielczarek_mozilla.com/bzexport">bzexport</a>
already do it. Alternatively (and even better IMO), we ditch
Bugzilla's code review interface (Splinter) and integrate something like
<a href="https://reviewboard.allizom.org/">ReviewBoard</a> instead. We limit
Bugzilla to tracking, high-level discussion, and metadata aggregation.
Code review happens elsewhere, without all the clutter and chaos that
Bugzilla brings to the table.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <p>I have a number of Python projects and tools that interact with
various Mozilla services. I had authored clients for all these services
as standalone Python modules so they could be reused across projects.</p>
<p>I have consolidated all these Python modules into a unified source
control
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/python-mozautomation">repository</a>
and have made the project available on
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mozautomation">PyPI</a>. You can install it
by running:</p>
<p>$ pip install mozautomation</p>
<p>Currently included in the Python package are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client for <a href="https://treestatus.mozilla.org/">treestatus.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>Module for extracting cookies from Firefox profiles (useful for
  programmatically getting Bugzilla auth credentials).</li>
<li>A client for reading and interpretting the
  <a href="http://builddata.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildjson/">JSON dumps of automation jobs</a></li>
<li>An interface to a SQLite database to manage associations between
  Mercurial changesets, bugs, and pushes.</li>
<li>Rudimentary parsing of commit messages to extract bugs and reviewers.</li>
<li>A client to obtain information about Firefox releases via the
  <a href="http://releases-api.mozilla.org/">releases API</a></li>
<li>A module defining common Firefox source repositories, aliases, logical
  groups (e.g. twigs and integration trees), and APIs for fetching
  pushlog data.</li>
<li>A client for the <a href="https://secure.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildapi/self-serve/">self serve API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation and testing is currently sparse. Things aren't up to my
regular high quality standard. But something is better than nothing.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The subject of where to host version control repositories comes up a lot
at Mozilla. It takes many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should move the Firefox repository to GitHub</li>
<li>I should be allowed to commit to GitHub</li>
<li>I want the canonical repository to be hosted by Bitbucket</li>
</ul>
<p>When Firefox development is concerned, Release Engineerings puts down
their foot and insists the canonical repository be hosted by Mozilla,
under a Mozilla hostname. When that's not possible, they set up a mirror
on Mozilla infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/jenkinsci-dev/-myjRIPcVwU/discussion">recent issue with the Jenkins project</a>
demonstrates why hosting your own version control server is important.
The gist is someone force pushed to a bunch of repos hosted on GitHub.
They needed to involve GitHub support to recover from the issue. While
it appears they largely recovered (and GitHub support deserves kudos - I
don't want to take away from their excellence), this problem would have
been avoided or the response time significantly decreased if the Jenkins
people had direct control over the Git server: they either could have
installed a custom hook that would have prevented the pushes or had
access to the reflog so they could have easily seen the last pushed
revision and easily forced pushed back to it. GitHub doesn't have a
mechanism for defining pre-* hooks, doesn't allow defining custom
hooks (a security and performance issue for them), and doesn't
expose the reflog data.</p>
<p>Until repository hosting services expose full repository data (such as
reflogs) and allow you to define custom hooks, accidents like these will
happen and the recovery time will be longer than if you hosted the repo
yourself.</p>
<p>It's possible repository hosting services like GitHub and Bitbucket will
expose these features or provide a means to quickly recover. If so,
kudos to them. But larger, more advanced projects will likely employ
custom hooks and considering custom hooks are a massive security and
performance issue for any hosted service provider, I'm not going to
hold my breath this particular feature is rolled out any time soon.
This is unfortunate, as it makes projects seemingly choose between
low risk/low convenience and GitHub's vibrant developer community.</p>

  <p><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> 2.8 has been released.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_2.8_.282013-11-1.29">changes</a>
aren't as sexy as previous releases. But there are a handful of bug
fixes that seem useful to pull in. People may also find the new <em>shelve</em>
extension useful.</p>
<p>I encourage Mozillians to keep their Mercurial up to date. I once went
around the San Francisco office and stood behind people as they
upgraded to a modern Mercurial. For the next few weeks I was hearing a
lot of "OMG Mercurial is so much better now." Don't handicap yourself by
running an older, buggy Mercurial.</p>
<p>If you don't yet feel comfortable running 2.8, 2.7 should be safe.</p>
