  <p>A lot of people contributed some really great feedback about MozReview
at Whistler. One of the most frequent requests was for the ability to
publish submitted review requests without having to open a browser.
I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday, this feature is implemented!
If reviewers have been assigned to all your review requests, Mercurial
will now prompt you to publish the review requests during <em>hg push</em>.
It should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we also introduced more advanced feature
negotiation into the handshake between client and server. This means
we now have a mechanism for detecting out-of-date client installations.
This will enable us to more aggressively drop backwards compatibility
(making server-side development easier) while simultaneously ensuring
that more people are running modern and hopefully better versions of the
client code. This should translate to moving faster and a better
experience for everyone.</p>

  <p>Just a few minutes ago, I deployed some updates to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to display more
metadata on changeset pages. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4b69a62d1905">4b69a62d1905</a>,
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4023d54436">dc4023d54436</a>,
and <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b617a57d6bf1">b617a57d6bf1</a>
for examples of what's shown.</p>
<p>We currently display:</p>
<ul>
<li>More detailed pushlog info. (Before you had to load another page to
  see things like the date of the push.)</li>
<li>The list of reviewers, each being a link that searches for other
  changesets they've reviewed.</li>
<li>A concise list of bugs referenced in the commit message.</li>
<li>Links to changesets that were backed out by this changeset.</li>
<li>On changesets that were backed out, we <em>may</em> also display a message
  that the changeset was backed out.</li>
<li>For Firefox repos, we also display the application <em>milestone</em>. This
  is the Gecko/app version recorded in the <em>config/milestone.txt</em> file
  in that changeset. The value can be used to quickly answer the
  question <em>What versions of Firefox have this changeset.</em></li>

<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>.</p>
<p>This work is built on top of a feature I added to Mercurial 3.4 to make
it easier to inject extra data into Mercurial's web templates. We just
deployed Mercurial 3.4.1 to hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It's worth noting
that this deployment happened in the middle of the day with no
user-perceived downtime. This is a far cry from where we were a year
ago, when any server change required a maintenance window. We've
invested a lot of work into a test suite for this service so we can
continuously deploy without fear of breaking things. Moving fast feels
so good.</p>

  <p>This was a busy week for MozReview! There are a number of changes people
need to be aware of.</p>
<h2>Support for Specifying Reviewers via Commit Messages</h2>
<p>MozReview will now parse <strong>r?gps</strong> syntax out of commit messages to
set reviewers for pushed commits.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/review-requests.html#specifying-reviewers-in-commit-messages">Read the docs</a>
for more information, including why we are preferring <strong>r?</strong> to <strong>r=</strong>.</p>
<p>Since it landed, a number of workflow concerns have been reported.
See the bug tree for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1142251">bug 1142251</a>
before filing a bug to help avoid duplicates.</p>
<p>Thank Dan Minor for the feature!</p>
<h2>Review Attachment/Flag Per Commit</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of MozReview, there was one Bugzilla attachment /
review flag per commit series. This has changed to one attachment /
review flag per commit.</p>
<p>Before, you needed to grant <em>Ship It</em> on the parent/root review request
in order to r+ the MozReview review request. Now, you grant <em>Ship It</em>
on individual commits and these turn into individual r+ on Bugzilla.
To reinforce that reviewing the parent/root review request doesn't do
anything meaningful any more, the <em>Ship It</em> button and checkbox have been
removed from the parent/root review request.</p>
<p>The new model more closely maps to how code review in Bugzilla has
worked at Mozilla for ages. And, it is a superior workflow for
future workflows we're trying to enable.</p>
<p>We tried to run a one-time migration script to convert existing
parent/root attachments/review flags to per-commit attachments/flags.
However, there were issues. We will attempt again sometime next week.
In the interim, <strong>in-flight review requests may enter an inconsistent
state if they are updated</strong>. If a new push is performed, the old
parent/root attachment/review flag may linger and per-commit
attachments/flags will be created. This could be confusing. The
workaround is to manually clear the r? flag from the parent/root
attachment or wait for the migration script to run in a few days.</p>
<p>Mark Côté put in a lot of hard work to make this change happen.</p>
<h2>r? Flags Cleared After Review</h2>
<p>Before, submitting a review without granting <em>Ship It</em> wouldn't do
anything to the r? flag: the r? flag would linger.</p>
<p>Now, submitting review without granting <em>Ship It</em> will clear the r?
flag. We think the new default is better for the majority of users.
However, we recognize it isn't always wanted. There is a bug open to
provide a checkbox to keep the r? flag present.</p>
<h2>Metadata Added to Changesets</h2>
<p>If you update to the tip of the version-control-tools repository
(you should do this every week or so to stay fresh - use <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em> to do this automatically), metadata will automatically
be added to commits when working with MozReview-enabled repositories.</p>
<p>Specifically, we insert a hidden, unique, random ID into every changeset.
This ID can be used to map commits to each other. We don't use this ID
yet. But we have plans.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this change is that you can no longer push to MozReview
if you have uncommitted local changes. If this is annoying, use <em>hg
shelve</em> and <em>hg unshelve</em> to create and undo temporary commits. If this
is too annoying, complain by filing a bug and we can look into doing
this automatically as part of pushing.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>We're actively working on more workflow enhancements to make MozReview
an even more compelling experience.</p>
<p>I'm building a web service to query file metadata from moz.build files.
This will allow MozReview to automatically file bugs in proper
components based on what files changed. Once code reviewer metadata
is added to moz.build files, it will enable us to assign reviewers
automatically as well. The end goal here is to lower the number of steps
needed to turn changed code into a landing. This will be useful when we
turn GitHub pull requests into MozReview review requests (random GitHub
contributors shouldn't need to know who to flag for review, nor should
they be required to file a bug if they write some code). Oh year, we're
working on integrating GitHub pull requests.</p>
<p>Another area of focus is better commit tracking and partially landed
series. I have preliminary patches for automatically adding review URL
annotations to commit messages. This will enable people to easily go
from commit (message) to MozReview, without having to jump through
Bugzilla. This also enables better commit tracking. If you e.g.
perform complicated history rewriting, the review URL annotation will
enable the MozReview server to better map previously-submitted commits
to existing review requests. Partially landed series will enable
commits to land as soon as they are reviewed, without having to wait
on the entire series. It's my strong belief that if a commit is granted
review, it should land as soon as possible. This helps prevent bit rot
of ready-to-land commits. Landings also make people feel better because
you feel like you've accomplished something. Positive feedback loops are
good.</p>
<p>Major work is also being done to overhaul the web UI. The commit series
view (which is currently populated via XHR) will soon be generated on
the server and served as part of the page. This should make pages load a
bit faster. And, things should be prettier as well.</p>
<p>And, of course, work is being invested into Autoland. Support for
submitting pushes to Try landed a few weeks ago. Having Autoland
actually land reviewed commits is on the radar.</p>
<p>Exciting times are ahead. Please continue to provide feedback. If you
see something, <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hacking-mozreview.html#filing-bugs">say something</a>.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When you type <em>hg clone</em>, the Mercurial server will create a <em>bundle</em>
from repository content at the time of the request and stream it to
the client. (Git works essentially the same way.)</p>
<p>This approach usually <em>just works</em>. But there are some downsides,
particularly with large repositories.</p>
<p>Creating bundles for large repositories is not cheap. For
mozilla-central, Firefox's main repository, it takes ~280s of CPU time
on my 2014 MacBook Pro to generate a bundle. Every time a client runs a
<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>, a server somewhere
is spinning a CPU core generating ~1.1 GB of data. What's more, if
another clone arrives at the same time, another process will perform
the exact same work! When we talk about multiple minutes of CPU time
per request, this extra work starts to add up.</p>
<p>Another problem with large repositories is interrupted downloads. If
you suffer a connectivity blip during your <em>clone</em> command, you'll
have to start from scratch. This potentially means re-transferring
hundreds of megabytes from the server. It also means the server has
to generate a new bundle, consuming even more CPU time. This is not
good for the user or the server.</p>
<p>There have been multiple outages of hg.mozilla.org as a result of
the service being flooded with clone requests to large repositories.
Dozens of clients (most of them in Firefox or Firefox OS
release automation) have cloned the same repository around the same
time and overwhelmed network bandwidth in the data center or CPU
cores on the Mercurial servers.</p>
<p>A common solution to this problem is to not use the <em>clone</em> command
to receive initial repository data from the server. Instead, a
static <em>bundle</em> file will be generated and made available to clients.
Clients will call <em>hg init</em> to create an empty repository then will
perform an <em>hg unbundle</em> to apply the contents of a pre-generated
bundle file. They will then run <em>hg pull</em> to fetch new data that
was created after the bundle was generated. (It's worth noting that
Git's <em>clone --reference</em> option is similar.)</p>
<p>This is a good technical solution. Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation have effectively implemented this. However, it is a lot of
work: you have to build your own bundle generation and hosting
infrastructure and you have to remember that every <em>hg clone</em> should
probably be using bundles instead. It is extra complexity and complexity
that must be undertaken by every client. If a client forgets, the
consequences can be disastrous (clone flooding leading to service
outage). Client-side opt-in is prone to lapses and doesn't scale.</p>
<p><strong>As of today, we've deployed a more scalable, server-based solution to
hg.mozilla.org.</strong></p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org is now itself generating bundles for a handful of
repositories, including mozilla-central, inbound, fx-team, and
mozharness. These bundles are being uploaded to Amazon S3. And
<strong>those bundles are being advertised by the server over Mercurial's
wire protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>When you install the <em>bundleclone</em> Mercurial extension, <em>hg clone</em> is
taught to look for bundles being advertised on the server. If a bundle
is available, the bundle is downloaded, applied, and then the client
does the equivalent of an <em>hg pull</em> to fetch all new data since when the
bundle was generated. If a bundle exists, it is used transparently: no
client side cooperation is needed beyond installing the <em>bundleclone</em>
extension. If a bundle doesn't exist, it simply falls back to
Mercurial's default behavior. <strong>This effectively shifts responsibility
for doing efficient clones from clients to server operators, which
means server operators don't need cooperation from clients to enact
important service changes.</strong> Before, if clients weren't using bundles,
we'd have to wait for clients to update their code. Now, we can see
a repository is being cloned heavily and start generating bundles for
it without having to wait for the client to deploy new code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we've built primitive <em>content negotiation</em> into the
process. The server doesn't simply advertise one bundle file: it
advertises several bundle files. We offer gzip, bzip2, and <em>stream</em>
bundles. gzip is what Mercurial uses by default. It works OK. bzip2
bundles are smaller, but they take longer to process. <em>stream</em> bundles
are essentially tar archives of the <em>.hg/store</em> directory and are larger
than gzip bundles, but insanely fast because there is very little CPU
required to apply them. In addition, we advertise URLs for multiple S3
regions, currently us-west-2 (Oregon) and us-east-1 (Virginia). This
enables clients to prefer the bundle most appropriate for them.</p>
<p>A benefit of serving bundles from S3 is that Firefox and Firefox OS
release automation (the biggest consumers of hg.mozilla.org) live in
Amazon EC2. They are able to fetch from S3 over a gigabit network.
And, since we're transferring data within the same AWS region, there
are no data transfer costs. Previously, we were transferring ~1.1 GB
from a Mozilla data center to EC2 for each clone. This took up bandwidth
in Mozilla's network and cost Mozilla money to send data thousands of
miles away. And, we never came close to saturating a gigabit network (we
do with stream bundles). Wins everywhere!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">full instructions</a>
detail how to use <em>bundleclone</em>. <strong>I recommend everyone at Mozilla
install the extension</strong> because there should be no downside to doing it.</p>
<p>Once <em>bundleclone</em> is deployed to Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation, we should hopefully never again see those machines bring
down hg.mozilla.org due to a flood of clone requests. We should also
see a drastic reduction in load to hg.mozilla.org. I'm optimistic
bandwidth will decrease by over 50%!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the functionality from the <em>bundleclone</em> extension
is coming to vanilla Mercurial. The functionality (which was initially
added by Mozilla's Mike Hommey) is part of Mercurial's <em>bundle2</em> protocol,
which is available, but isn't enabled by default yet. <em>bundleclone</em> is thus
a temporary solution to bring us server stability and client
improvements until modern Mercurial versions are deployed everywhere
in a few months time.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to credit Augie Fackler for the
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.devel/54872/focus=54872">original idea</a>
for server-assisted bundle-based clones.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When Firefox made the switch from CVS to Mercurial in March 2007, the
CVS history wasn't imported into Mercurial. There were good reasons for
this at the time. But it's a decision that continues to have
side-effects. I am surprised how often I hear of engineers wanting to
access blame and commit info from commits now more than 9 years old!</p>
<p>When individuals created a Git mirror of the Firefox repository a few
years ago, they correctly decided that importing CVS history would be
a good idea. They also correctly decided to combine the logically same
but physically separate <em>release</em> and <em>integration</em> repositories into a
unified Git repository. These are things we can't easily do to the
canonical Mercurial repository because it would break SHA-1 hashes,
breaking many systems, and it would require significant changes in
process, among other reasons.</p>
<p>While Firefox developers do have access to a single Firefox repository
with full CVS history (the Git mirror), they still aren't satisfied.</p>
<p>Running <em>git blame</em> (or <em>hg blame</em> for that matter) can be very
expensive. For this reason, the blame interface is disabled on many
web-based source viewers by default. On GitHub, some blame URLs for
the Firefox repository time out and cause GitHub to display an error
message. No matter how hard you try, you can't easily get blame results
(running a local Git HTTP/HTML interface is still difficult compared to
<em>hg serve</em>).</p>
<p>Another reason developers aren't satisfied with the Git mirror is that
Git's querying tools pale in comparison to Mercurial's. I've said it
before and I'll say it again: Mercurial's revision sets and templates
are incredibly useful features that enable advanced repository querying
and reporting. Git's offerings come nowhere close. (I <em>really</em> wish Git
would steal these awesome features from Mercurial.)</p>
<p>Anyway, enough people were complaining about the lack of a Mercurial
Firefox repository with full CVS history that I decided to create one.
If you point your browsers or Mercurial clients to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full">https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full</a>,
you'll be able to access it.</p>
<p>The process used for the conversion was the simplest possible: I used
hg-git to convert the Git mirror back to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Unlike the Git mirror, I didn't include all heads in this new
repository. Instead, there is only mozilla-central's head (the current
development tip). If I were doing this properly, I'd include all heads,
like
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-aggregate">gecko-aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>I'm well aware there are oddities in the Git mirror and they now
exist in this new repository as well. My goal for this conversion was to
deliver something: it wasn't a goal to deliver the most correct result
possible.</p>
<p>At this time, this repository should be considered an unstable science
experiment. <strong>By no means should you rely on this repository.</strong> But if
you find it useful, I'd appreciate hearing about it. If enough people
ask, we could probably make this more official.</p>
