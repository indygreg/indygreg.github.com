  <p>You may have noticed the Firefox trees
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">were closed</a>
for the better part of yesterday.</p>
<p>Long story short, a file containing URLs for Firefox installers was
updated to reference https://ftp.mozilla.org/ from
http://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/. The original, latter
host is a CDN. The former is not. When thousands of clients started
hitting ftp.mozilla.org, it overwhelmed the servers and network,
causing timeouts and other badness.</p>
<p>The change in question was accidental. It went through code review.
From a code change standpoint, procedures were followed.</p>
<p>It is tempting to point fingers at the people involved. However, I
want us to consider placing blame elsewhere: on the code review
tool.</p>
<p>The diff being reviewed was to change the Firefox version number
from 32.0 to 32.0.3. If you were asked to review this
patch, I'm guessing your eyes would have glanced over everything in the
URL except the version number part. I'm pretty sure mine would have.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what the reviewer saw in Bugzilla/Splinter (click
to see full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-splinter.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-splinter.png" width="600" />
</a></p>
<p>And here is what the reviewer would have seen had the review been
conducted in MozReview:</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png" width="600">
</a></p>
<p>Which tool makes the change of hostname more obvious? Bugzilla/Splinter
or MozReview?</p>
<p><strong>MozReview's support for intraline diffs more clearly draws attention to
the hostname change. I posit that had this patch been reviewed with
MozReview, the chances are greater we wouldn't have had a network
outage yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>And it isn't just intraline diffs that make Splinter/Bugzilla a
sub-optimal code review tool. I recently blogged about the
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">numerous ways that using Bugzilla for code revie results in harder
reviews and buggier
code</a>.
Every day we continue using Bugzilla/Splinter instead of investing in
better code review tools is a day severe bugs like this can and will
slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>If there is any silver lining to this outage, I hope it is that we need
to double down on our investment in developer tools, particularly code
review.</p>

  <p>Mercurial and Git both experience scaling pains as the number of heads
in a repository approaches infinity. Operations like push and pull
slow to a crawl and everyone gets frustrated.</p>
<p>This is the problem Mozilla's Try repository has been dealing with
for years. We know the solution doesn't scale. But we've been content
kicking the can by resetting the repository (blowing away data)
to make the symptoms temporarily go away.</p>
<p>One of my official goals is to ship a scalable Try solution by the end
of 2014.</p>
<p>Today, I believe I finally have enough code cobbled together to
produce a working concept. <strong>And I could use your help testing it.</strong></p>
<p>I would like people to push their Try, code review, and other
miscellaneous heads to a special repository. To do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg push -r . -f ssh://hg@hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-headless
</code></pre>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the changeset belonging to the working copy</li>
<li>Allow the creation of new heads</li>
<li>Send it to the <em>gecko-headless</em> repo on hg.gregoryszorc.com using
  SSH</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what happening.</p>
<p>I have deployed a special repository to my personal server that I
believe will behave very similarly to the final solution.</p>
<p>When you push to this repository, instead of your changesets being
applied directly to the repository, it siphons them off to a Mercurial
bundle. It then saves this bundle somewhere along with some metadata
describing what is inside.</p>
<p>When you run <em>hg pull -r <node></em> on that repository and ask for a
changeset that exists in the bundle, the server does some magic
and returns data from the bundle file.</p>
<p>Things this repository doesn't do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This repository will not actually send changesets to Try for you.</strong></li>
<li>You cannot <code>hg pull</code> or <code>hg clone</code> the repository and get all of the
  commits from bundles. This isn't a goal. It will likely never be
  supported.</li>
<li>We do not yet record a pushlog entry for pushes to the repository.</li>
<li>The hgweb HTML interface does not <strong>yet</strong> handle commits that only
  exist in bundles. People want this to work. It will eventually work.</li>
<li>Pulling from the repository over HTTP with a vanilla Mercurial install
  may not preserve phase data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this experiment is to expose the repository to some
actual traffic patterns so I can see what's going on and get a feel
for real-world performance, variability, bugs, etc. I plan to do all
of this in the testing environment. But I'd like some real-world
use on the actual Firefox repository to give me peace of mind.</p>
<p>Please report any issues directly to me. Leave a comment here. Ping
me on IRC. Send me an email. etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-11-21: People discovered a bug with pushed changesets
accidentally being advanced to the public phase, despite the repository
being non-publishing. I have fixed the issue. But you must now push to
the repository over SSH, not HTTP.</strong></p>

  <p>We had a hiccup on hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It resulted in prolonged
tree closures for Firefox.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094922">Bug 1094922</a>
tracks the issue.</p>
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>We noticed that many HTTP requests to hg.mozilla.org were getting 503
responses. On initial glance, the servers were healthy. CPU was below
100% utilization, I/O wait was reasonable. And there was little to no
swapping. Furthermore, the logs showed a healthy stream of requests
being successfully processed at levels that are typical. In other words,
it looked like business as usual on the servers.</p>
<p>Upon deeper investigation, we noticed that the WSGI process pool on the
servers was fully saturated. There were were 24 slots/processes per server
allocated to process Mercurial requests and all 24 of them were actively
processing requests. This created a backlog of requests that had been
accepted by the HTTP server but were waiting an internal dispatch/proxy
to WSGI. To the client, this would appear as a request with a long lag
before response generation.</p>
<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>This being an emergency (trees were already closed and developers were
effectively unable to use hg.mozilla.org), we decided to increase the
size of the WSGI worker pool. After all, we had CPU, I/O, and memory
capacity to spare and we could identify the root cause later. We first
bumped worker pool capacity from 24 to 36 and immediately saw a significant
reduction in the number of pending requests awaiting a WSGI worker. We
still had spare CPU, I/O, and memory capacity and were still seeing
requests waiting on a WSGI worker, so we bumped the capacity to 48
processes. At that time, we stopped seeing worker pool exhaustion and
all incoming requests were being handed off to a WSGI worker as soon as
they came in.</p>
<p>At this time, things were looking pretty healthy from the server end.</p>
<h2>Impact on Memory and Swapping</h2>
<p>Increasing the number of WSGI processes had the side-effect of
increasing the total amount of system memory used by Mercurial
processes in two ways. First, more processes means more memory. That
part is obvious. Second, more processes means fewer requests for each
process per unit of time and thus it takes longer for each process to
reach its max number of requests being being reaped. (It is a common
practice in servers to have a single process hand multiple requests.
This prevents overhead associated with spawning a new process and
loading possibly expensive context in it.)</p>
<p>We had our Mercurial WSGI processes configured to serve 100 requests
before being reaped. With the doubling of WSGI processes from 24 to 48,
those processes were lingering for 2x as long as before. Since the
Mercurial processes grow over time (they are aggressive about caching
repository data), this was slowly exhausting our memory pool.</p>
<p>It took a few hours, but a few servers started flirting with high swap
usage. (We don't expect the servers to swap.) This is how we identified
that memory use wasn't sane.</p>
<p>We lowered the maximum requests per process from 100 to 50 to match
the ratio increase in the WSGI worker pool.</p>
<h2>Mercurial Memory "Leak"</h2>
<p>When we started looking at the memory usage of WSGI processes in more
detail, we noticed something strange: RSS of Mercurial processes was
growing steadily when processes were streaming bundle data. This seemed
very odd to me. Being a Mercurial developer, I was pretty sure the
behavior was wrong.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4443">filed a bug</a> against
Mercurial.</p>
<p>I was able to reproduce the issue locally and started running a
bisection to find the regressing changeset. To my surprise, this issue
has been around since Mercurial 2.7!</p>
<p>I looked at the code in question, identified why so much memory was
being allocated, and submitted patches to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063518.html">stop an unbounded memory growth during clone/pull</a>
and to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063520.html">further reduce memory use during those operations</a>.
Both of those patches have been queued to go in the next stable release
of Mercurial, 3.2.1.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.2 is still not as memory efficient during clones as Mercurial
2.5.4. If I have time, I'd like to formulate more patches. But the
important fix - not growing memory unbounded during clone/pull - is
in place.</p>
<p>Armed with the knowledge that Mercurial is leaky (although not a leak
in the traditional sense since the memory was eventually
getting garbage collected), we further reduced the max requests per
process from 50 to 20. This will cause processes to get reaped sooner
and will be more aggressive about keeping RSS growth in check.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>We suspect the root cause of the event is a network event.</p>
<p>Before this outage, we rarely had more than 10 requests being served
from the WSGI worker pool. In other words, we were often well below 50%
capacity. But something changed yesterday. More slots were being
occupied and high-bandwidth operations were taking longer to complete.
Kendall Libby noted that outbound traffic dropped by ~800 Mbps
during the event. For reasons that still haven't been identified, the
network became slower, clones weren't being processed as quickly, and
clients were occupying WSGI processes for longer amounts of time. This
eventually exhausted the available process pool, leading to HTTP 503's,
intermittent service availability, and a tree closure.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we noticed that in-flight HTTP requests are abnormally
high again this morning. However, because the servers are now configured
to handle the extra capacity, we seem to be powering through it without
any issues.</p>
<h2>In Hindsight</h2>
<p>You can make the argument that the servers weren't configured to serve
as much traffic as possible. After all, we were able to double the
WSGI process pool without hitting CPU, I/O, and memory limits.</p>
<p>The servers were conservatively configured. However, the worker pool
was initially configured at 2x CPU core count. And as a general rule of
thumb, you don't want your worker pool to be much greater than CPU
count because that introduces context switching and can give each
individual process a smaller slice of the CPU to process requests,
leading to higher latency. Since clone operations often manage to
peg a single CPU core, there is some justification for keeping the
ratio of WSGI workers to CPU count low. Furthermore, we rarely came
close to exhausting the WSGI worker pool before. There was little
to no justification for increasing capacity to a threshold not normally
seen.</p>
<p>But at the same time, even with 4x workers to CPU cores, our CPU
usage rarely flirts with 100% across all cores, even with the
majority of workers occupied. Until we actually hit CPU (or I/O)
limits, running a high multiplier seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Long term, we expect CPU usage during clone operations to drop
dramatically. Mike Hommey has contributed a patch to Mercurial that
allows servers to hand out a URL of a bundle file to fetch during
clone. So, a server can say <em>I have your data: fetch this static file
from S3 and then apply this small subset of the data that I'll give
you.</em> When properly deployed and used at Mozilla, this will effectively
drop server-side CPU usage for clones to nothing.</p>
<h2>Where to do Better</h2>
<p>There was a long delay between the Nagios alerts firing and someone
with domain-specific knowledge looking at the problem.</p>
<p>The trees could have reopened earlier. We were pretty confident about
the state of things at 1000. Trees opened in metered mode at 1246 and
completely at 1909. Although, the swapping issue wasn't mitigated until
1615, so you can argue that being conservative on the tree reopening
was justified. There is a chance that full reopening could have
triggered excessive swap and another round of chaos for everyone
involved.</p>
<p>We need an alert on WSGI pool exhaustion. It took longer than it should
have to identify this problem. However, now that we've encountered it,
it should be obvious if/when it happens again.</p>
<p>Firefox release automation is the largest single consumer of
hg.mozilla.org. Since they are operating thousands of machines, any
reduction in interaction or increase in efficiency will result in
drastic load reductions on the server. Chris AtLee and Jordan Lund
have been working on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1050109">bug 1050109</a> to
reduce clones of the mozharness and build/tools repositories, which
should go a long way to dropping load on the server.</p>

  <p>Mozilla is very close to rolling out a new
<a href="http://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview.html">code review tool based on Review Board</a>.
When I became involved in the project, I viewed it as an opportunity to
start from a clean slate and design the ideal code development workflow
for the average Firefox developer. When the design of the code review
experience was discussed, I would push for decisions that were
compatible with my utopian end state.</p>
<p>As part of formulating the ideal workflows and design of the new tool,
I needed to investigate why we do things the way we do, whether they are
optimal, and whether they are necessary. As part of that, I spent a lot
of time thinking about Bugzilla's role in shaping the code that goes into
Firefox. This post is a summary of my findings.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this post is to dissect the practices that Bugzilla
influences and to prepare the reader for the potential to reassemble the
pieces - to change the workflows - in the future, primarily around
Mozilla's new code review tool. By showing that Bugzilla has influenced
the popularization of what I consider non-optimal practices, it is my
hope that readers start to question the existing processes and open up
their mind to change.</p>
<p>Since the impetus for this post in the near deployment of Mozilla's new
code review tool, many of my points will focus on code review.</p>
<p>Before I go into my findings, I'd like to explicitly state that while
many of the things I'm about to say may come across as negativity
towards Bugzilla, my intentions are not to put down Bugzilla or the
people who maintain it. Yes, there are limitations in Bugzilla. But I
don't think it is correct to point fingers and blame Bugzilla or its
maintainers for these limitations. I think we got where we are following
years of very gradual shifts. I don't think you can blame Bugzilla for
the circumstances that led us here. Furthermore, Bugzilla maintainers
are quick to admit the faults and limitations of Bugzilla. And, they are
adamant about and instrumental in rolling out the new code review tool,
which shifts code review <em>out</em> of Bugzilla. Again, my intent is not to
put down Bugzilla. So please don't direct ire that way yourself.</p>
<p>So, let's drill down into some of the implications of using Bugzilla.</p>
<h2>Difficult to Separate Contexts</h2>
<p>The stream of changes on a bug in Bugzilla (including review comments)
is a flat, linear list of plain text comments. This works great when the
activity of a bug follows a nice, linear, singular topic flow. However,
real bug activity does not happen this way. All but the most trivial bugs
usually involve multiple points of discussion. You typically have
discussion about what the bug is. When a patch comes along, reviewer
feedback comes in both high-level and low-level forms. Each
item in each group is its own logical discussion thread. When patches
land, you typically have points of discussion tracking the state of this
patch. Has it been tested, does it need uplift, etc.</p>
<p>Bugzilla has things like keywords, flags, comment tags, and the
whiteboard to enable some isolation of these various contexts. However,
you still have a flat, linear list of plain text comments that contain
the meat of the activity. It can be extremely difficult to follow these
many interleaved logical threads.</p>
<p>In the context of code review, lumping all review comments into the same
linear list adds overhead and undermines the process of landing the
highest-quality patch possible.</p>
<p>Review feedback consists of both high-level and low-level comments.
High-level would be things like architecture discussions. Low-level
would be comments on the code itself. When these two classes of comments
are lumped together in the same text field, I believe it is easy to
lose track of the high-level comments and focus on the low-level. After
all, you may have a short paragraph of high-level feedback right next to
a mountain of low-level comments. Your eyes and brain tend to gravitate
towards the larger set of more concrete low-level comments because you
sub-consciously want to fix your problems and that large mass of text
represents more problems, easier problems to solve than the shorter and
often more abstract high-level summary. You want instant gratification
and the pile of low-level comments is just too tempting to pass up. We
have to train ourselves to temporarily ignore the low-level comments and
focus on the high-level feedback. This is very difficult for some people.
It is not an ideal disposition.
<a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2014-10-22/how-i-do-code-reviews-at-mozilla/">Benjamin Smedberg's recent post on code
review</a>
indirectly talks about some of this by describing his rational
approach of tackling high-level first.</p>
<p>As review iterations occur, the bug devolves into a mix of comments
related to high and low-level comments. It thus becomes harder and
harder to track the current high-level state of the feedback, as they
must be picked out from the mountain of low-level comments. If you've
ever inherited someone else's half-finished bug, you know what I'm
talking about.</p>
<p>I believe that Bugzilla's threadless and contextless comment flow
disposes us towards focusing on low-level details instead of the
high-level. I believe that important high-level discussions aren't
occurring at the rate they need and that technical debt increases as a
result.</p>
<h2>Difficulty Tracking Individual Items of Feedback</h2>
<p>Code review feedback consists of multiple items of feedback. Each one is
related to the review at hand. But oftentimes each item can be
considered independent from others, relevant only to a single line or
section of code. Style feedback is one such example.</p>
<p>I find it helps to model code review as a tree. You start with one thing
you want to do. That's the root node. You split that thing into multiple
commits.  That's a new layer on your tree. Finally, each comment on those
commits and the comments on those comments represent new layers to the tree.
Code review thus consists of many related, but independent branches, all
flowing back to the same central concept or goal. There is a one to many
relationship at nearly every level of the tree.</p>
<p>Again, Bugzilla lumps all these individual items of feedback into a
linear series of flat text blobs. When you are commenting on code, you
do get some code context printed out. But everything is plain text.</p>
<p>The result of this is that tracking the progress on individual items of
feedback - individual branches in our conceptual tree - is difficult. Code
authors must pore through text comments and manually keep an inventory
of their progress towards addressing the comments. Some people copy the
review comment into another text box or text editor and delete items once
they've fixed them locally! And, when it comes time to review the new
patch version, reviewers must go through the same exercise in order to
verify that all their original points of feedback have been adequately
addressed! You've now redundantly duplicated the feedback tracking
mechanism among at least two people. That's wasteful in of itself.</p>
<p>Another consequence of this unstructured feedback tracking mechanism is
that points of feedback tend to get lost. On complex reviews, you may be
sorting through dozens of individual points of feedback. It is extremely
easy to lose track of something. This could have disastrous
consequences, such as the accidental creation of a 0day bug in Firefox.
OK, that's a worst case scenario. But I know from experience that review
comments can and do get lost. This results in new bugs being filed,
author and reviewer double checking to see if other comments were not
acted upon, and possibly severe bugs with user impacting behavior. In
other words, this unstructured tracking of review feedback tends to lessen
code quality and is thus a contributor to technical debt.</p>
<h2>Fewer, Larger Patches</h2>
<p>Bugzilla's user interface encourages the writing of fewer, larger
patches. (The opposite would be many, smaller patches - sometimes
referred to as <em>micro commits</em>.)</p>
<p>This result is achieved by a user interface that handles multiple
patches so poorly that it effectively discourages that approach, driving
people to create larger patches.</p>
<p>The stream of changes on a bug (including review comments) is
a flat, linear list of plain text comments. This works great when
the activity of a bug follows a nice, linear flow. However, reviewing
multiple patches doesn't work in a linear model. If you attach multiple
patches to a bug, the review comments and their replies for all the
patches will be interleaved in the same linear comment list. This
flies in the face of the reality that each patch/review is logically
its own thread that deserves to be followed on its own. The end result
is that it is extremely difficult to track what's going on in each
patch's review. Again, we have different contexts - different branches
of a tree - all living in the same flat list.</p>
<p>Because conducting review on separate patches is so painful, people are
effectively left with two choices: 1) write a single, monolithic patch
2) create a new bug. Both options suck.</p>
<p>Larger, monolithic patches are harder and slower to review. Larger
patches require much more cognitive load to review, as the reviewer
needs to capture the entire context in order to make a review
determination. This takes more time. The increased surface area of the
patch also increases the liklihood that the reviewer will find something
wrong and will require a re-review. The added complexity of a larger
patch also means the chances of a bug creeping in are higher, leading
to more bugs being filed and more reviews later. The more review cycles
the patch goes through, the greater the chances it will suffer from bit
rot and will need updating before it lands, possibly incurring yet more
rounds of review. And, since we measure progress in terms of code
landing, the delay to get a large patch through many rounds of review
makes us feel lethargic and demotivates us. <strong>Large patches have
intrinsic properties that lead to compounding problems and increased
development cost.</strong></p>
<p>As bad as large patches are, they are roughly in the same badness range
as the alternative: creating more bugs.</p>
<p>When you create a new bug to hold the context for the review of an
individual commit, you are doing a lot of things, very few of them
helpful. First, you must create a new bug. There's overhead to do
that. You need to type in a summary, set up the bug dependencies,
CC the proper people, update the commit message in your patch, upload
your patch/attachment to the new bug, mark the attachment on the old
bug obsolete, etc. This is arguably tolerable, especially with tools
that can automate the steps (although I don't believe there is a
single tool that does all of what I mentioned automatically). But the
badness of multiple bugs doesn't stop there.</p>
<p><strong>Creating multiple bugs fragments the knowledge and history of your
change and diminishes the purpose of a bug.</strong> You got in the situation
of creating multiple bugs because you were working on a <em>single logical
change</em>. It just so happened that you needed/wanted multiple
commits/patches/reviews to represent that singular change. That initial
change was likely tracked by a single bug. And now, because of
Bugzilla's poor user interface around mutliple patch reviews, you now
find yourself creating yet another bug. Now you have two bug
numbers - two identifiers that look identical, only
varying by their numeric value - referring to the same logical thing.
We've started with a single bug number referring to your logical
change and created what are effectively sub-issues, but allocated them
in the same namespace as <em>normal bugs</em>. We've diminished the importance
of the average bug. We've introduced confusion as to where one should go
to learn about this single, logical change. <em>Should I go to bug X or bug
Y?</em> Sure, you can likely go to one and ultimately find what you were
looking for. But that takes more effort.</p>
<p><strong>Creating separate bugs for separate reviews also makes refactoring
harder.</strong> If you are going the micro commit route, chances are you do
a lot of history rewriting. Commits are combined. Commits are split.
Commits are reordered. And if those commits are all mapping to
individual bugs, you potentially find yourself in a huge mess. Combining
commits might mean resolving bugs as duplicates of each other. Splitting
commits means creating yet another bug. And let's not forget about
managing bug dependencies. Do you set up your dependencies so you have a
linear, waterfall dependency corresponding to commit order? That
logically makes sense, but it is hard to keep in sync. Or, do you
just make all the <em>review bugs</em> depend on a single parent bug? If you do
that, how do you communicate the order of the patches to the reviewer?
Manually? That's yet more overhead. History rewriting - an operation
that modern version control tools like Git and Mercurial have enabled
to be a lightweight operation and users love because it doesn't
constrain them to pre-defined workflows - thus become much more costly.
The cost may even be so high that some people forego rewriting completely,
trading their effort for some poor reviewer who has to inherit a series of
patches that isn't organized as logically as it could be. Like larger
patches, this increases cognitive load required to perform reviews
and increases development costs.</p>
<p>As you can see, reviewing multiple, smaller patches with Bugzilla often
leads to a horrible user experience. So, we find ourselves writing
larger, monolithic patches and living with their numerous
deficiencies. At least with monolithic patches we have a predictable
outcome for how interaction with Bugzilla will play out!</p>
<p><strong>I have little doubt that large patches (whose existence is influenced
by the UI of Bugzilla) slows down the development velocity of Firefox.</strong></p>
<h2>Commit Message Formatting</h2>
<p>The heavy involvement of Bugzilla in our code development
lifecycle has influenced how we write commit messages. Let's start with
the obvious example. Here is our standard commit message format for
Firefox:</p>
<p>Bug 1234 - Fix some feature foo; r=gps</p>
<p>The bug is right there at the front of the commit message. That
prominent placement is effectively saying <strong>the bug number is the most
important detail about this commit - everything else is ancillary</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure some of you are saying, <em>but Greg, the short description
of the change is obviously more important than the bug number</em>. You are
right. But we've allowed ourselves to make the bug and the content
therein more important than the commit.</p>
<p>Supporting my theory is the commit message content following the
first/summary line. That data is almost always - wait for it -
<strong>nothing: we generally don't write commit messages that contain more
than a single summary line</strong>. My repository forensics show that that
less than 20% of commit messages to Firefox in 2014 contain multiple
lines (this excludes merge and backout commits). (We are doing better
than 2013 - the rate was less than 15% then).</p>
<p>Our commit messages are basically saying, <em>here's a highly-abbreviated
summary of the change and a pointer (a bug number) to where you can
find out more</em>. And of course loading the bug typically reveals a mass of
interleaved comments on various topics, hardly the high-level summary
you were hoping was captured in the commit message.</p>
<p>Before I go on, in case you are on the fence as to the benefit of
detailed commit messages, please read Phabricator's recommendations on
<a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/recommendations_on_revision_control/">revision control</a>
and <a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/writing_reviewable_code/">writing reviewable code</a>.
I think both write-ups are terrific and are excellent templates that
apply to nearly everyone, especially a project as large and complex as
Firefox.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are many reasons why we don't capture a detailed, multi-line
commit message. For starters, you aren't immediately rewarded for doing
it: writing a good commit message doesn't really improve much in the short
term (unless someone <em>yells</em> at you for not doing it). This is a generic
problem applicable to all organizations and tools. This is a problem that
culture must ultimately rectify. But our tools shouldn't reinforce the
disposition towards laziness: they should reward best practices.</p>
<p>I don't believe Bugzilla and our interactions with it do an adequate job
rewarding good commit message writing. Chances are your mechanism for posting
reviews to Bugzilla or posting the publishing of a commit to Bugzilla
(pasting the URL in the simple case) brings up a text box for you to type
<em>review notes</em>, a patch description, or extra context for the landing. These
<em>should</em> be going in the commit message, as they are the type of high-level
context and summarizations of choices or actions that people crave when
discerning the history of a repository. But because that text box is there,
taunting you with its presence, we write content there instead of in the
commit message. Even where tools like bzexport exist to upload patches
to Bugzilla, potentially nipping this practice in the bug, it still engages
in frustrating behavior like reposting the same long commit message on
every patch upload, producing unwanted bug spam. Even a tool that is
pretty sensibly designed has an implementation detail that undermines a
good practice.</p>
<h2>Machine Processing of Patches is Difficult</h2>
<p>I have a challenge for you: identify all patches currently under
consideration for incorporation in the Firefox source tree, run static
analysis on them, and tell me if they meet our code style policies.</p>
<p>This should be a solved problem and deployed system at Mozilla. It
isn't. Part of the problem is because we're using Bugzilla for
conducting review and doing patch management. That may sound
counter-intuitive at first: Bugzilla is a centralized service - surely we
can poll it to discover patches and then do stuff with those patches.
We can. In theory. Things break down very quickly if you try this.</p>
<p>We are uploading patch files to Bugzilla. Patch files are
representations of commits that live outside a repository. In order to
get the full context - the result of the patch file - you need all the
content leading up to that patch file - the repository data. When a
naked patch file is uploaded to Bugzilla, you don't always have this
context.</p>
<p>For starters, you don't know with certainly which repository
the patch belongs to because that isn't part of the standard patch
format produced by Mercurial or Git. There are patches for various
repositories floating around in Bugzilla. So now you need a way to
identify which repository a patch belongs to. It is a solvable problem
(aggregate data for all repositories and match patches based on file
paths, referenced commits, etc), albeit one Mozilla has not yet solved
(but should).</p>
<p>Assuming you can identify the repository a patch belongs to, you need to
know the parent commit so you can apply this patch. Some patches list
their parent commits. Others do not. Even those that do may lie about
it. Patches in MQ don't update their parent field when they are <em>pushed</em>,
only after they are <em>refreshed</em>. You could be testing and uploading a
patch with a different parent commit than what's listed in the patch
file! Even if you do identify the parent commit, this commit could
belong to another patch under consideration that's also on Bugzilla! So
now you need to assemble a directed graph with all the patches known
from Bugzilla applied. Hopefully they all fit in nicely.</p>
<p>Of course, some patches don't have any metadata at all: they are just
naked diffs or are malformed commits produced by tools that e.g. attempt
to convert Git commits to Mercurial commits (Git users: you should be
using hg-git to produce proper Mercurial commits for Firefox patches).</p>
<p>Because Bugzilla is talking in terms of patch files, we often lose
much of the context needed to build nice tools, preventing numerous
potential workflow optimizations through automation. There are many
things machines could be doing for us (such as looking for coding style
violations). Instead, humans are doing this work and costing Mozilla a
lot of time and lost developer productivity in the process. (A human
costs ~$100/hr. A machine on EC2 is pennies per hour and should do the
job with lower latency. In other words, you can operate over 300
machines 24 hours a day for what you may an engineer to work an 8 hour
shift.)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have outlined a few of the side-effects of using Bugzilla as part of
our day-to-day development, review, and landing of changes to Firefox.</p>
<p>There are several takeways.</p>
<p>First, one cannot argue the fact that Firefox development is bug(zilla)
centric. Nearly every important milestone in the lifecycle of a patch
involves Bugzilla in some way. This has its benefits and drawbacks. This
article has identified many of the drawbacks. But before you start
crying to expunge Bugzilla from the loop completely, consider the
benefits, such as a place anyone can go to to add metadata or comments
on something. That's huge. There is a larger discussion to be had here.
But I don't want to be inviting it quite yet.</p>
<p>A common thread between many of the points above is Bugzilla's
unstructured and generic handling of code and metadata attached to it
(patches, review comments, and landing information). Patches are
attachments, which can be anything under the sun. Review comments are
plain text comments with simple author, date, and tag metadata. Landings
are also communicated by plain text review comments (at least
initially - keywords and flags are used in some scenarios).</p>
<p>By being a generic tool, Bugzilla throws away a lot of the rich metadata
that we produce. That data is still technically there in many scenarios.
But it becomes extremely difficult if not practically impossible for
both humans and machines to access efficiently. We lose important
context and feedback by <em>normalizing all this data to Bugzilla</em>. This
data loss creates overhead and technical debt. It slows Mozilla down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the solutions to these problems and shortcomings are
conceptually simple (and generally applicable): preserve rich context. In
the context of patch distribution, push commits to a repository and tell
someone to pull those commits. In the context of code review, create
sub-reviews for different commits and allow tracking and easy-to-follow
(likely threaded) discussions on found issues. Design workflow to be code
first, not tool or bug first. Optimize workflows to minimize people time.
Lean heavily on machines to do grunt work. Integrate issue tracking and
code review, but not too tightly (loosely coupled, highly cohesive). Let
different tools specialize in the handling of different forms of data:
let code review handle code review. Let Bugzilla handle issue tracking.
Let a landing tool handle tracking the state of landings. Use middleware
to make them appear as one logical service if they aren't designed to be
one from the start (such as is Mozilla's case with Bugzilla).</p>
<p>Another solution that's generally applicable is to refine and optimize
the whole process to land a finished commit. Your product is based on
software. So anything that adds overhead or loss of quality in the
process of developing that software is fundamentally a product problem
and should be treated as such. Any time and brain cycles lost to
development friction or bugs that arise from things like inadequate
code reviews tools degrade the quality of your product and take away
from the user experience. This should be plain to see. Attaching a
cost to this to convince the business-minded folks that it is worth
addressing is a harder matter. I find management with empathy and shared
understanding of what amazing tools can do helps a lot.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the solution in one sentence, it would be: <em>invest in
tools and developer happiness.</em></p>
<p>I hope to soon publish a post on how Mozilla's new code review tool
addresses many of the workflow deficiencies present today. Stay tuned.</p>
