  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As of today, ~15.6% of commits landing in Firefox in July have gone
through <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> or have been produced
on machines that have used MozReview. This is still a small percentage
of overall commits. But, signs are that the percentage is going up. Last
month, about half as many commits exhibited the same signature. It's
only July 16 and we've already passed the total from June.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the differences between commits that have
gone through MozReview versus the rest. When you look at the diff
statistics (a quick proxy of change size), we find that MozReview
commits tend to be smaller. The median <em>adds</em> as reported by diff stat
(basically lines that were changed) is 12 for MozReview versus 17
elsewhere. The average is 58 for MozReview versus 100 elsewhere. For
number of files modified, MozReview averages 2.59 versus elsewhere's
2.71. (These numbers exclude some specific large commits that appeared to
be bulk imports of external projects and drove up the non-MozReview
figures.)</p>
<p>It's entirely possible the root cause behind the discrepancy is a
side-effect of the population of MozReview users: perhaps MozReview
users just write smaller commits. However, I'd like to think it's because
MozReview makes it easier to manage multiple commits and people are taking
advantage of that (this is an explicit design goal of MozReview). Whatever
the root cause, I'm glad diffs are smaller.
As I've <a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written about before</a>,
smaller commits are easier to review and land, thus enabling projects to
move faster.</p>
<p>I have a quarterly goal to remove the requirement for a Mozilla LDAP
account to push to MozReview. That will allow first time contributors to
use MozReview. This will be a huge win, as we can do much more magic in
the MozReview world than we can from vanilla Bugzilla (automatic bug
filing, automatic reviewer assignment, etc). Unofficially, I'd like to
have more than 50% of Firefox commits go through MozReview by the end of
the year.</p>

  <p>A month ago, I <a href="/blog/2015/05/29/faster-cloning-from-hg.mozilla.org-with-server-provided-bundles/">blogged about faster cloning from hg.mozilla.org using
bundle files</a>.
But deploying the feature on the servers was only the tip of the
iceberg.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Firefox release automation rolled out the
<em>bundleclone</em> extension to their Linux and OS X machines. Essentially,
clones are bootstrapped from Amazon S3 automatically once this extension
is installed.</p>
<p>In just a few days of deployment, we've already seen a drastic shift in
traffic. On UTC day 2015-07-07, S3 served 1,563,014,396,236 bytes of
repository data! The hg.mozilla.org servers themselves served a total of
1,976,057,201,583 bytes.</p>
<p>But we're not done. The <em>bundleclone</em> extension
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1181597">isn't yet deployed on Windows</a>. Nor is it always used on TaskCluster. In addition, there are
still some high-use repositories that don't have bundles being
generated. Yesterday, I crunched the data and
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1181373">enabled bundles on more repositories</a>. It's too early to have conclusive data, but this should
move an additional several hundred gigabytes of traffic to S3.</p>
<p>At Whistler, I said that reducing traffic on hg.mozilla.org by 90% is
within the realm of possibility. Between a partial rollout of S3
clone offload that is already serving 44% of traffic and a
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-July/071777.html">feature I'm working on in core Mercurial to enable auto sharing of repository data</a>,
I'd say we're well on track.</p>

  <p>A lot of people contributed some really great feedback about MozReview
at Whistler. One of the most frequent requests was for the ability to
publish submitted review requests without having to open a browser.
I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday, this feature is implemented!
If reviewers have been assigned to all your review requests, Mercurial
will now prompt you to publish the review requests during <em>hg push</em>.
It should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we also introduced more advanced feature
negotiation into the handshake between client and server. This means
we now have a mechanism for detecting out-of-date client installations.
This will enable us to more aggressively drop backwards compatibility
(making server-side development easier) while simultaneously ensuring
that more people are running modern and hopefully better versions of the
client code. This should translate to moving faster and a better
experience for everyone.</p>

  <p>Just a few minutes ago, I deployed some updates to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to display more
metadata on changeset pages. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/4b69a62d1905">4b69a62d1905</a>,
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc4023d54436">dc4023d54436</a>,
and <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b617a57d6bf1">b617a57d6bf1</a>
for examples of what's shown.</p>
<p>We currently display:</p>
<ul>
<li>More detailed pushlog info. (Before you had to load another page to
  see things like the date of the push.)</li>
<li>The list of reviewers, each being a link that searches for other
  changesets they've reviewed.</li>
<li>A concise list of bugs referenced in the commit message.</li>
<li>Links to changesets that were backed out by this changeset.</li>
<li>On changesets that were backed out, we <em>may</em> also display a message
  that the changeset was backed out.</li>
<li>For Firefox repos, we also display the application <em>milestone</em>. This
  is the Gecko/app version recorded in the <em>config/milestone.txt</em> file
  in that changeset. The value can be used to quickly answer the
  question <em>What versions of Firefox have this changeset.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice any issues or have requests for new features, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>.</p>
<p>This work is built on top of a feature I added to Mercurial 3.4 to make
it easier to inject extra data into Mercurial's web templates. We just
deployed Mercurial 3.4.1 to hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It's worth noting
that this deployment happened in the middle of the day with no
user-perceived downtime. This is a far cry from where we were a year
ago, when any server change required a maintenance window. We've
invested a lot of work into a test suite for this service so we can
continuously deploy without fear of breaking things. Moving fast feels
so good.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>This was a busy week for MozReview! There are a number of changes people
need to be aware of.</p>
<h2>Support for Specifying Reviewers via Commit Messages</h2>
<p>MozReview will now parse <strong>r?gps</strong> syntax out of commit messages to
set reviewers for pushed commits.</p>
<p><a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/review-requests.html#specifying-reviewers-in-commit-messages">Read the docs</a>
for more information, including why we are preferring <strong>r?</strong> to <strong>r=</strong>.</p>
<p>Since it landed, a number of workflow concerns have been reported.
See the bug tree for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1142251">bug 1142251</a>
before filing a bug to help avoid duplicates.</p>
<p>Thank Dan Minor for the feature!</p>
<h2>Review Attachment/Flag Per Commit</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of MozReview, there was one Bugzilla attachment /
review flag per commit series. This has changed to one attachment /
review flag per commit.</p>
<p>Before, you needed to grant <em>Ship It</em> on the parent/root review request
in order to r+ the MozReview review request. Now, you grant <em>Ship It</em>
on individual commits and these turn into individual r+ on Bugzilla.
To reinforce that reviewing the parent/root review request doesn't do
anything meaningful any more, the <em>Ship It</em> button and checkbox have been
removed from the parent/root review request.</p>
<p>The new model more closely maps to how code review in Bugzilla has
worked at Mozilla for ages. And, it is a superior workflow for
future workflows we're trying to enable.</p>
<p>We tried to run a one-time migration script to convert existing
parent/root attachments/review flags to per-commit attachments/flags.
However, there were issues. We will attempt again sometime next week.
In the interim, <strong>in-flight review requests may enter an inconsistent
state if they are updated</strong>. If a new push is performed, the old
parent/root attachment/review flag may linger and per-commit
attachments/flags will be created. This could be confusing. The
workaround is to manually clear the r? flag from the parent/root
attachment or wait for the migration script to run in a few days.</p>
<p>Mark Côté put in a lot of hard work to make this change happen.</p>
<h2>r? Flags Cleared After Review</h2>
<p>Before, submitting a review without granting <em>Ship It</em> wouldn't do
anything to the r? flag: the r? flag would linger.</p>
<p>Now, submitting review without granting <em>Ship It</em> will clear the r?
flag. We think the new default is better for the majority of users.
However, we recognize it isn't always wanted. There is a bug open to
provide a checkbox to keep the r? flag present.</p>
<h2>Metadata Added to Changesets</h2>
<p>If you update to the tip of the version-control-tools repository
(you should do this every week or so to stay fresh - use <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em> to do this automatically), metadata will automatically
be added to commits when working with MozReview-enabled repositories.</p>
<p>Specifically, we insert a hidden, unique, random ID into every changeset.
This ID can be used to map commits to each other. We don't use this ID
yet. But we have plans.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this change is that you can no longer push to MozReview
if you have uncommitted local changes. If this is annoying, use <em>hg
shelve</em> and <em>hg unshelve</em> to create and undo temporary commits. If this
is too annoying, complain by filing a bug and we can look into doing
this automatically as part of pushing.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>We're actively working on more workflow enhancements to make MozReview
an even more compelling experience.</p>
<p>I'm building a web service to query file metadata from moz.build files.
This will allow MozReview to automatically file bugs in proper
components based on what files changed. Once code reviewer metadata
is added to moz.build files, it will enable us to assign reviewers
automatically as well. The end goal here is to lower the number of steps
needed to turn changed code into a landing. This will be useful when we
turn GitHub pull requests into MozReview review requests (random GitHub
contributors shouldn't need to know who to flag for review, nor should
they be required to file a bug if they write some code). Oh year, we're
working on integrating GitHub pull requests.</p>
<p>Another area of focus is better commit tracking and partially landed
series. I have preliminary patches for automatically adding review URL
annotations to commit messages. This will enable people to easily go
from commit (message) to MozReview, without having to jump through
Bugzilla. This also enables better commit tracking. If you e.g.
perform complicated history rewriting, the review URL annotation will
enable the MozReview server to better map previously-submitted commits
to existing review requests. Partially landed series will enable
commits to land as soon as they are reviewed, without having to wait
on the entire series. It's my strong belief that if a commit is granted
review, it should land as soon as possible. This helps prevent bit rot
of ready-to-land commits. Landings also make people feel better because
you feel like you've accomplished something. Positive feedback loops are
good.</p>
<p>Major work is also being done to overhaul the web UI. The commit series
view (which is currently populated via XHR) will soon be generated on
the server and served as part of the page. This should make pages load a
bit faster. And, things should be prettier as well.</p>
<p>And, of course, work is being invested into Autoland. Support for
submitting pushes to Try landed a few weeks ago. Having Autoland
actually land reviewed commits is on the radar.</p>
<p>Exciting times are ahead. Please continue to provide feedback. If you
see something, <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hacking-mozreview.html#filing-bugs">say something</a>.</p>
