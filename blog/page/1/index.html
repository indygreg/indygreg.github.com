<a href='/blog/category/python'>Python</a>, <a href='/blog/category/pyoxidizer'>PyOxidizer</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'm pleased to announce the initial release of
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyoxy.html">PyOxy</a>.
Binaries are <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/pyoxy%2F0.1.0">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>(Yes, I used my <a href="/blog/2022/04/25/expanding-apple-ecosystem-access-with-open-source,-multi-platform-code-signing/">pure Rust Apple code signing implementation</a>
to remotely sign the macOS binaries from GitHub Actions using a YubiKey
plugged into my Windows desktop: that experience still feels magical
to me.)</p>
<p>PyOxy is all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An executable program used for running Python interpreters.</li>
<li>A single file and highly portable (C)Python distribution.</li>
<li>An alternative <code>python</code> driver providing more control over the
  interpreter than what <code>python</code> itself provides.</li>
<li>A way to make some of PyOxidizer's technology more broadly available without
  using PyOxidizer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the following sections for more details.</p>
<h2><code>pyoxy</code> Acts Like <code>python</code></h2>
<p>The <code>pyoxy</code> executable has a <code>run-python</code> sub-command that will essentially
do what <code>python</code> would do::</p>
<pre><code>$ pyoxy run-python
Python 3.9.12 (main, May  3 2022, 03:29:54)
[Clang 14.0.3 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A Python REPL. That's familiar!</p>
<p>You can even pass <code>python</code> arguments to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ pyoxy run-python -- -c 'print("hello, world")'
hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>When a <code>pyoxy</code> executable is renamed to any filename beginning with <code>python</code>,
it implicitly behaves like <code>pyoxy run-python --</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ mv pyoxy python3.9
$ ls -al python3.9
-rwxrwxr-x  1 gps gps 120868856 May 10  2022 python3.9

$ ./python3.9
Python 3.9.12 (main, May  3 2022, 03:29:54)
[Clang 14.0.3 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Single File Python Distributions</h2>
<p>The official <code>pyoxy</code> executables are built with PyOxidizer and leverage the
Python distributions provided by my
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/">python-build-standalone</a>
project. On Linux and macOS, a fully featured Python interpreter and its library
dependencies are statically linked into <code>pyoxy</code>. The <code>pyoxy</code> executable also embeds
a copy of the Python standard library and imports it from memory using the
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oxidized_importer.html">oxidized_importer</a>
Python extension module.</p>
<p>What this all means is that the official <code>pyoxy</code> executables can function as
single file CPython distributions! Just download a <code>pyoxy</code> executable, rename it
to <code>python</code>, <code>python3</code>, <code>python3.9</code>, etc and it should behave just like a normal
<code>python</code> would!</p>
<p>Your Python installation has never been so simple. And fast: <code>pyoxy</code> should be
a few milliseconds faster to initialize a Python interpreter mostly because of
<code>oxidized_importer</code> and it avoiding filesystem overhead to look for and load
<code>.py[c]</code> files.</p>
<h2>Low-Level Control Over the Python Interpreter with YAML</h2>
<p>The <code>pyoxy run-yaml</code> command is takes the path to a YAML file defining the
embedded Python interpreter configuration and then launches that Python
interpreter in-process:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &gt; hello_world.yaml &lt;&lt;EOF
---
allocator_debug: true
interpreter_config:
  run_command: 'print("hello, world")'
...
EOF

$ pyoxy run-yaml hello_world.yaml
hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood, PyOxy uses the
<a href="https://docs.rs/pyembed/0.20.0/pyembed/">pyembed</a> Rust crate to manage embedded
Python interpreters. The YAML document that PyOxy uses is simply deserialized
into a
<a href="https://docs.rs/pyembed/0.20.0/pyembed/struct.OxidizedPythonInterpreterConfig.html">pyembed::OxidizedPythonInterpreterConfig</a>
Rust struct, which <code>pyembed</code> uses to spawn a Python interpreter. This Rust struct
offers near complete control over how the embedded Python interpreter behaves: it
even allows you to tweak settings that are impossible to change from environment
variables or <code>python</code> command arguments! (Beware: this power means you can
easily cause the interpreter to crash if you feed it a bad configuration!)</p>
<h2>YAML Based Python Applications</h2>
<p><code>pyoxy run-yaml</code> ignores all file content before the YAML <code>---</code> start document
delimiter. This means that on UNIX-like platforms
you can create <em>executable YAML</em> files defining your Python application. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p myapp
$ cat &gt; myapp/__main__.py &lt;&lt; EOF
print("hello from myapp")
EOF

$ cat &gt; say_hello &lt;&lt;"EOF"
#!/bin/sh
"exec" "`dirname $0`/pyoxy" run-yaml "$0" -- "$@"
---
interpreter_config:
  run_module: 'myapp'
  module_search_paths: ["$ORIGIN"]
...
EOF

$ chmod +x say_hello

$ ./hello_world
hello from myapp
</code></pre>
<p>This means that to <em>distribute</em> a Python application, you can drop a copy
of <code>pyoxy</code> in a directory then define an executable YAML file masquerading
as a shell script and you can run Python code with as little as two files!</p>
<h2>The Future of PyOxy</h2>
<p>PyOxy is very young. I hacked it together on a weekend in September 2021.
I wanted to shore up some functionality before releasing it then. But I
got perpetually sidetracked and never did the work. I figured it would be
better to make a smaller splash with a lesser-baked product now than wait
even longer. Anyway...</p>
<p>As part of building
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyoxidizer.html">PyOxidizer</a> I've
built some peripheral technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone and highly distributable Python builds via the
  <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
  project.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.rs/pyembed/0.20.0/pyembed/">pyembed</a> Rust crate for managing
  an embedded Python interpreter.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/oxidized_importer.html">oxidized_importer</a>
  Python package/extension for importing modules from memory, among other
  things.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oxidized_importer_packed_resources.html">Python packed resources</a>
  data format for representing a collection of Python modules and resource
  files for efficient loading (by <code>oxidized_importer</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I conceived PyOxy as a vehicle to enable people to leverage PyOxidizer's
technology without imposing PyOxidizer onto them. I feel that PyOxidizer's
broader technology is generally useful and too valuable to be gated behind
using PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>PyOxy is only officially released for Linux and macOS for the moment.
It definitely builds on Windows. However, I want to improve the single file
executable experience before officially releasing PyOxy on Windows. This
requires an extensive overhaul to <code>oxidized_importer</code> and the way it
serializes Python resources to be loaded from memory.</p>
<p>I'd like to add a sub-command to produce a
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oxidized_importer_packed_resources.html">Python packed resources</a>
payload. With this, you could bundle/distribute a Python application as
<code>pyoxy</code> plus a file containing your application's packed resources alongside
YAML configuring the Python interpreter. Think of this as a more modern and
faster version of the venerable <code>zipapp</code> approach. This would enable PyOxy to
satisfy packaging scenarios provided by tools like Shiv, PEX, and XAR.
However, unlike Shiv and PEX, <code>pyoxy</code> also provides an embedded Python
interpreter, so applications are much more portable since there isn't
reliance on the host machine having a Python interpreter installed.</p>
<p>I'm really keen to see how others want to use <code>pyoxy</code>.</p>
<p>The YAML based control over the Python interpreter could be super useful for
testing, benchmarking, and general Python interpreter configuration
experimentation. It essentially opens the door to things previously only
possible if you wrote code interfacing with Python's C APIs.</p>
<p>I can also envision tools that hide the existence of Python wanting to
leverage the single file Python distribution property of <code>pyoxy</code>. For
example, tools like Ansible could copy <code>pyoxy</code> to a remote machine to provide
a well-defined Python execution environment without having to rely on what
packages are installed. Or <code>pyoxy</code> could be copied into a container or
other sandboxed/minimal environment to provide a Python interpreter.</p>

  <small>April 25, 2022 at 08:00 AM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/rust'>Rust</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A little over one year ago, I
<a href="/blog/2021/04/14/pure-rust-implementation-of-apple-code-signing/">announced a project to implement Apple code signing in pure Rust</a>.
There have been quite a number of developments since that post and I thought
a blog post was in order. So here we are!</p>
<p>But first, some background on why we're here.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>(Skip this section if you just want to get to the technical bits.)</p>
<p>Apple runs some of the largest and most profitable software application
ecosystems in existence. Gaining access to these ecosystems has traditionally
required the use of macOS and membership in the Apple Developer Program.</p>
<p>For the most part this makes sense: if you want to develop applications for
Apple operating systems you will likely utilize Apple's operating systems
and Apple's official tooling for development and distribution. Sticking to
the paved road is a good default!</p>
<p>But many people want more... flexibility. Open source developers, for example,
often want to distribute cross-platform applications with minimal effort.
There are entire programming language ecosystems where the operating system
you are running on is abstracted away as an implementation detail for many
applications. <strong>By creating a de facto requirement that macOS, iOS, etc
development require the direct access to macOS and (often above market priced)
Apple hardware, the distribution requirements imposed by Apple's software
ecosystems are effectively exclusionary and prevent interested parties
from contributing to the ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>One of the aspects of software distribution on Apple platforms that trips
a lot of people up is code signing and notarization. Essentially, you need
to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embed a cryptographic signature in applications that effectively attests
   to its authenticity from an Apple Developer Program associated account.
   (This is signing.)</li>
<li>Upload your application to Apple so they can inspect it, verify it meets
   requirements, likely store a copy of it. Apple then issues their own
   cryptographic signature called a <em>notarization ticket</em> which then needs
   to be <em>stapled</em>/attached to the application being distributed so Apple
   operating systems can trust it. (This is notarization.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Historically, these steps required Apple proprietary software run exclusively
from macOS. This means that even if you are in a software ecosystem like Rust,
Go, or the web platform where you can cross-compile apps without direct access
to macOS (testing is obviously a different story), you would still need macOS
somewhere if you wanted to sign and notarize your application. And signing and
notarization is effectively required on macOS due to default security settings.
On mobile platforms like iOS, it is impossible to distribute applications that
aren't signed and notarized unless you are running a jailbreaked device.</p>
<p>A lot of people (myself included) have grumbled at these requirements.
Why should I be forced to involve an Apple machine as part of my software
release process if I don't need macOS to build my application? Why do I have
to go through a convoluted dance to sign and notarize my application at
release time - can't it be more streamlined?</p>
<p>When I looked at this space last year, I saw some obvious inefficiencies
and room to improve. So as I said then, I <em>foolishly</em> set out to reimplement
Apple code signing so developers would have more flexibility and opportunity
for distributing applications to Apple's ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>The ultimate goal of this work is to expand Apple ecosystem access to more
developers.</strong> A year later, I believe I'm delivering a product capable of
doing this.</p>
<h2>One Year Later</h2>
<p><strong>Foremost, I'm excited to announce release of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign/0.14.0">rcodesign 0.14.0</a>.
This is the first time I'm publishing pre-built binaries (Linux, Windows, and macOS)
of <code>rcodesign</code>. This reflects my confidence in the relative maturity of the
software.</strong></p>
<p>In case you are wondering, yes, the macOS <code>rcodesign</code> executable is self-signed:
it was signed by a GitHub Actions Linux runner using a code signing certificate
exclusive to a YubiKey. That YubiKey was plugged into a Windows 11 desktop next to
my desk. The <code>rcodesign</code> executable was not copied between machines as part of the
signing operation. Read on to learn about the sorcery that made this possible.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/tree/main/apple-codesign">apple-codesign</a>
project / Rust crate in the last year! Just look at the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/main/apple-codesign/CHANGELOG.rst">changelog</a>!</p>
<p>The project was renamed from <code>tugger-apple-codesign</code>.</p>
<p>(If you installed via <code>cargo install</code>, you'll need to
<code>cargo install --force apple-codesign</code> to force Cargo to overwrite the <code>rcodesign</code>
executable with one from a different crate.)</p>
<p>The <code>rcodesign</code> CLI executable is still there and more powerful than ever.
You can still sign Apple applications from Linux, Windows, macOS, and any other
platform you can get the Rust program to compile on.</p>
<p>There is now <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign.html">Sphinx documentation for the project</a>.
This is published on readthedocs.io alongside PyOxidizer's documentation (because
I'm using a monorepo). There's some general documentation in there, such as a
guide on how to
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_custom_assessment_policies.html">selectively bypass Gatekeeper</a>
by deploying your own alternative code signing PKI to parallel Apple's. (This
seems like something many companies would want but for whatever reason I'm
not aware of anyone doing this - possibly because very few people understand
how these systems work.)</p>
<p>There are bug fixes galore. When I look back at the state of <code>rcodesign</code>
when I first blogged about it, I think of how naive I was. There were a myriad
of applications that wouldn't pass notarization because of a long tail of bugs.
There are still known issues. But <strong>I believe many applications will
successfully sign and notarize now.</strong> I consider failures novel and worthy of
bug reports - so please <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">report them</a>!</p>
<p>Read on to learn about some of the notable improvements in the past year (many
of them occurring in the last two months).</p>
<h2>Support for Signing Bundles, DMGs, and <code>.pkg</code> Installers</h2>
<p>When I announced this project last year, only Mach-O binaries and trivially
simple <code>.app</code> bundles were signable. And even then there were a ton of subtle
issues.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign sign</code> can now sign more complex bundles, including many nested
bundles. There are reports of iOS app bundles signing correctly! (However, we
don't yet have good end-user documentation for signing iOS apps. I will gladly
accept PRs to improve the documentation!)</p>
<p>The tool also gained support for signing <code>.dmg</code> disk image files and <code>.pkg</code>
flat package installers.</p>
<p>Known limitations with signing are now
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_quirks.html">documented</a>
in the Sphinx docs.</p>
<p><strong>I believe <code>rcodesign</code> now supports signing all the major file formats used
for Apple software distribution.</strong> If you find something that doesn't sign
and it isn't documented as a known issue with an existing GitHub issue tracking
it, please report it!</p>
<h2>Support for Notarization on Linux, Windows, and macOS</h2>
<p>Apple publishes a Java tool named
<a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/">Transporter</a> that enables you
to upload artifacts to Apple for notarization. They make this tool available for
Linux, Windows, and of course macOS.</p>
<p>While this tool isn't open source (as far as I know), usage of this tool enables
you to notarize from Linux and Windows while still using Apple's official
tooling for communicating with their servers.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign</code> now has support for invoking Transporter and uploading artifacts
to Apple for notarization. We now support notarizing bundles, <code>.dmg</code> disk
images, and <code>.pkg</code> flat installer packages. I've successfully notarized all
of these application types from Linux.</p>
<p>(I'm capable of implementing
an alternative uploader in pure Rust but without assurances that Apple won't
bring down the ban hammer for violating terms of use, this is a bridge I'm
not yet willing to cross. The requirement to use Transporter is literally the
only thing standing in the way of making <code>rcodesign</code> an all-in-one single
file executable tool for signing and notarizing Apple software and I <strong>really</strong>
wish I could deliver this user experience win without reprisal.)</p>
<p><strong>With support for both signing and notarizing all application types, it is
now possible to release Apple software without macOS involved in your release
process.</strong></p>
<h2>YubiKey Integration</h2>
<p>I try to use my YubiKeys as much as possible because a secret or private key
stored on a YubiKey is likely more secure than a secret or private key sitting
around on a filesystem somewhere. If you hack my machine, you can likely
gain access to my private keys. But you will need physical access to my
YubiKey and to compel or coerce me into unlocking it in order to gain access
to its private keys.</p>
<p><strong><code>rcodesign</code> now has support for using YubiKeys for signing operations.</strong></p>
<p>This does require an off-by-default <code>smartcard</code> Cargo feature. So if
building manually you'll need to e.g.
<code>cargo install --features smartcard apple-codesign</code>.</p>
<p>The YubiKey integration comes courtesy of the amazing
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/yubikey">yubikey</a> Rust crate. This crate will speak
directly to the smartcard APIs built into macOS and Windows. So if you have an
<code>rcodesign</code> build with YubiKey support enabled, YubiKeys should
<em>just work</em>. Try it by plugging in your YubiKey and running
<code>rcodesign smartcard-scan</code>.</p>
<p>YubiKey integration has its
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_smartcard.html">own documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I even implemented some commands to make it easy to manage the code signing
certificates on your YubiKey. For example, you can run
<code>rcodesign smartcard-generate-key --smartcard-slot 9c</code> to generate a new private
key directly on the device and then
<code>rcodesign generate-certificate-signing-request --smartcard-slot 9c --csr-pem-path csr.pem</code>
to export that certificate to a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which you can
exchange for an Applie-issued signing certificate at developer.apple.com. <strong>This
means you can easily create code signing certificates whose private key was
generated directly on the hardware device and can never be exported.</strong>
Generating keys this way is widely considered to be more secure than storing
keys in software vaults, like Apple's Keychains.</p>
<h2>Remote Code Signing</h2>
<p>The feature I'm most excited about is what I'm calling
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing.html">remote code signing</a>.</p>
<p>Remote code signing allows you to delegate the low-level cryptographic signature
operations in code signing to a separate machine.</p>
<p>It's probably easiest to just demonstrate what it can do.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier today I signed a macOS universal Mach-O executable from a GitHub-hosted
Linux GitHub Actions runner using a YubiKey physically attached to the
Windows 11 machine next to my desk at home. The signed application was not
copied between machines.</strong></p>
<p>Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>I have a GitHub Actions workflow that calls <code>rcodesign sign --remote-signer</code>.
I manually triggered that workflow and started watching the near real time
job output with my browser. Here's a screenshot of the job logs:</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions initiating remote code signing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_sjs_join.png" /></p>
<p><code>rcodesign sign --remote-signer</code> prints out some instructions (including a
wall of base64 encoded data) for what to do next. Importantly, it requests that
someone else run <code>rcodesign remote-sign</code> to continue the signing process.</p>
<p>And here's a screenshot of me doing that from the Windows terminal:</p>
<p><img alt="Windows terminal output from running remote-sign command" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_signer_output.png" /></p>
<p>This log shows us connecting and authenticating with the YubiKey along
with some status updates regarding speaking to a remote server.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a screenshot of the GitHub Actions job output after
I ran that command on my Windows machine:</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions initiating machine output" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_initiator_output.png" /></p>
<p><em>Remote signing</em> enabled me to sign a macOS application from a GitHub Actions
runner operated by GitHub while using a code signing certificate securely
stored on my YubiKey plugged into a Windows machine hundreds of kilometers away
from the GitHub Actions runner. Magic, right?</p>
<p>What's happening here is the 2 <code>rcodesign</code> processes are communicating
with each other via websockets bridged by a central relay server.
(I operate a
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html#default-remote-code-signing-server">default server free of charge</a>.
The server is open source and a Terraform module is available if you want
to run your own server with hopefully just a few minutes of effort.)
When the initiating machine wants to create a signature, it sends a
message back to the <em>signer</em> requesting a cryptographic signature. The
signature is then sent back to the initiator, who incorporates it.</p>
<p><strong>I designed this feature with automated releases from CI systems (like
GitHub Actions) in mind. I wanted a way where I could streamline the
code signing and release process of applications without having to give
a low trust machine in CI ~unlimited access to my private signing key.
But the more I thought about it the more I realized there are likely
many other scenarios where this could be useful. Have you ever emailed
or Dropboxed an application for someone else to sign because you don't
have an Apple issued code signing certificate? Now you have an alternative
solution that doesn't require copying files around!</strong> As long as you
can see the log output from the initiating machine or have that output
communicated to you (say over a chat application or email), you can
remotely sign files on another machine!</p>
<h3>An Aside on the Security of Remote Signing</h3>
<p>At this point, I'm confident the more security conscious among you have
been grimacing for a few paragraphs now. Websockets through a central
server operated by a 3rd party?! Giving remote machines access to perform
code signing against arbitrary content?! Your fears and skepticism are
100% justified: I'd be thinking the same thing!</p>
<p>I fully recognize that a service that facilitates remote code signing makes
for a very lucrative attack target! If abused, it could be used to coerce
parties with valid code signing certificates to sign unwanted code, like
malware. There are many, many, many <em>wrong</em> ways to implement such a feature.
I pondered for hours about the threat modeling and how to make this feature
as secure as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html">Remote Code Signing Design and Security Considerations</a>
captures some of my high level design goals and security assessments.
And <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_protocol.html">Remote Code Signing Protocol</a>
goes into detail about the communications protocol, including the
crypto (actual cryptography, not the fad) involved. The key takeaways are
the protocol and server are designed such that a malicious server or
man-in-the-middle can not forge signature requests. Signing sessions expire
after a few minutes and 3rd parties (or the server) can't inject malicious
messages that would result in unwanted signatures. There is an initial
handshake to derive a session ephemeral shared encryption key and from
there symmetric encryption keys are used so all meaningful messages between
peers are end-to-end encrypted. About the worst a malicious server could do
is conduct a denial of service. This is by design.</p>
<p>As I argue in <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html#security-analysis-in-the-bigger-picture">Security Analysis in the Bigger Picture</a>,
I believe that my implementation of <em>remote signing</em> is <strong>more</strong> secure than
many common practices because common practices today entail making copies
of private keys and giving low trust machines (like CI workers) access to
private keys. Or files are copied around without cryptographic chain-of-custody
to prove against tampering. Yes, <em>remote signing</em> introduces a vector for remote
access to <em>use</em> signing keys. But practiced as I intended, <em>remote signing</em> can
eliminate the need to copy private keys or grant ~unlimited access to them.
From a threat modeling perspective, I think the net restriction in key
access makes <em>remote signing</em> more secure than the private key management
practices by many today.</p>
<p><strong>All that being said, the giant asterisk here is I implemented my own
cryptosystem to achieve end-to-end message security. If there are bugs in
the design or implementation, that cryptosystem could come crashing down,
bringing defenses against message forgery with it.</strong> At that point, a
malicious server or privileged network actor could potentially coerce
someone into signing unwanted software. But this is likely the extent of
the damage: an offline attack against the signing key should not be
possible since signing requires presence and since the private key is
never transmitted over the wire. Even without the end-to-end encryption,
the system is <em>arguably</em> more secure than leaving your private key
lingering around as an easily exfiltrated CI secret (or similar).</p>
<p>(I apologize to every cryptographer I worked with at Mozilla who beat into me
the commandment that <em>thou shall not roll their own crypto</em>: I have sinned
and I feel remorseful.) </p>
<p>Cryptography is hard. And I'm sure I made plenty of subtle mistakes.
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/552">Issue #552</a> tracks
getting an audit of this protocol and code performed. And the aforementioned
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_protocol.html">protocol design docs</a>
call out some of the places where I question decisions I've made.</p>
<p><strong>If you would be interested in doing a security review on this feature,
please get in touch on issue #552 or
<a href="mailto:gregory.szorc@gmail.com">send me an email</a>. If there's one immediate
outcome I'd like from this blog post it would be for some white hat^Hknight
to show up and give me peace of mind about the cryptosystem implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Until then, please assume the end-to-end encryption is completely flawed.</strong>
Consider asking someone with <em>security</em> or <em>cryptographer</em> in their job title
for their opinion on whether this feature is safe for you to use. Hopefully
we'll get a security review done soon and this caveat can go away!</p>
<p>If you do want to use this feature,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing.html">Remote Code Signing</a>
contains some usage documentation, including how to use it with GitHub
Actions. (I could also use some help productionizing a reusable GitHub Action
to make this more turnkey! Although I'm hesitant to do it before I know the
cryptosystem is sound.)</p>
<p>That was a long introduction to <em>remote code signing</em>. But I couldn't
in good faith present the feature without addressing the security aspect.
Hopefully I didn't scare you away! <strong>Traditional / local signing should
have no security concerns</strong> (beyond the willingness to run software written
by somebody you probably don't know, of course).</p>
<h2>Apple Keychain Support</h2>
<p>As of today's 0.14 release we now have early support for signing with code signing
certificates stored in Apple Keychains! If you created your Apple code signing
certificates in Keychain Access or Xcode, this is probably where you code
signing certificates live.</p>
<p>I held off implementing this for the longest time because I didn't perceive
there to be a benefit: if you are on macOS, just use Apple's official tooling.
But with <code>rcodesign</code> gaining support for remote code signing and some other
features that could make it a compelling replacement for Apple tooling on
all platforms, I figured we should provide the feature so we stop discouraging
people to export private keys from Keychains.</p>
<p>This integration is very young and there's still a lot that can be done,
such as automatically using an appropriate signing certificate based on
what you are signing. Please file feature request issues if there's
a must-have feature you are missing!</p>
<h2>Better Debugging of Failures</h2>
<p>Apple's code signing is complex. It is easy for there to be subtle differences
between Apple's tooling and <code>rcodesign</code>.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign</code> now has <code>print-signature-info</code> and <code>diff-signatures</code> commands to
dump and compare YAML metadata pertinent to code signing to make it easier to
compare behavior between code signing implementations and even multiple
signing operations.</p>
<p>The documentation around
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">debugging and reporting bugs</a>
now emphasizes using these tools to help identify bugs.</p>
<h2>A Request For Users and Feedback</h2>
<p>I now believe <code>rcodesign</code> to be generally usable. I've thrown a lot of
random software at it and I feel like most of the big bugs and major missing
features are behind us.</p>
<p>But I also feel it hasn't yet received wide enough attention to have confidence
in that assessment.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to help the development of this tool, the most important
actions you can take are to attempt signing / notarization operations with it
and report your results.</strong></p>
<p>Does <code>rcodesign</code> spark joy? Please leave a comment in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/discussions/556">GitHub discussion for the latest release</a>!</p>
<p>Does <code>rcodesign</code> not work? I would very much appreciate a bug report!
Details on how to file good bugs are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>Have general feedback? UI is confusing? Documentation is insufficient?
Leave a comment in the aforementioned discussion. Or
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/new">create a GitHub issue</a> if
you think it is actionable. I can't fix what I don't know about!</p>
<p>Have private feedback? <a href="mailto:gregory.szorc@gmail.com">Send me an email</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I could write thousands of words about all I learned from hacking on this
project.</p>
<p>I've learned way too much about too many standards and specifications in the
crypto space. RFCs 2986, 3161, 3280, 3281, 3447, 4210, 4519, 5280, 5480,
5652, 5869, 5915, 5958, and 8017 plus probably a few more. How cryptographic
primitives are stored and expressed: ASN.1, OIDs, BER, DER, PEM, SPKI,
PKCS#1, PKCS#8. You can show me the raw parse tree for an ASN.1 data structure
and I can probably tell you what RFC defines it. I'm not proud of this. But
I will say actually knowing what every field in an X.509 certificate does
or the many formats that cryptographic keys are expressed in seems empowering.
Before, I would just search for the <code>openssl</code> incantation to do something.
Now, I know which ASN.1 data structures are involved and how to manipulate
the fields within.</p>
<p>I've learned way too much around minutia around how Apple code signing
actually works. The mechanism is way too complex for something in the security
space. There was at least one high profile Gatekeeper bug in the past year
allowing improperly signed code to run. I suspect there will be more: the
surface area to exploit is just too large.</p>
<p><strong>I think I'm proud of building an open source implementation of Apple's code
signing. To my knowledge nobody else has done this outside of Apple. At least
not to the degree I have.</strong> Then factor in that I was able to do this without
access (or willingness) to look at Apple source code and much of the progress was
achieved by diffing and comparing results with Apple's tooling. Hours of
staring at diffoscope and comparing binary data structures. Hours of trying
to find the magical settings that enabled a SHA-1 or SHA-256 digest to agree.
It was tedious work for sure. I'll likely never see a financial return on
the time equivalent it took me to develop this software. But, I suppose I
can nerd brag that I was able to implement this!</p>
<p><strong>But the real reward for this work will be if it opens up avenues to more
(open source) projects distributing to the Apple ecosystems.</strong> This has
historically been challenging for multiple reasons and many open source
projects have avoided official / proper distribution channels to avoid the
pain (or in some cases because of philosophical disagreements with the premise
of having a walled software garden in the first place). I suspect things
will only get worse, as I feel it is inevitable Apple clamps down on signing
and notarization requirements on macOS due to the rising costs of malware
and ransomware. <strong>So having an alternative, open source, and multi-platform
implementation of Apple code signing seems like something important that
should exist in order to provide opportunities to otherwise excluded
developers. I would be humbled if my work empowers others. And this is
all the reward I need.</strong></p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've frequently wanted to ask random questions about Linux packages and
binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which packages provide a file X?</li>
<li>Which binaries link against a library X?</li>
<li>Which libraries/packages define/export a symbol X?</li>
<li>Which binaries reference an undefined symbol X?</li>
<li>Which features of ELF are in common use?</li>
<li>Which x86 instructions are in a binary?</li>
<li>What are the most common ELF section names and their sizes?</li>
<li>What are the differences between package X in distributions A and B?</li>
<li>Which ELF binaries have the most relocations?</li>
<li>And many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I built
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/tree/main/linux-package-analyzer">Linux Package Analyzer</a>
to facilitate answering questions like this.</p>
<p>Linux Package Analyzer is a Rust crate providing the <code>lpa</code> CLI tool. <code>lpa</code> currently
supports importing Debian and RPM package repositories (the most popular Linux
packaging formats) into a local SQLite database so subsequent analysis can be
efficiently performed offline. In essence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>lpa import-debian-repository</code> or <code>lpa import-rpm-repository</code> and point
   the tool at the base URL of a Linux package repository.</li>
<li>Package indices are fetched.</li>
<li>Discovered <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> files are downloaded.</li>
<li>Installed files within each package archive are inspected.</li>
<li>Binary/ELF files have their executable sections disassembled.</li>
<li>Results are stored in a local SQLite database for subsequent analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>The LPA-built database currently stores the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported packages (name, version, source URL).</li>
<li>Installed files within each package (path, size).</li>
<li>ELF file information (parsed fields from header, number of relocations,
  important metadata from the <code>.dynamic</code> section, etc).</li>
<li>ELF sections (number, type, flags, address, file offset, etc).</li>
<li>Dynamic libraries required by ELF files.</li>
<li>ELF symbols (name, demangled name, type constant, binding, visibility,
  version string, etc).</li>
<li>For x86 architectures, counts of unique instructions in each ELF file and
  counts of instructions referencing specific registers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a command like <code>lpa import-debian-repository --components main,multiverse,restricted,universe
--architectures amd64 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu impish</code>, I can import
the (currently) ~96 GB of package data from 63,720 packages defining Ubuntu 21.10
to a local ~12 GB SQLite database and answer tons of random questions. Interesting
insights yielded so far include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entirety of the package ecosystem for amd64 consists of
  63,720 packages providing 6,704,222 files (168,730 of them ELF binaries)
  comprising 355,700,362,973 bytes in total.</li>
<li>Within the 168,730 ELF binaries are 5,286,210 total sections having
  606,175 distinct names. There are also 116,688,943 symbols
  in symbol tables (debugging info is not included and local symbols not
  imported or exported are often not present in symbol tables) across
  19,085,540 distinct symbol names. The sum of all the unique symbol names
  is 1,263,441,355 bytes and 4,574,688,289 bytes if you count occurrences
  across all symbol tables (this might be an over count due to how ELF string
  tables work).</li>
<li>The longest demangled ELF symbol is 271,800 characters and is defined in
  the file <code>usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmshr.so.2019.2.0.dev0</code> provided by
  the <code>libmshr2019.2</code> package.</li>
<li>The longest non-mangled ELF symbol is 5,321 characters and is defined in
  multiple files/packages, as it is part of a library provided by GCC.</li>
<li>Only 145 packages have files with
  <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC">indirect functions (IFUNCs)</a>.
  If you discard duplicates (mainly from GCC and glibc), you are left with
  ~11 packages. This does not appear to be a popular ELF feature!</li>
<li>With 54,764 references in symbol tables, <code>strlen</code> appears to be the most
  (recognized) widely used libc symbol. It even bests <code>memcpy</code> (52,726) and
  <code>free</code> (42,603).</li>
<li><code>MOV</code> is the most frequent x86 instruction, followed by <code>CALL</code>. (I could
  write an entire blog post about observations about x86 instruction use.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a trove of data in the SQLite database and the <code>lpa</code> commands only
expose a fraction of it. I reckon a lot of interesting tweets, blog posts,
research papers, and more could be derived from the data that <code>lpa</code> assembles.</p>
<p><code>lpa</code> does all of its work in-process using pure Rust. The Debian and RPM
repository interaction is handled via the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/debian-packaging">debian-packaging</a> and
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpm-repository">rpm-repository</a> crates (which I
wrote). ELF file parsing is handled by the (amazing)
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/object">object</a> crate. And x86 disassembling via
the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/iced-x86">iced-x86</a> crate. Many tools similar
to <code>lpa</code> call out to other processes to interface with <code>.deb</code>/.<code>rpm</code> packages,
parse ELF files, disassemble x86, etc. Doing this in pure Rust makes life so
much simpler as all the functionality is self-contained and I don't have to
worry about run-time dependencies for random tools. This means that <code>lpa</code>
should <em>just work</em> from Windows, macOS, and other non-Linux environments.</p>
<p>Linux Package Analyzer is very much in its infancy. And I don't really
have a grand vision for it. (I built it and some of the packaging code it
is built on) in support of some even grander projects I have cooking.) Please
file bugs, feature requests, and pull requests
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">in GitHub</a>. The project is currently
part of the PyOxidizer repo (because I like monorepos). But I may pull it and
other os/packaging/toolchain code into a new monorepo since target audiences
are different.</p>
<p>I hope others find this tool useful!</p>

  <p>Does your Linux distribution use tools with <code>apt</code> in their name to manage
system packages? If so, your system packages are using Debian packaging.</p>
<p>Most tools interfacing with Debian packages (<code>.deb</code> files) and repositories
use functionality provided by the <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt">apt</a>
repository. This repository provides libraries like <code>libapt</code> as well as
tools like <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt</code>. Most of the functionality is implemented in
C++.</p>
<p>I wanted to raise awareness that I've begun implementing Debian packaging
primitives in pure Rust. The <code>debian-packaging</code> crate is
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/debian-packaging">published on crates.io</a>. For
now, it is developed inside the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer">PyOxidizer repository</a> (because I
like monorepos).</p>
<p>So far, a handful of useful functionality is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing and serializing <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html">control files</a></li>
<li>Reading repository indices files and parsing their content.</li>
<li>Reading HTTP hosted repositories.</li>
<li>Publishing repositories to the filesystem and S3.</li>
<li>Writing changelog files.</li>
<li>Reading and writing <code>.deb</code> files.</li>
<li>Copying repositories.</li>
<li>Creating repositories.</li>
<li>PGP signing and verification operations.</li>
<li>Parsing and sorting version strings.</li>
<li>Dependency syntax parsing.</li>
<li>Dependency resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the <a href="https://docs.rs/debian-packaging/0.9.0/debian_packaging/">documentation</a>
contains all you would want to know for how to use the crate.</p>
<p>The crate is designed to be used as a library so any Rust program can
(hopefully) easily tap the power of the Debian packaging ecosystem.</p>
<p>As with most software, there are likely several bugs and many features not yet
implemented. But I have bulk downloaded the entirety of some distribution's
repositories without running into obvious parse/reading failures. So I'm
reasonably confident that important parts of the code (like control file parsing,
repository indices file handling, and <code>.deb</code> file reading) work as advertised.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone out there finds this work useful!</p>

  <small>May 12, 2021 at 10:30 AM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/git'>Git</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have long held the opinion that you should avoid Git LFS if possible.
Since people keeping asking me why, I figured I'd capture my thoughts
in a blog post so I have something to refer them to.</p>
<p>Here are my reasons for not using Git LFS.</p>
<h2>Git LFS is a Stop Gap Solution</h2>
<p>Git LFS was developed outside the official Git project to fulfill a
very real market need that Git didn't/doesn't handle large files very
well.</p>
<p>I believe it is inevitable that Git will gain better support for
handling of large files, as this seems like a critical feature for
a popular version control tool.</p>
<p>If you make this long bet, LFS is only an interim solution and its
value proposition disappears after Git has better native support
for large files.</p>
<p>LFS as a stop gap solution would be tolerable except for the fact
that...</p>
<h2>Git LFS is a One Way Door</h2>
<p>The adoption or removal of Git LFS in a repository is an irreversible
decision that requires rewriting history and losing your original 
commit SHAs.</p>
<p>In some contexts, rewriting history is tolerable. In many others, it
is an extremely expensive proposition. My experience maintaining
version control in professional contexts aligns with the opinion
that rewriting history is expensive and should only be considered a
measure of last resort. Maybe if tools made it easier to rewrite
history without the negative consequences (e.g. GitHub would redirect
references to old SHA1 in URLs and API calls) I would change my opinion
here. Until that day, the drawbacks of losing history are just too
high to stomach for many.</p>
<p>The reason adoption or removal of LFS is irreversible is due to the
way Git LFS works. What LFS does is change the blob content that a
Git commit/tree references. Instead of the content itself, it stores
a pointer to the content. At checkout and commit time, LFS blobs/records
are treated specially via a mechanism in Git that allows content to be
rewritten as it moves between Git's core storage and its materialized
representation. (The same filtering mechanism is responsible for
normalizing line endings in text files. Although that feature is built
into the core Git product and doesn't work exactly the same way. But
the principles are the same.)</p>
<p>Since the LFS pointer is part of the Merkle tree that a Git commit
derives from, you can't add or remove LFS from a repo without rewriting
existing Git commit SHAs.</p>
<p>I want to explicitly call out that even if a rewrite is acceptable in
the short term, things may change in the future. If you adopt LFS
today, you are committing to a) running an LFS server forever b)
incurring a history rewrite in the future in order to remove LFS from
your repo, or c) ceasing to provide an LFS server and locking out people
from using older Git commits. I don't think any of these are great
options: I would prefer if there were a way to offboard from LFS in
the future with minimal disruption. This is theoretically possible, but
it requires the Git core product to recognize LFS blobs/records natively.
There's no guarantee this will happen. So adoption of Git LFS is a one
way door that can't be easily reversed.</p>
<h2>LFS is More Complexity</h2>
<p>LFS is more complex for Git end users.</p>
<p>Git users have to install, configure, and sometimes know about the
existence of Git LFS. Version control should <em>just work</em>. Large file
handling should <em>just work</em>. End-users shouldn't have to care that
large files are handled slightly differently from small files.</p>
<p>The usability of Git LFS is generally pretty good. However, there's an
upper limit on that usability as long as LFS exists outside the core
Git product. And LFS will likely never be integrated into the core Git
product because the Git maintainers know that LFS is only a stop gap
solution. They would rather solve large files storage <em>correctly</em> than
~forever carry the legacy baggage of having to support LFS in the core
product.</p>
<p>LFS is more complexity for Git server operators as well. Instead of
a self-contained Git repository and server to support, you now have
to support a likely separate HTTP server to facilitate LFS access.
This isn't the hardest thing in the world, especially since we're
talking about key-value blob storage, which is arguably a solved problem.
But it's another piece of infrastructure to support and secure and it
increases the surface area of complexity instead of minimizing it.
As a server operator, I would much prefer if the large file storage
were integrated into the core Git product and I simply needed to provide
some settings for it to <em>just work</em>.</p>
<h2>Mercurial Does LFS Slightly Better</h2>
<p>Since I'm a maintainer of the Mercurial version control tool, I thought
I'd throw out how Mercurial handles large file storage better than
Git. Mercurial's large file handling isn't great, but I believe it
is strictly better with regards to the trade-offs of adopting large
file storage.</p>
<p>In Mercurial, use of LFS is a dynamic feature that server/repo operators
can choose to enable or disable whenever they want. When the Mercurial
server sends file content to a client, presence of external/LFS storage
is a <em>flag</em> set on that file revision. Essentially, the flag says <em>the
data you are receiving is an LFS record, not the file content itself</em> and
the client knows how to resolve that record into content.</p>
<p>Conceptually, this is little different from Git LFS records in terms of
content resolution. However, the big difference is this flag is part
of the repository interchange data, not the core repository data as it
is with Git. Since this flag isn't part of the Merkle tree used to
derive the commit SHA, adding, removing, or altering the content of the
LFS records doesn't require rewriting commit SHAs. The tracked content
SHA - the data now stored in LFS - is still tracked as part of the Merkle
tree, so the integrity of the commit / repository can still be verified.</p>
<p>In Mercurial, the choice of whether to use LFS and what to use LFS for
is made by the server operator and settings can change over time. For
example, you could start with no use of LFS and then one day decide to
use LFS for all file revisions larger than 10 MB. Then a year later
you lower that to all revisions larger than 1 MB. Then a year after
that Mercurial gains better <em>native</em> support for large files and
you decide to stop using LFS altogether.</p>
<p>Also in Mercurial, it is possible for clients to push a large file
<em>inline</em> as part of the push operation. When the server sees that
large file, it can be like <em>this is a large file: I'm going to add
it to the blob store and advertise it as LFS</em>. Because the large
file record isn't part of the Merkle tree, you can have nice things
like this.</p>
<p>I suspect it is only a matter of time before Git's wire protocol learns
the ability to dynamically advertise <em>remote servers</em> for content
retrieval and this feature will be leveraged for better large file
handling. Until that day, I suppose we're stuck with having to
rewrite history with LFS and/or funnel large blobs through Git natively,
with all the pain that entails.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post summarized reasons to avoid Git LFS. Are there justifiable
scenarios for using LFS? Absolutely! If you insist on using Git and
insist on tracking many <em>large</em> files in version control, you
should definitely consider LFS. (Although, if you are a heavy user
of large files in version control, I would consider Plastic SCM instead,
as they seem to have the most mature solution for large files handling.)</p>
<p>The main point of this post is to highlight some drawbacks with
using Git LFS because Git LFS is most definitely not a magic bullet. If
you can stomach the short and long term effects of Git LFS adoption, by
all means, use Git LFS. But please make an informed decision either way.</p>
