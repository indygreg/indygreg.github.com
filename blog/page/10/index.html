  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.4 was released on May 1 (following Mercurial's time-based
schedule of releasing a new version every 3 months).</p>
<p>3.4 is a significant release for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the next version of the wire protocol (<em>bundle2</em>) has been
marked as non-experimental on servers. This version of the protocol
paves over a number of deficiencies in the classic protocol. I won't
go into low-level details. But I will say that the protocol enables
some rich end-user experiences, such as having the server hand out URLs
for pre-generated bundles (e.g. offload clones to S3), atomic push
operations, and advanced workflows, such as having the server rebase
automatically on push. Of course, you'll need a server running 3.4
to realize the benefits of the new protocol. hg.mozilla.org won't be
updated until at least June 1.</p>
<p>Second, Mercurial 3.4 contains improvements to the tags cache to make
performance concerns a thing of the past. Due to the structure of the
Firefox repositories, the previous implementation of the tags cache
could result in pauses of dozens of seconds during certain workflows.
The problem should go away with Mercurial 3.4. <strong>Please note that on
first use of Mercurial 3.4, your repository may perform a one-time
upgrade of the tags cache. This will spin a full CPU core and will
take up to a few minutes to complete on Firefox repos. Let it run to
completion and performance should not be an issue again.</strong> I wrote the
patches to change the tags cache (with lots of help from Pierre-Yves
David, a Mercurial core contributor). So if you find anything wrong,
I'm the one to complain to.</p>
<p>Third, the HTTP interface to Mercurial (hgweb) now has JSON output
for nearly every endpoint. The implementation isn't yet complete,
but it is better than nothing. But, it should be good enough for
services to start consuming it. Again, this won't be available on
hg.mozilla.org until the server is upgraded on June 1 at the earliest.
This is a feature I added to core Mercurial. If you have feature
requests, send them my way.</p>
<p>Fourth, a number of performance regressions introduced in Mercurial
3.3 were addressed. These performance issues frequently manifested
during <em>hg blame</em> operations. Many Mozillians noticed them on
hg.mozilla.org when looking at blame through the web interface.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive list of changes, see
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.version-control/z4aWvBoAGYw/d0hUGKJU_psJ">my post about the 3.4 RC</a>
and the
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_3.4_.282015-05-01.29">official release notes</a>.</p>
<p>3.4 was a significant release. There are compelling reasons to upgrade.
That being said, there were a lot of changes in 3.4. If you want to wait
until 3.4.1 is released (scheduled for June 1) so you don't run into
any regressions, nobody can fault you for that.</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, I recommend reading the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mercurial for Mozillians Installation Page</a>.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Managing URLs in distributed version control tools can be a pain,
especially if multiple repositories are involved. For example,
with Mozilla's repository-based code review workflow (you push to a
special review repository to initiate code review - this is conceptually
similar to GitHub pull requests), there exist
<a href="https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/">separate code review repositories</a>
for each logical repository. Figuring out how repositories map to each
other and setting up remote paths for each new clone can be a pain and
time sink.</p>
<p>As of today, we can now do something better.</p>
<p>If you push to <em>ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/autoreview</em>,
Mercurial will automatically figure out the appropriate review
repository and redirect your push automatically. In other words, if we
have <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> set up to review
whatever repository you are working on,
your push and review request will automatically go through. No need to
figure out what the appropriate review repo is or configure
repository URLs!</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg push review

</pre></div>

<p>Read the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview/install.html#review-repositories">full instructions</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>This requires an updated <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository, which you can get by running <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> from a
Firefox repository.</p>
<p>For those that are curious, the <em>autoreview</em> repo/server advertises a list
of repository URLs and their root commit SHA-1. The client automatically
sends the push to a URL sharing the same root commit. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/rev/0b02cd388590">code</a>
is quite simple.</p>
<p>While this is only implemented for MozReview, I could envision us doing
something similar for other centralized repository-centric services, such
as <em>Try</em> and <em>Autoland</em>. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I attended PyCon last week. It's a great conference. You should attend.
While I should write up a detailed trip report, I wanted to quickly
share one of my takeaways.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> was talked about a lot at PyCon.
Sitting through a few presentations and talking with others helped me
articulate why I've been drawn to Ansible (over say Puppet, Chef, Salt,
etc) lately.</p>
<p>First, Ansible doesn't require a central server. Administration is done
remotely Ansible establishes a SSH connection to a remote machine and
does stuff. Having Ruby, Python, support libraries, etc installed on
production systems just for system administration never really jived
with me. I love Ansible's default hands off approach. (Yes, you can use
a central server for Ansible, but that's not the default behavior. While
tools like Puppet could be used without a central server, it felt like
they were optimized for central server use and thus local mode felt
awkward.)</p>
<p>Related to central servers, I never liked how that model consists of
clients periodically polling for and applying updates. I like the idea
of immutable server images and periodic updates work against this goal.
The central model also has a major bazooka pointed at you: at any time, you
are only one mistake away from completely hosing every machine doing
continuous polling. e.g. if you accidentally update firewall configs and
lock out central server and SSH connectivity, every machine will pick up
these changes during periodic polling and by the time anyone realizes
what's happened, your machines are all effectively bricked. (Yes, I've
seen this happen.) I like having humans control exactly when my systems
apply changes, thank you. I concede periodic updates and central control
have some benefits.</p>
<p>Choosing not to use a central server by default means that hosts are
modeled as a set of applied Ansible playbooks, not necessarily as a host
with a set of Ansible playbooks attached. Although, Ansible does support
both models. I can easily apply a playbook to a host in a one-off
manner. This means I can have playbooks represent common, one-off tasks
and I can easily run these tasks without having to muck around with the
host to playbook configuration. More on this later.</p>
<p>I love the simplicity of Ansible's configuration. It is just YAML files.
Not some Ruby-inspired DSL that takes hours to learn. With Ansible, I'm
learning what modules are available and how they work, not complicated
syntax. Yes, there is complexity in Ansible's configuration. But at
least I'm not trying to figure out the file syntax as part of learning
it.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I appreciate the readability of Ansible playbooks.
They are simple, linear lists of tasks. Conceptually, I love the promise
of full dependency graphs and concurrent execution. But I've spent hours
debugging race conditions and cyclic dependencies in Puppet that I'm left
unconvinced the complexity and power is worth it. I do wish Ansible
could run faster by running things concurrently. But I think they made
the right decision by following KISS.</p>
<p>I enjoy how Ansible playbooks are effectively high-level scripts. If I
have a shell script or block of code, I can usually port it to Ansible
pretty easily. One pass to do the conversion 1:1. Another pass to
Ansibilize it. Simple.</p>
<p>I love how Ansible playbooks can be checked in to source control and
live next to the code and applications they manage. I frequently see
people maintain separate source control repositories for configuration
management from the code it is managing. This always bothered me. When I
write a service, I want the code for deploying and managing that service
to live next to it in version control. That way, I get the configuration
management and the code versioned in the same timeline. If I check out a
release from 2 years ago, I should still be able to use its exact
configuration management code. This becomes difficult to impossible when
your organization is maintaining configuration management code in a
separate repository where a central server is required to do
deployments (see Puppet).</p>
<p>Before PyCon, I was having an internal monolog about adopting the policy
that all changes to remote servers be implemented with Ansible
playbooks. I'm pleased to report that a fellow contributor to the
Mercurial project has adopted this workflow himself and he only has
great things to say! So, starting today, I'm going to try to enforce
that every change I make to a remote server is performed via Ansible and
that the Ansible playbooks are checked into version control. The Ansible
playbooks will become implicit documentation of every process involved
with maintaining a server.</p>
<p>I've already applied this principle to deploying MozReview. Before,
there was some internal Mozilla wiki documenting commands to execute in
a terminal to deploy MozReview. I have replaced that documentation with
a one-liner that invokes Ansible. And, the Ansible files are now
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/1e85a23c4175/ansible">in a public repository</a>.</p>
<p>If you poke around that repository, you'll see that I have Ansible
playbooks referencing Docker. I have Ansible provisioning Docker images
used by the test and development environment. That same Ansible code
is used to configure our production systems (or is at least in the
process of being used in that way). Having dev, test, and prod using the
same configuration management has been a pipe dream of mine and I
finally achieved it! I attempted this before with Puppet but was unable
to make it work just right. The flexibility that Ansible's design
decisions have enabled has made this finally possible.</p>
<p>Ansible is my go to system management tool right now. And I still feel
like I have a lot to learn about its hidden powers.</p>
<p>If you are still using Puppet, Chef, or other tools invented in previous
generations, I urge you to check out Ansible. I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Any time Facebook talks about technical matters I tend to listen.
They have a track record of demonstrating engineering leadership
in several spaces. And, unlike many companies that just talk, Facebook
often gives others access to those ideas via source code and healthy
open source projects. It's rare to see a company operating on the
frontier of the computing field provide so much insight into their
inner workings. You can gain so much by riding their cotails and
following their lead instead of clinging to and cargo culting from
the past.</p>
<p>The Facebook F8 developer conference was this past week. All the
talks are <a href="https://developers.facebooklive.com/">now available online</a>.
<strong>I encourage you to glimpse through the list of talks and watch
whatever is relevant to you.</strong> There's really a little bit for
everyone.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to me is the
<a href="https://developers.facebooklive.com/videos/561/big-code-developer-infrastructure-at-facebook-s-scale">Big Code: Developer Infrastructure at Facebook's Scale</a>
talk. This is highly relevant to my job role as Developer Productivity
Engineer at Mozilla.</p>
<p>My notes for this talk follow.</p>
<p><strong>"We don't want humans waiting on computers. We want computers waiting
on humans."</strong> (This is the common theme of the talk.)</p>
<p>In 2005, Facebook was on Subversion. In 2007 moved to Git. Deployed
a bridge so people worked in Git and had distributed workflow but
pushed to Subversion under the hood.</p>
<p>New platforms over time. Server code, iOS, Android. One Git repo
per platform/project -&gt; 3 Git repos. Initially no code sharing, so
no problem. Over time, code sharing between all repos. Lots of code
copying and confusion as to what is where and who owns what.</p>
<p>Facebook is mere weeks away from completing their migration to
consolidate the big three repos to a Mercurial monorepo. (See also
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">my post about monorepos</a>.)</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easier code sharing.</li>
<li>Easier large-scale changes. Rewrite the universe at once.</li>
<li>Unified set of tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook employees run &gt;1M source control commands per day. &gt;100k
commits per week. VCS tool needs to be fast to prevent distractions
and context switching, which slow people down.</p>
<p>Facebook implemented sparse checkout and shallow history in Mercurial.
Necessary to scale distributed version control to large repos.</p>
<p><strong>Quote from Google: "We're excited about the work Facebook is doing with
Mercurial and glad to be collaborating with Facebook on Mercurial
development."</strong> (Well, I guess the cat is finally out of the bag:
Google is working on Mercurial. This was kind of an open secret for
months. But I guess now it is official.)</p>
<p>Push-pull-rebase bottleneck: if you rebase and push and someone beats
you to it, you have to pull, rebase, and try again. This gets worse
as commit rate increases and people do needless legwork. <strong>Facebook
has moved to server-side rebasing on push</strong> to mostly eliminate this
pain point. (This is part of a still-experimental feature in Mercurial,
which should hopefully lose its experimental flag soon.)</p>
<p>Starting 13:00 in we have a speaker change and move away from version
control.</p>
<p>IDEs don't scale to Facebook scale. <strong>"Developing in Xcode at Facebook
is an exercise in frustration."</strong> On average 3.5 minutes to open
Facebook for iOS in Xcode. 5 minutes on average to index. Pegs CPU
and makes not very responsive. 50 Xcode crashes per day across all
Facebook iOS developers.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook measures everything about tools. Mercurial operation times.
Xcode times. Build times. Data tells them what tools and workflows
need to be worked on.</strong></p>
<p>Facebook believes IDEs are worth the pain because they make people
more productive.</p>
<p>Facebook wants to support all editors and IDEs since people want to
use whatever is most comfortable.</p>
<p>React Native changed things. Supported developing on multiple
platforms, which no single IDE supports. People launched several
editors and tools to do React Native development. People needed 4
windows to do development. That experience was "not acceptable."
So they built their own IDE. Set of plugins on top of ATOM. Not
a fork. They like hackable and web-y nature of ATOM.</p>
<p>The demo showing iOS development looks very nice! Doing Objective-C,
JavaScript, simulator integration, and version control in one window!</p>
<p>It can connect to remote servers and transparently save and
deploy changes. It can also get real-time compilation errors and hints
from the remote server! (Demo was with Hack. Not sure if others langs
supported. Having beefy central servers for e.g. Gecko development
would be a fun experiment.)</p>
<p>Starting at 32:00 presentation shifts to continuous integration.</p>
<p>Number one goal of CI at Facebook is developer efficiency. <strong>We
don't want developers waiting on computers to build and test diffs.</strong></p>
<p>3 goals for CI:</p>
<ol>
<li>High-signal feedback. Don't want developers chasing failures that
   aren't their fault. Wastes time.</li>
<li>Must provide rapid feedback. Developers don't want to wait.</li>
<li>Provide frequent feedback. Developers should know as soon as
   possible after they did something. (I think this refers to local
   feedback.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sandcastle is their CI system.</p>
<p>Diff lifecycle discussion.</p>
<p>Basic tests and lint run locally. (My understanding from talking
with Facebookers is "local" often means on a Facebook server, not
local laptop. Machines at developers fingertips are often dumb
terminals.)</p>
<p>They appear to use code coverage to determine what tests to run.
"We're not going to run a test unless your diff might actually have
broken it."</p>
<p>They run flaky tests less often.</p>
<p>They run slow tests less often.</p>
<p><strong>Goal is to get feedback to developers in under 10 minutes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If they run fewer tests and get back to developers quicker,
things are less likely to break than if they run more tests but
take longer to give feedback.</strong></p>
<p>They also want feedback quickly so reviewers can see results at
review time.</p>
<p>They use Web Driver heavily. Love cross-platform nature of Web Driver.</p>
<p>In addition to test results, performance and size metrics are reported.</p>
<p>They have a "Ship It" button on the diff.</p>
<p>Landcastle handles landing diff.</p>
<p>"It is not OK at Facebook to land a diff without using Landcastle."
(Read: developers don't push directly to the master repo.)</p>
<p>Once Landcastle lands something, it runs tests again. If an issue
is found, a task is filed. Task can be "push blocking."
Code won't ship to users until the "push blocking" issue resolved.
(Tweets confirm they do backouts "fairly aggressively." A valid
resolution to a push blocking task is to backout. But fixing forward
is fine as well.)</p>
<p>After a while, branch cut occurs. Some cherry picks onto release
branches.</p>
<p>In addition to diff-based testing, they do continuous testing runs.
Much more comprehensive. No time restrictions. Continuous runs on
master and release candidate branches. Auto bisect to pin down
regressions.</p>
<p>Sandcastle processes &gt;1000 test results per second. 5 years of machine
work per day. Thousands of machines in 5 data centers.</p>
<p>They started with buildbot. Single master. Hit scaling limits of
single thread single master. Master could not push work to workers
fast enough. Sandcastle has distributed queue. Workers just pull
jobs from distributed queue.</p>
<p>"High-signal feedback is critical." "Flaky failures erode developer
confidence." "We need developers to trust Sandcastle."</p>
<p>Extremely careful separating infra failures from other failures.
Developers don't see infra failures. Infra failures only reported
to Sandcastle team.</p>
<p>Bots look for flaky tests. Stress test individual tests. Run tests
in parallel with themselves. Goal: developers don't see flaky tests.</p>
<p>There is a "not my fault" button that developers can use to report
bad signals.</p>
<p><strong>"Whatever the scale of your engineering organization, developer
efficiency is the key thing that your infrastructure teams should be
striving for. This is why at Facebook we have some of our top
engineers working on developer infrastructure."</strong> (Preach it.)</p>
<p>Excellent talk. <strong>Mozillians doing infra work or who are in charge
of head count for infra work should watch this video.</strong></p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>It's been a <a href="/blog/2015/03/18/network-events/">rough week</a>.</p>
<p>The very short summary of events this week is that both the Firefox
and Firefox OS release automation has been performing a denial of
service attack against
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is nothing new. The release automation
is by far the top consumer of hg.mozilla.org data, requesting several
terabytes per day via several million HTTP requests from thousands of
machines in multiple data centers. The very nature of their existence
makes them a significant denial of service threat.</p>
<p>Lots of things went wrong this week. While a post mortem will shed
light on them, many fall under the umbrella of <em>release automation was
making more requests than it should have and was doing so in a way
that both increased the chances of an outage occurring and increased
the chances of a prolonged outage.</em> This resulted in the hg.mozilla.org
servers working harder than they ever have. As a result, we have some
new <em>high scores</em> to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On UTC day March 19, hg.mozilla.org transferred 7.4 TB of data.
  This is a significant increase from the ~4 TB we expect on a typical
  weekday. (Even more significant when you consider that most load is
  generated during peak hours.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 1300 UTC hour of March 17, the cluster received 1,363,628
  HTTP requests. No HTTP 503 Service Not Available errors were
  encountered in that window! 300,000 to 400,000 requests per hour is
  typical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 0800 UTC hour of March 19, the cluster transferred 776 GB
  of repository data. That comes out to at least 1.725 Gbps on average
  (I didn't calculate TCP and other overhead). Anything greater than 250
  GB per hour is not very common. No HTTP 503 errors were served from
  the origin servers during this hour!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encountered many periods where hg.mozilla.org was operating more than
twice its normal and expected operating capacity and it was able to
handle the load just fine. As a server operator, I'm proud of this.
The servers were provisioned beyond what is normally needed of them and
it took a truly exceptional event (or two) to bring the service down.
This is generally a good way to do hosted services (you rarely want to be
barely provisioned because you fall over at the slighest change and you
don't want to be grossly over-provisioned because you are wasting money
on idle resources).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hg.mozilla.org service did fall over. Multiple times,
in fact. There is room to improve. As proud as I am that the service
operated well beyond its expected limits, I can't help but feel ashamed
that it did eventual cave in under even extreme load and that people are
probably making under-informed general assumptions like <em>Mercurial can't
scale</em>. The simple fact of the matter is that clients cumulatively
generated an exceptional amount of traffic to hg.mozilla.org this week.
All servers have capacity limits. And this week we encountered the limit
for the current configuration of hg.mozilla.org. Cause and effect.</p>
