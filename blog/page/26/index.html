  <p>Usage of machine configuration management software like Puppet
and Chef has taken off in recent years. And rightly so - these
pieces of software make the lives of countless system
administrators much better (in theory).</p>
<p>In their default (and common) configuration, these pieces of
software do a terrific job of ensuring a machine is provisioned with
<em>today's</em> configuration. However, for many server provisioning
scenarios, we actually care about <em>yesterday's</em> configuration.</p>
<p>In this post, I will talk about the importance of time when configuring
machines.</p>
<h2>Describing the problem</h2>
<p>If you've worked on any kind of server application, chances are
you've had to deal with a rollback. Some new version of a package
or web application is rolled out to production. However, due to
unforeseen problems, it needed to be rolled back.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you operate a farm of machines that continuously build
or compile software from version control. It's desirable to be able
to reproduce the output from a previous build (ideally bit
identical).</p>
<p>In these scenarios, the wall time plays a crucial rule when dealing
with a central, master configuration server (such as a Puppet
master).</p>
<p>Since a client will always pull the latest revision of its
configuration from the server, it's very easy to define your
configurations such that the result of machine provisioning
today is different from yesterday (or last week or last month).</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are running Puppet to manage a machine
that sits in a continuous integration farm and recompiles a source
tree over and over. In your Puppet manifest you have:</p>
<pre><code>package {
    "gcc":
        ensure =&gt; latest
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you run Puppet today, you may pull down GCC 4.7 from the remote
package repository because 4.7 is the latest version available. But
if you run Puppet tomorrow, you may pull down GCC 4.8 because the
package repository has been updated! If for some reason you need
to rebuild one of today's builds tomorrow (perhaps you want to
rebuild that revision plus a minor patch), they'll use different
compiler versions (or any package for that matter) and the output
may not be consistent - it may not even work at all! So much for
repeatability.</p>
<p>File templates are another example. In Puppet, file templates are
evaluated on the server and the results are sent to the client. So,
the output of file template execution today might be different from
the output tomorrow. If you needed to roll back your server to an
old version, you may not be able to do that because the template
on the server isn't backwards compatible! This can be worked around,
sure (commonly by copying the template and branching differences),
but over time these hacks accumulate in a giant pile of complexity.</p>
<p>The common issue here is that time has an impact on the outcome of
machine configuration. I refer to this issue as <strong>time-dependent
idempotency</strong>. In other words, does time play a role in the
supposedly idempotent configuration process? If the output is
consistent no matter <em>when</em> you run the configuration, it is
time-independent and truly idempotent. If it varies depending on
when configuration is performed, it is time-dependent and thus
not truly idempotent.</p>
<h2>Solving the problem</h2>
<p>My attitude towards machine configuration and automation is that
it should be as time independent as possible. If I need to revert
to yesterday's state or want to reproduce something that happened
months ago, I want strong guarantees that it will be similar, if not
identical. Now, this is just my opinion. I've worked in environments
where we had these strong guarantees. And having had this luxury,
I abhore the alternative where so many pieces of configuration vary
over time as the central configuration moves forward without the
ability to turn back the clock. As always, your needs may be
different and this post may not apply to you!</p>
<p>I said <em>as possible</em> a few times in the previous paragraph.
While you could likely make all parts of your configuration time
independent, it's not a good idea. In the real world, things
change over time and making all configuration data static regardless
of time will produce a broken or bad configuration.</p>
<p>User access is one such piece of configuration. Employees come and
go. Passwords and SSH keys change. You don't want to revert user
access to the way it was two months ago, restoring access to a
disgruntled former employee or allowing access via a compromised
password. Network configuration is another. Say the network topology
changed and the firewall rules need updating. If you reverted the
networking configuration, the machine likely wouldn't work on the
network!</p>
<p>This highlights an important fact: <strong>if making your machine
configuration time independent is a goal, you will need to
bifurcate configuration by time dependency and solve for both.</strong>
You'll need to identify every piece of configuration and
ask <em>do I put this in the bucket that is constant over time or
the bucket that changes over time?</em></p>
<p>Machine configuration software can do a terrific job of ensuring
an applied configuration is idempotent. The problem is it typically
can't manage both time-dependent and time-independent attributes
at the same time. Solving this requires a little brain power, but
is achievable if there is will. In the next section, I'll describe
how.</p>
<h3>Technical implementation</h3>
<p>Time-dependent machine configuration is a solved problem. Deploy
Puppet master (or similar) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Time-independent configuration is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first step is to isolate all of the
configuration you want to be time independent. Next, you need to
ensure time dependency doesn't creep into that configuration. You
need to identify things that can change over time and take
measures to ensure those changes won't affect the configuration.
I encourage you to employ the <em>external system
test</em>: <em>does this aspect of configuration depend on an external
system or entity? If so how will I prevent changes in it over
time from affecting us?</em></p>
<p>Package repositories are one such external system. New package
versions are released all the time. Old packages are deleted.
If your configuration says to install the <em>latest</em> package, there's
no guarantee the package version won't change unless the package
repository doesn't change. If you simply pin a package to a specific
version, that version may disappear from the server. The solution:
pin packages to specific versions <strong>and</strong> run your own package
mirror that doesn't delete or modify existing packages.</p>
<p>Does your configuration fetch a file from a remote server or use
a file as a template? Cache that file locally (in case it
disappears) and put it under version control. Have the configuration
reference the version control revision of that file. As long as the
repository is accessible, the exact version of the file can be
retrieved at any time without variation.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I've used two separate systems for
managing time-independent configuration data. Both relied heavily
on version control. Essentially, all the time-independent
configuration data is collected into a single repository - an
independent repository from all the time-dependent data
(although that's technically an implementation detail). For Puppet,
this would include all the manifests, modules, and files used
directly by Puppet. When you want to <em>activate</em> a machine with
a configuration, you simply say <em>check out revision X of this
repository and apply its configuration.</em> Since <em>revision X</em> of
the repository is constant over time, the set of configuration
data being used to configure the machine is constant. And, if
you've done things correctly, the output is idempotent over time.</p>
<p>In one of these systems, we actually had two versions of Puppet
running on a machine. First, we had the daemon communicating with a
central Puppet master. It was continually applying time-dependent
configuration (user accounts, passwords, networking, etc). We
supplemented this was a manually executed standalone Puppet
instance. When you ran a script, it asked the Puppet master for its
configuration. Part of that configuration was the revision of the
time-independent Git repository containing the Puppet configuration
files the client should use. It then pulled the Git repo, checked
out the specified revision, merged Puppet master's settings for the
node with that config (not the manifests, just some variables),
then ran Puppet locally to apply the configuration. While a
machine's configuration typically referenced a SHA-1 of a specific
Git commit to use, we could use anything <em>git checkout</em> understood.
We had some machines running <em>master</em> or other branches if we didn't
care about time-independent idempotency for that machine at that
time. What this all meant was that if you wanted to roll back
a machine's configuration, you simply specified an earlier Git
commit SHA-1 and then re-ran local Puppet.</p>
<p>We were largely satisfied with this model. We felt like we got
the best of both worlds. And, since we were using the same
technology (Puppet) for time-dependent and time-independent
configuration, it was a pretty simple-to-understand system.
A downside was there were two Puppet instances instead of one.
With a little effort, someone could probably devise a way for
the Puppet master to <em>merge</em> the two configuration trees. I'll
leave that as an exercise for the reader. Perhaps someone has
done this already! If you know of someone, please leave a comment!</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The solution I describe does not come without its challenges.</p>
<p>First, deciding whether a piece of configuration is time dependent
or time independent can be quiet complicated. For example,
should a package update for a critical security fix be time
dependent or time independent? It depends! What's the risk of
the machine not receiving that update? How often is that machine
rolled back? Is that package important to the operation/role
of that machine (if so, I'd lean more towards time independent).</p>
<p>Second, minimizing exposure to external entities is hard. While
I recommend putting as much as possible under version control in a
single repository and pinning versions everywhere when you interface
with an external system, this isn't always feasible. It's probably
a silly idea to have your 200 GB Apt repository under version
control and distributed locally to every machine in your network.
So, you end up introducing specialized one-off systems as necessary.
For our package repository, we just ran an internal HTTP server that
only allowed inserts (no deletes or mutates). If we were creative, we
could have likely devised a way for the client to pass a <em>revision</em> with
the request and have the server dynamically serve from that revision
of an underlying repository. Although, that may not work for every
server type due to limited control over client behavior.</p>
<p>Third, ensuring compatibility between the time-dependent configuration
and time-independent configuration is hard. This is a consequence of
separating those configurations. Will a time-independent configuration
from a revision two years ago work with the time-dependent
configuration of today? This issue can be mitigated by first
having as much configuration as possible be time independent and
second not relying on wide support windows. If it's good enough
to only support compatibility for time-independent configurations
less than a month old, then it's good enough! With this issue, I feel
you are trading long-term future incompatibility for well-defined
and understood behavior in the short to medium term. That's
a trade-off I'm willing to make.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many machine configuration management systems only care about
idempotency <em>today</em>. However, with a little effort, it's possible
to achieve consistent state over time. This requires a little extra
effort and brain power, but it's certainly doable.</p>
<p>The next time you are programming your system configuration tool, I
hope you take the time to consider the effects time will have and that
you will take the necessary steps to ensure consistency over time
(assuming you want that, of course).</p>

<a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>, <a href='/blog/category/firefox'>Firefox</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have the privilege of having my desk located around a bunch of
really intelligent people from the Mozilla Services team. They've been
talking a lot about all the new technologies around server provisioning.
One that interested me is <a href="http://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Docker is a pretty nifty piece of software. It's essentially a glorified
wrapper around <a href="http://lxc.sourceforge.net/">Linux Containers</a>. But,
calling it that is doing it an injustice.</p>
<p>Docker interests me because it allows simple environment isolation and
repeatability. I can create a run-time environment
once, package it up, then run it again on any other machine.
Furthermore, everything that runs in that environment is isolated from
the underlying host (much like a virtual machine). And best of all,
everything is fast and simple.</p>
<p>For my initial experimentation with Docker, I decided to create an
environment for building Firefox.</p>
<h2>Building Firefox with Docker</h2>
<p>To build Firefox with Docker, you'll first need to
<a href="http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/">install</a> Docker. That's pretty
simple.</p>
<p>Then, it's just a matter of creating a new container with our build
environment:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>curl https://gist.github.com/indygreg/5608534/raw/30704c59364ce7a8c69a02ee7f1cfb23d1ffcb2c/Dockerfile <span class="p">|</span> docker build
</pre></div>

<p>The output will look something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>FROM ubuntu:12.10
MAINTAINER Gregory Szorc &quot;gps@mozilla.com&quot;
RUN apt-get update
===&gt; d2f4faba3834
RUN dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl &amp;&amp; ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl
===&gt; aff37cc837d8
RUN apt-get install -y autoconf2.13 build-essential unzip yasm zip
===&gt; d0fc534feeee
RUN apt-get install -y libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libgtk2.0-dev libiw-dev libnotify-dev libxt-dev mesa-common-dev uuid-dev
===&gt; 7c14cf7af304
RUN apt-get install -y binutils-gold
===&gt; 772002841449
RUN apt-get install -y bash-completion curl emacs git man-db python-dev python-pip vim
===&gt; 213b117b0ff2
RUN pip install mercurial
===&gt; d3987051be44
RUN useradd -m firefox
===&gt; ce05a44dc17e
Build finished. image id: ce05a44dc17e
ce05a44dc17e
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, it is essentially <em>bootstrapping</em> an environment to
build Firefox.</p>
<p>When this has completed, you can activate a shell in the container by
taking the image id printed at the end and running it:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>docker run -i -t ce05a44dc17e /bin/bash
<span class="c1"># You should now be inside the container as root.</span>
su - firefox
hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
<span class="nb">cd</span> mozilla-central
./mach build
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to package up this container for distribution, you just find
its ID then export it to a tar archive:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>docker ps -a
<span class="c1"># Find ID of container you wish to export.</span>
docker <span class="nb">export</span> 2f6e0edf64e8 &gt; image.tar
<span class="c1"># Distribute that file somewhere.</span>
docker import - &lt; image.tar
</pre></div>

<p>Simple, isn't it?</p>
<h2>Future use at Mozilla</h2>
<p>I think it would be rad if Release Engineering used Docker for managing
their Linux builder configurations. Want to develop against the exact
system configuration that Mozilla uses in its automation - you could do
that. No need to worry about custom apt repositories, downloading
custom toolchains, keeping everything isolated from the rest of your
system, etc: Docker does that all automatically. Mozilla simply needs to
publish Docker images on the Internet and anybody can come along and
reproduce the official environment with minimal effort. Once we do that,
there are few excuses for someone breaking Linux builds because of
an environment discrepancy.</p>
<p>Release Engineering could also use Docker to manage isolation of
environments between builds. For example, it could spin up a new
container for each build or test job. It could even save images from the
results of these jobs. Have a weird build failure like a segmentation
fault in the compiler? Publish the Docker image and have someone take a
look! No need to take the builder offline while someone SSH's into it.
No need to worry about the probing changing state because you can always
revert to the state at the time of the failure! And, builds would likely
start faster. As it stands, our automation <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=851294">spends minutes managing
packages</a> before
builds begin. This lag would largely be eliminated with Docker. If
nothing else, executing automation jobs inside a container would allow
us to extract accurate resource usage info (CPU, memory, I/O) since
the Linux kernel effectively gives containers their own namespace
independent of the global system's.</p>
<p>I might also explore publishing Docker images that construct an ideal
development environment (since getting recommended tools in the hands of
everybody is a hard problem).</p>
<p>Maybe I'll even consider hooking up build system glue to automatically
run builds inside containers.</p>
<p>Lots of potential here.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I encourage Linux users to play around with Docker. It enables some
new and exciting workflows and is a really powerful tool despite its
simplicity. So far, the only major faults I have with it are that the
docs say it should not be used in production (yet) and it only works on
Linux.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'd like to make an attempt at delivering regular status updates on the
Gecko/Firefox build system and related topics. Here we go with the
first instance. I'm sure I missed awesomeness. Ping me and I'll add it
to the next update.</p>
<h2>MozillaBuild Windows build environment updated</h2>
<p>Kyle Huey
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/XRecAHF-H28/aSbrdKJLUNoJ">released version 1.7</a>
of our Windows build environment. It contains a newer version of Python
and a modern version of Mercurial among other features.</p>
<p><strong>I highly recommend every Windows developer update ASAP.</strong> Please note
that you will likely encounter Python errors unless you clobber your
build.</p>
<h2>New submodule and peers</h2>
<p>I used my power as module owner to create a submodule of the build
config module whose scope is the (largely mechanical) transition of
content from Makefile.in to moz.build files. I granted Joey Armstrong
and Mike Shal peer status for this module. I would like to eventually
see both elevated to build peers of the main build module.</p>
<h2>moz.build transition</h2>
<p>The following progress has been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Shal has converted variables related to defining XPIDL files in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818246">bug 818246</a>.</li>
<li>Mike Shal converted MODULE in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844654">bug 844654</a>.</li>
<li>Mike Shal converted EXPORTS in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=846634">bug 846634</a>.</li>
<li>Joey Armstrong converted xpcshell test manifests in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844655">bug 844655</a>.</li>
<li>Brian O'Keefe converted PROGRAM in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=862986">bug 862986</a>.</li>
<li>Mike Shal is about to land conversion of CPPSRCS in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=864774">bug 864774</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-recursive XPIDL generation</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=850380">bug 850380</a>
I'm trying to land non-recursive building of XPIDL files. As part of
this I'm trying to combine the generation of .xpt and .h for each input
.idl file into a single process call because profiling revealed that
parsing the IDL consumes most of the CPU time. This shaves a few dozen
seconds off of build times.</p>
<p>I have encounterd multiple pymake bugs when developing this patch, which
is the primary reason it hasn't landed yet.</p>
<h2>WebIDL refactoring</h2>
<p>I was looking at my build logs and noticed WebIDL generation was taking
longer than I thought it should. I filed
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=861587">bug 861587</a> to
investigate making it faster. While my initial profiling turned out to
be wrong, Boris Zbarsky looked into things and discovered that the
serialization and deserialization of the parser output was extremely
slow. He is currently trying to land a refactor of how WebIDL bindings
are handled. The early results look <strong>very</strong> promising.</p>
<p>I think the bug is a good example of the challenges we face improving
the build system, as Boris can surely attest.</p>
<h2>Test directory reorganization</h2>
<p>Joel Maher is injecting sanity into the naming scheme of test
directories in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852065">bug 852065</a>.</p>
<h2>Manifests for mochitests</h2>
<p>Jeff Hammel, Joel Maher, Ted Mielczarek, and I are working out using
manifests for mochitests (like xpcshell tests) in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852416">bug 852416</a>.</p>
<h2>Mach core is now a standalone package</h2>
<p>I extracted the mach core to a
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/mach">standalone repository</a> and
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mach/">added it to PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>Mach now <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856392">categorizes</a>
commands in its help output.</p>
<h2>Requiring Python 2.7.3</h2>
<p>Now that the Windows build environment ships with Python 2.7.4, I've
filed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870420">bug 870420</a>
to require Python 2.7.3+ to build the tree. We already require
Python 2.7.0+. I want to bump the point release because there are
<a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d46c1973d3c4/Misc/NEWS">many</a> small
bug fixes in 2.7.3, especially around Python 3 compatibility.</p>
<p>This is currently blocked on RelEng rolling out 2.7.3 to all the
builders.</p>
<h2>Eliminating master xpcshell manifest</h2>
<p>Now that xpcshell test manifests are defined in moz.build files, we
theoretically don't need the master manifest. Joshua Cranmer is working
on removing them in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=869635">bug 869635</a>.</p>
<h2>Enabling GTests and dual linking libxul</h2>
<p>Benoit Gerard and Mike Hommey are working in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844288">bug 844288</a> to
dual link libxul so GTests can eventually be enabled and executed as
part of our automation.</p>
<p>This will regress build times since we need to link libxul twice. But,
giving C++ developers the ability to write unit tests with a real
testing framework is worth it, in my opinion.</p>
<h2>ICU landing</h2>
<p>ICU was briefly enabled in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=853301">bug 853301</a> but
then backed out because it broke cross-compiling. It should be on track
for enabling in Firefox 24.</p>
<h2>Resource monitoring in mozbase</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=802420">gave mozbase</a>
a class to record system resource usage. I plan to eventually hook this
up to the build system so the build system records how long it took to
perform key events. This will give us better insight into slow and
inefficient parts of the build and will help us track build system speed
improvements over time.</p>
<h2>Sorted lists in moz.build files</h2>
<p>I'm working on requiring lists in moz.build be sorted. Work is happening
in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=863069">bug 863069</a>.</p>
<p>This idea started as a suggestion on the dev-platform list. If anyone
has more great ideas, don't hold them back!</p>
<h2>Smartmake added to mach</h2>
<p>Nicholas Alexander
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=677452">taught mach</a> how
to build intelligently by importing some of Josh Matthews' smartmake
tool's functionality into the tree.</p>
<h2>Source server fixed</h2>
<p>Kyle Huey and Ted Mielczarek
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=846864">collaborated</a> to
fix the source server.</p>
<h2>Auto clobber functionality</h2>
<p>Auto clobber functionality was added to the tree. After flirting briefly
with on-by-default, we changed it to opt-in. When you encounter it, it
will tell you how to enable it.</p>
<h2>Faster clobbers on automation</h2>
<p>I was looking at build logs and identified we were inefficiently
performing clobber.</p>
<p>Massimo Gervasini and Chris AtLee
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=851270">deployed changes</a>
to automation to make it more efficient. My measurements showed a
Windows try build that took 15 fewer minutes to start - a <em>huge</em>
improvement.</p>
<h2>Upgrading to Mercurial 2.5.4</h2>
<p>RelEng is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=741353">tracking</a>
the global deployment of Mercurial 2.5.4. hg.mozilla.org is
currently running 2.0.2 and automation is all over the map. The upgrade
should make Mercurial operations faster and more robust across the
board.</p>
<p>I'm considering adding code to mach or the build system that prompts the
user when her Mercurial is out of date (since an out of date Mercurial
can result in a sub-par user experience).</p>
<h2>Parallelize reftests</h2>
<p>Nathan Froyd is
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=813742">leading an effort</a>
to parallelize reftest execution. If he pulls this off, it could shave
hours off of the total automation load per checkin. Go Nathan!</p>
<h2>Overhaul of MozillaBuild in the works</h2>
<p>I am mentoring a pair of interns this summer. I'm still working out the
final set of goals, but I'm keen to have one of them overhaul the
MozillaBuild Windows development environment. Cross your fingers.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I hold a lot of context in my head when it comes to the future of
Mozilla's build system and the interaction with it. I wanted to
perform a brain dump of sorts so people have an idea of where I'm
coming from when I inevitably propose radical changes.</p>
<h2>The sad state of build system interaction and the history of mach</h2>
<p>I believe that Mozilla's build system has had a poor developer
experience for as long as there has been a Mozilla build system.
Getting started with Firefox development was a rite of passage. It
required following (often out-of-date) directions on MDN. It
required finding pages through MDN search or asking other people
for info over IRC. It was the kind of process that turned away
potential contributors because it was just too damn hard.</p>
<p>mach - while born out of my initial efforts to radically change
the build system proper - morphed into a generic command
dispatching framework by the time it landed in mozilla-central.
It has one overarching purpose: provide a single gateway point for
performing common developer tasks (such as building the tree and
running tests). The concept was nothing new - individual developers
had long coded up scripts and tools to streamline workflows. Some
even published these for others to use. What set mach apart was a
unified interface for these <em>commands</em> (the mach script in the
top directory of a checkout) and that these productivity gains
were <strong>in the tree</strong> and thus easily discoverable and usable by
<em>everybody</em> without significant effort (just run <em>mach help</em>).</p>
<p>While mach doesn't yet satisfy everyone's needs, it's slowly
growing new features and making developers' lives easier with
every one. All of this is happening despite that there
is not a single person tasked with working on mach full time.
Until a few months ago, mach was largely my work. Recently, Matt
Brubeck has been contributing a flurry of enhancements - thanks
Matt! Ehsan Akhgari and Nicholas Alexander have contributed a
few commands as well! There are also a few people with a single
command to their name. This is fulfilling my original vision of
facilitating developers to scratch their own itches by
contributing mach commands.</p>
<p>I've noticed more people referencing mach in IRC channels. And,
more people get angry when a mach command breaks or changes
behavior. So, I consider the mach experiment a success. Is it
perfect, no. If it's not good enough for you, please file a bug
and/or code up a patch. If nothing else, please tell me: I love to
know about everyone's subtle requirements so I can keep them in
mind when refactoring the build system and hacking on mach.</p>
<h2>The object directory is a black box</h2>
<p>One of the ideas I'm trying to advance is that the object directory
should be considered a black box for the majority of developers. In
my ideal world, developers don't need to look inside the object
directory. Instead, they interact with it through condoned and
supported tools (like mach).</p>
<p>I say this for a few reasons. First, as the build config module owner
I would like the ability to massively refactor the <em>internals</em> of
the object directory without disrupting workflows. If people are
interacting directly with the object directory, I get significant
push back if things change. This inevitably holds back much-needed
improvements and triggers resentment towards me, build peers, and
the build system. Not a good situation. Whereas if people are
indirectly interacting with the object directory, we simply need to
maintain a consistent interface (like mach) and nobody should care
if things change.</p>
<p>Second, I believe that the methods used when directly interacting
with the object directory are often sub-par compared with going
through a more intelligent tool and that productivity suffers as a
result. For example, when you type <em>make</em> in inside the object
directory you need to know to pass <em>-j8</em>, use make vs pymake,
and that you also need to build <em>toolkit/library</em>, etc.
Also, by invoking make directly, you bypass other handy features,
such as automatic compiler warning aggregation (which only happens
if you invoke the build system through mach). If you go through a
tool like <em>mach</em>, you <em>should</em> automatically get the most ideal
experience possible.</p>
<p>In order for this vision to be realized, we need massive
improvements to tools like mach to cover the missing workflows that
still require direct object directory interaction. We also need people
to start using mach. I think increased mach usage comes after mach
has established itself as obviously superior to the alternatives
(I already believe it offers this for tasks like running tests).</p>
<h2>I don't want to force mach upon people but...</h2>
<p>Nobody likes when they are forced to change a process that has been
familiar for years. Developers especially. I get it. That's why
I've always attempted to position mach as an alternative to
existing workflows. If you don't like mach, you can always fall
back to the previous workflow. Or, you can improve mach (patches
more than welcome!). Having gone down the
please-use-this-tool-it's-better road before at other
organizations, I strongly believe that the best method to incur
adoption of a new tool is to gradually sway people through
obvious superiority and praise (as opposed to a mandate to switch).
I've been trying this approach with mach.</p>
<p>Lately, more and more people have been saying things like
<em>we should have the build infrastructure build through mach
instead of client.mk</em> and <em>why do we need testsuite-targets.mk when
we have mach commands.</em> While I personally feel that client.mk
and testsuite-targets.mk are antiquated as a developer-facing
interface compared to mach, I'm reluctant to eliminate them because
I don't like forcing change on others. That being said, there are
compelling reasons to eliminate or at least refactor how they work.</p>
<p>Let's take <em>testsuite-targets.mk</em> as an example. This is the make
file that provides the targets to run tests (like <em>make xpcshell-test</em>
and <em>make mochitest-browser-chrome</em>). What's interesting about this
file is that it's only used in local builds: our automation
infrastructure does not use <em>testsuite-targets.mk</em>! Instead,
<em>mozharness</em> and the old buildbot configs manually build up the
command used to invoke the test harnesses. Initially, the mach
commands for running tests simply invoked make targets defined
in <em>testsuite-targets.mk</em>. Lately, we've been converting the mach
commands to invoke the Python test runners directly. I'd argue that
the logic for <em>invoke the test runner</em> only needs to live in one
place in the tree. Furthermore as a build module peer, I have little
desire to support multiple implementations. Especially considering
how fragile they can be.</p>
<p>I think we're trending towards an outcome where mach (or the code
behind mach commands) transitions into the authoratitive invocation
method and <em>legacy</em> interfaces like <em>client.mk</em> and
<em>testsuite-targets.mk</em> are reimplemented to either call mach
commands or the same routine that powers them. Hopefully this
will be completely transparent to developers.</p>
<h2>The future of mozconfigs and environment configuration</h2>
<p><em>mozconfig</em> files are shell scripts used to define variables consumed
by the build system. They are the only officially supported mechanism
for configuring how the build system works.</p>
<p>I'd argue mozconfig files are a mediocre solution at best. First,
there's the issue of mozconfig statements that don't actually do
anything. I've seen no-op mozconfig content cargo culted into the
in-tree mozconfigs (used for the builder configurations)! Oops.
Second, doing things in mozconfig files is just awkward. Defining
the object directory requires <em>mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=some-path</em>.
What's <em>mk_add_options</em>? If <em>some-path</em> is relative, what is it
relative <em>to</em>? While certainly addressable, the documentation on
how mozconfig files work is not terrific and fails to explain many
pitfalls. Even with proper documentation, there's still the issue
of the file format allowing no-op variable assignments to persist.</p>
<p>I'm very tempted to reinvent build configuration as something not
mozconfigs. What exactly, I don't know. mach has support for ini-like
configuration files. We could certainly have mach and the build
system pull configs from the same file.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what's going to happen here. But deprecating mozconfig
files as they are today is part of many of the options.</p>
<h2>Handling multiple mozconfig files</h2>
<p>A lot of developers only have a single mozconfig file (per source tree
at least). For these developers, life is easy. You simply install
your mozconfig in one of the default locations and it's automagically
used when you use mach or client.mk. Easy peasy.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the relative numbers are, but many developers
maintain multiple mozconfig files per source tree. e.g. they'll
have one mozconfig to build desktop Firefox and another one for
Android. They may have debug variations of each.</p>
<p>Some developers even have a single mozconfig file but leverage the
fact that mozconfig files are shell scripts and have their
mozconfig dynamically do things depending on the current working
directory, value of an environment variable, etc.</p>
<p>I've also seen wrapper scripts that glorify setting environment
variables, changing directory, etc and invoke a command.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about providing a common and well-supported
solution for switching between active build configurations.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach#Adding_mach_to_your_shell%27s_search_path">Installing mach on $PATH</a>
goes a long way to facilitate this. If you are in an object
directory, the mozconfig used when that object directory was
created is automatically applied. Simple enough. However, I want
people to start treating object directories as black boxes. So, I'd
rather not see people have their shell inside the object directory.</p>
<p>Whenever I think about solutions, I keep arriving at a
virtualenv-like solution. Developers would potentially need to
<em>activate</em> a Mozilla build environment (similar to how Windows
developers need to launch MozillaBuild). Inside this environment,
the shell prompt would contain the name of the current build
configuration. Users could switch between configurations using
<em>mach switch</em> or some other magic command on the $PATH.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I'm skeptical if people would find this useful. I'm
not sure it's that much better than exporting the MOZCONFIG
environment variable to define the active config. This one requires
more thought.</p>
<h2>The integration between the build environment and Python</h2>
<p>We use Python extensively in the build system and for common
developer tasks. mach is written in Python. moz.build processing
is implemented in Python. Most of the test harnesses are written in
Python.</p>
<p>Doing practically anything in the tree requires a Python
interpreter that knows about all the Python code in the tree and
how to load it.</p>
<p>Currently, we have two very similar Python environments. One is
a virtualenv created while running configure at the beginning of
a build. The other is essentially a cheap knock-off that mach
creates when it is launched.</p>
<p>At some point I'd like to consolidate these Python environments.
From any Python process we should have a way to automatically
bootstrap/activate into a well-defined Python environment. This
certainly sounds like establishing a unified Python virtualenv
used by both the build system and mach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things aren't straightforward. The virtualenv today
is constructed in the object directory. How do we determine the
current object directory? By loading the mozconfig file. How do we
do that? Well, if you are mach, we use Python. And, how does mach
know where to find the code to load the mozconfig file? You can
see the dilemma here.</p>
<p>A related issue is that of portable build environments. Currently, a
lot of our automation recreates the build system's virtualenv from
its own configuration (not that from the source tree). This has
and will continue to bite us. We'd <em>really</em> like to package up the
virtualenv (or at least its config) with tests so there is no
potential for discrepancy.</p>
<p>The inner workings of how we integrate with Python should be
invisible to most developers. But, I figured I'd capture it
here because it's an annoying problem. And, it's also related
to an <em>activated</em> build environment. What if we required all
developers to <em>activate</em> their shell with a Mozilla build
environment (like we do on Windows)? Not only would this solve
Python issues, but it would also facilitate simpler config
switching (outlined above). Hmmm...</p>
<h2>Direct interaction with the build system considered harmful</h2>
<p>Ever since there was a build system developers have been typing
<em>make</em> (or <em>make.py</em>) to build the tree. One of the goals of the
transition to <em>moz.build</em> files is to facilitate building the tree
with Tup. <em>make</em> will do nothing when you're not using Makefiles!
Another goal of the <em>moz.build</em> transition is to start
derecursifying the make build system such that we build things in
parallel. It's likely we'll produce monolithic make files and then
process <em>all</em> targets for a related class <em>IDLs</em>, <em>C++ compilation</em>,
etc in one invocation of <em>make</em>. So, uh, what happens during a partial
tree build? If a .cpp file from <em>/dom/src/storage</em> is being handled by
a monolithic make file invoked by the Makefile at the top of the
tree, how does a partial tree build pick that up? Does it build just
that target or every target in the monolithic/non-recursive make file?</p>
<p>Unless the build peers go out of our way to install redundant targets
in leaf Makefiles, directly invoking <em>make</em> from a subdirectory of
the tree won't do what it's done for years.</p>
<p>As I said above, I'm sympathetic to forced changes in procedure, so
it's likely we'll provide backwards-compatibile behavior. But, I'd
prefer to not do it. I'd first prefer partial-tree builds are not
necessary and a full tree build finishes quickly. But, we're not going
to get there for a bit. As an alternative, I'll take people building
through <em>mach build</em>. That way, we have an easily extensible interface
on which to build partial tree logic. We saw this recently when
dumbmake/smartmake landed. And, going through <em>mach</em> also reinforces my
ideal that the object directory is a black box.</p>
<h2>Semi-persistent state</h2>
<p>Currently, most state as it pertains to a checkout or build is in the
object directory. This is fine for artifacts from the build system.
However, there is a whole class of state that arguably shouldn't be in
the object directory. Specifically, it shouldn't be clobbered when you
rebuild. This includes logs from previous builds, the warnings database,
previously failing tests, etc. The list is only going to grow over time.</p>
<p>I'd like to establish a location for semi-persistant state related to
the tree and builds. Perhaps we change the clobber logic to ignore a
specific directory. Perhaps we start storing things in the user's home
directory. Perhaps we could establish a second <em>object directory</em> named
the <em>state directory</em>? How would this interact with <em>build environments</em>?</p>
<p>This will probably sit on the backburner until there is a compelling use
case for it.</p>
<h2>The battle against C++</h2>
<p>Compiling C++ consumes the bulk of our build time. Anything we can do to
speed up C++ compilation will work wonders for our build times.</p>
<p>I'm optimistic things like precompiled headers and compiling multiple
.cpp files with a single process invocation will drastically decrease
build times. However, no matter how much work we put in to make C++
compilation faster, we still have a giant issue: dependency hell.</p>
<p>As <a href="/presentations/2012-11-29-firefox-build-system/#34">shown</a> in my
build system presentation a few months back, we have dozens of header
files included by hundreds if not thousands of C++ files. If you change
one file: you invalidate build dependencies and trigger a rebuild. This
is why whenever files like mozilla-config.h change you are essentially
confronted with a full rebuild. ccache may help if you are lucky. But, I
fear that as long as headers proliferate the way they do, there is
little the build system by itself can do.</p>
<p>My attitude towards this is to wait and see what we can get out of
precompiled headers and the like. Maybe that makes it good enough. If
not, I'll likely be making a lot of noise at Platform meetings
requesting that C++ gurus brainstorm on a solution for reducing
header proliferation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Belive it or not, these are only some of the topics floating around in
my head! But I've probably managed to bore everyone enough so I'll
call it a day.</p>
<p>I'm always interested in opinions and ideas, especially if they are
different from mine. I encourage you to leave a comment if you have
something to say.</p>

  <small>May 13, 2013 at 01:25 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have an opinion on the usage of Mercurial at Mozilla: it stinks.</p>
<p>Here's why.</p>
<h2>The server is configured poorly</h2>
<p>Our Mozilla server, hg.mozilla.org, is currently running Mercurial 2.0.2.
In terms of Mercurial features, stability, and performance, we are light
years behind.</p>
<p>You know that annoying phases configuration you need to set when pushing
to Try? That's because the server isn't new enough to tell the client the
same thing the configuration option does. It
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=725362">will be fixed</a>
when the server is upgraded to 2.1+.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are running the server over NFS, which introduces known
badness, including slowness.</p>
<p>I believe we blame Mercurial for issues that would go away if we
configured the Mercurial server properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it appears the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781012">upgrade to 2.5</a>
is near and I've heard we're moving from NFS to local disk storage as
part of that. This should go a long way to making the server better.
The upgrade can't happen soon enough.</p>
<h2>User education is poor</h2>
<p>I think a lot of people are ignorant on the features and abilities of
Mercurial.</p>
<p>I commonly hear people are dissatisfied with the behavior of their
Mercurial client. They encounter performance issues, bugs, corruption,
etc. Nine times out of ten this is due to running an old Mercurial
release. Just last Friday someone on my team asked me about
weird behavior involving file case. My first question: <em>what version
of Mercurial are you using?</em> He was running 2.0.2. I told him to
upgrade to 2.5+. It fixed his problem. <strong>If you aren't running
Mercurial 2.5 or newer, upgrade immediately.</strong></p>
<p>I've heard people say we should switch to Git because Git has feature X.
Most of the time, Mercurial has these features. Unfortunately, people
just don't realize it. When I point them at
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UsingExtensions">Mercurial's extensions list</a>
their eyes light up and they thank me for making their lives easier.</p>
<p>I think a problem is a lot of new Mozilla contributors knew Git
before and only pick up the bare essentials of Mercurial that allow them
to land patches. They prefer Git because it is familiar and just don't
bother to pick up Mercurial. The potential of Mercurial is thus lost on
them.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should have a brown bag and/or better documentation on
getting the most out of Mercurial?</p>
<h2>The branching model is far from ideal</h2>
<p>For Gecko/Firefox development, we maintain separate repositories for the
trunk and release branches. This introduces all kinds of annoying.</p>
<p>We should not have separate repositories for <em>central</em>, <em>inbound</em>,
<em>aurora</em>, <em>beta</em>, <em>release</em>, etc. We should be using some combination of
branches and bookmarks and have all the release heads in one
repository, just like how the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central/">GitHub mirror</a> is
configured.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I created a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko">unified Mercurial repository</a>.
Each current repository is tracked as a bookmark (there are
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial">instructions</a>
for reproducing this). Unfortunately, the web interface isn't showing
bookmarks (perhaps because the version of Mercurial is too old?), so
you'll have to clone the repository to play around. Just run
<em>hg bookmarks</em> and e.g. <em>hg up aurora</em> after cloning.
<em>Warning: I'm not actively synchronizing this repository, so don't rely
on it being up to date</em>.</p>
<p>A Mercurial contributor (who is familiar with Mozilla's
development model) suggested we use Mercurial branches for every Gecko
release (20, 21, 22, etc). I think this and other uses of branches and
bookmarks are ideas worth exploring.</p>
<h2>We're failing to harness the extensibility</h2>
<p>Gecko/Firefox has a complicated code lifecycle and landing process.
This could be significantly streamlined if we fully harnessed and
embraced the extensibility of Mercurial. While there are some
Mozilla-centric extensions (details in my
<a href="/blog/2013/05/12/thoughts-on-mercurial-%28and-git%29/">recent post</a>),
I don't think they are well known nor used.</p>
<p>I think Mozilla should embrace the functionality of extensions like
these (whether they be for Mercurial, Git, or something else) and invest
resources in improving the workflows for all developers. Until these
tools are obviously superior and advertised, I believe many developers
will unknowingly continue to toil without them. And, it's likely hurting
our ability to attract and retain new contributors as well.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mozilla's current usage of Mercurial is far from ideal. It's no wonder
people don't like Mercurial (and why some want to switch to Git).</p>
<p>Fortunately, little has to do with shortcomings of Mercurial itself (at
least with newer versions). If you want to know why Mercurial isn't
working too well for Gecko/Firefox development, most of the problems
are self-inflicted or the solutions reside within each of us. Time
will tell if we as a community have the will to address these issues.</p>
