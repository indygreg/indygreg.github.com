  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.6 (scheduled for release on or shortly after November 1)
contains a number of improvements to cloning. In this post, I will
describe a new feature to help server operators reduce load (while
enabling clients to clone faster) and some performance work to make
clone operations faster on the client.</p>
<p>Cloning repositories can incur a lot of load on servers. For
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a> (the main
Firefox repository), clones require the server to spend 4+ minutes CPU
time and send ~1,230 MB over the network. Multiply by thousands of
clients from build and test automation and developers, and you could
quickly finding yourself running out of CPU cores or network bandwidth.
Scaling Mercurial servers (like many services) can therefore be
challenging. (It's worth noting that Git is in the same boat for
reasons technically similar to Mercurial's.)</p>
<p>Mozilla previously implemented a Mercurial extension to
<a href="/blog/2015/05/29/faster-cloning-from-hg.mozilla.org-with-server-provided-bundles/">seed clones from pre-generated bundle files</a>
so the Mercurial servers themselves don't have to work very hard for
an individual clone. (That linked post goes into the technical
reasons why cloning is expensive). We now offload cloning of frequently
cloned repositories on <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> to
<a href="/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">Amazon S3</a> and
<a href="/blog/2015/09/01/serving-mercurial-clones-from-a-cdn/">a CDN</a> and
are diverting 1+ TB/day and countless hours of CPU work away from the
hg.mozilla.org servers themselves.</p>
<p>The positive impact from seeding clones from pre-generated,
externally-hosted bundles has been immense. Load on hg.mozilla.org
dropped off a cliff. Clone times on clients became a lot faster (mainly
because they aren't waiting for a server to dynamically generate/stream
bits). But there was a problem with this approach: it required the
cooperation of clients to install an extension in order for clone load
to be offloaded. It didn't <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm pleased to announce that the ability to seed clones from
server-advertised pre-generated bundles is now a core feature in
Mercurial 3.6!</strong> Server operators can install the
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/file/default/hgext/clonebundles.py">clonebundles extension</a> (it is distributed with Mercurial)
to advertise the location of pre-generated, externally-hosted bundle
files. Compatible clients will automatically clone from the
server-advertised URLs instead of creating potentially excessive load
on the Mercurial server. The implementation is almost identical to what
Mozilla has deployed with great success. <strong>If you operate a Mercurial
server that needs to serve larger repositories (100+ MB) and/or is under
high load, you should be jumping with joy at the existence of this
feature, as it should make scaling problems attached to cloning mostly
go away.</strong></p>
<p>Documentation for server operators is currently in the extension and
can be accessed at the aforementioned URL or with
<em>hg help -e clonebundles</em>. It does require a bit of setup work. But
if you are at the scale where you could benefit from the feature, the
results will almost certainly be worth it.</p>
<p>One caveat is that the feature is currently behind an <em>experimental</em>
flag on the client. This means that it doesn't <em>just work</em> yet. This
is because we want to reserve the right to change some behaviors without
worrying about backwards compatibility. However, I'm pretty confident
the server parts won't change significantly. Or if they do, I'm pretty
committed to providing an easy transition path since I'll need one for
hg.mozilla.org. So, I'm giving server operators a tentative
green light to deploy this extension. I can't guarantee there won't be a
few bumps transitioning to a future release. But it shouldn't be a
break-the-world type of problem. It is my intent to remove the
experimental flag and have the feature enabled by default in
Mercurial 3.7. At that point, server operators just need clients to run
a modern Mercurial release and they can count on drastically reduced
load from cloning.</p>
<p>To help with adoption and testing of the <em>clone bundles</em> feature,
servers advertising bundles will inform compatible clients of the
existence of the feature when they clone:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
requesting all changes
remote: this server supports the experimental &quot;clone bundles&quot; feature that should enable faster and more reliable cloning
remote: help test it by setting the &quot;experimental.clonebundles&quot; config flag to &quot;true&quot;
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
...
</pre></div>

<p>And if you have the feature enabled, you'll see something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
applying clone bundle from https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/mozilla-central/daa7d98525e859d32a3b3e97101e129a897192a1.gzip.hg

</pre></div>

<p>This new <em>clone bundles</em> feature is deployed on hg.mozilla.org. Users of
Mercurial 3.6 can start using it today by cloning from one of the
<a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">repositories with bundles enabled</a>. (If
you have previously installed the <em>bundleclone</em> extension, please be
sure your <em>version-control-tools</em> repository is up to date, as the
extension was recently changed to better interact with the official
feature.)</p>
<p>And that's the <em>clone bundles</em> feature. I hope you are as excited about
it as I am!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 also contains numerous performance improvements that make
cloning faster, regardless of whether you are using <em>clone bundles</em>! For
starters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/836291420d53">Caching just-added entries</a>
  made changelog writing 25% faster.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/39d643252b9f">Reusing file handles</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced the number of file
  opens, closes, and writes.</li>
<li><a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/56a640b0f656">Avoiding excessive file flushing</a>
  when adding revlog entries drastically reduced system call count.</li>
</ul>
<p>These performance enhancements will make all operations that write
new repository data faster. But it will be felt most on clone and pull
operations on the client and push operations on the server.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive performance optimizations was to a Python
class that converts a generator of raw data chunks to something that
resembles a file object so it can be read() from.
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/6ae14d1ca3aa">Refactoring read()</a>
to avoid <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>
operations and an extra string slice and allocation made <em>unbundle</em>
operations 15-20% faster. Since this function can handle hundreds of
megabytes or even gigabytes of data across hundreds of thousands of
calls, small improvements like this can make a huge difference! This
patch was a stark reminder that function calls, collection mutations,
string slicing, and object allocation all can have a significant cost
in a higher-level, garbage collected language like Python.</p>
<p>The end result of all this performance optimization on applying a
mozilla-central gzip bundle on Linux on an i7-6700K:</p>
<ul>
<li>35-40s wall time faster (~245s to ~205s) (~84% of original)</li>
<li>write(2) calls reduced from 1,372,411 to 679,045 (~49% of
  original)</li>
<li>close(2) calls reduced from 405,147 to 235,039 (~58% of
  original)</li>
<li>total system calls reduced from 5,120,893 to 2,938,479 (~57% of
  original)</li>
</ul>
<p>And the same operation on Windows 10 on the same machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>~300s wall time faster (933s to 633s) (~68% of original)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed the discrepancy between Linux and Windows wall
times, where Windows is 2-4x slower than Linux. What gives? The reason
is closing file handles that have been appended to is slow on Windows.
For more, read my <a href="/blog/2015/10/22/append-i/o-performance-on-windows/">recent blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Mercurial writes ~226,000 files during a clone of mozilla-central
(excluding the working copy). Assuming 2ms per file close operation,
that comes out to <strong>~450s just for file close operations</strong>! (All
operations are on the same thread.) The current wall time difference
between clone times on Windows and Linux is ~428s. So it's fair to say
that waiting on file closes accounts for most of this.</p>
<p>Along the same vein, the aforementioned performance work reduced total
number of file close operations during a mozilla-central clone by
~165,000. Again assuming 2ms per file close, that comes to ~330s, which
is in the same ballpark as the ~300s wall time decrease we see on
Windows in Mercurial 3.6. <strong>Writing - and therefore closing - hundreds
of thousands of files handles is slower on Windows and accounts for most
of the performance difference on that platform.</strong></p>
<p>Empowered by this knowledge, I wrote some patches to move file closing
to a background thread on Windows. The results were
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-September/073788.html">promising</a>
(minutes saved when writing 100,000+ files). Unfortunately, I didn't
have time to finish these patches for Mercurial 3.6. Hopefully they'll
make it into 3.7. I also have some mad scientist ideas for alternate
storage mechanisms that don't rely on hundreds of thousands of files.
This should enable clones to run at 100+ MB/s on all platforms -
basically as fast as your network and system I/O can keep up (yes,
Python and Windows are capable of this throughput). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>And that's a summary of the cloning improvements in Mercurial 3.6!</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.6 is currently in release candidate. Please help test
it by downloading the RC at
<a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a>.
Mercurial 3.6 final is due for release on or shortly after November 1.
There is a large gathering of Mercurial contributors in London this
weekend. So if a bug is reported, I can pretty much guarantee a lot of
eyeballs will see it and there's a good chance it will be acted upon.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A few weeks ago, some coworkers were complaining about the relative
performance of Mercurial cloning on Windows. I investigated on my
brand new i7-6700K Windows 10 desktop machine and sure enough they were
correct: cloning times on Windows were several minutes slower than
Linux on the same hardware. What gives?</p>
<p>I performed a few clones with Python under a profiler. It pointed to a
potential slowdown in file I/O. I wanted more details so I fired up
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896645.aspx">Sysinternals Process Monitor</a>
(strace for Windows) and captured data for a clone.</p>
<p>As I was looking at the raw system calls related to I/O, something
immediately popped out: <em>CloseFile()</em> operations were frequently
taking 1-5 <em>milliseconds</em> whereas other operations like opening, reading,
and writing files only took 1-5 <em>microseconds</em>. <strong>That's a 1000x
difference!</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a custom Python script to analyze an export of Process Monitor's
data. Sure enough, it said we were spending hundreds of seconds in
<em>CloseFile()</em> operations (it was being called a few hundred thousand
times). I posted the findings to some mailing lists.
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/yupx2ToQ5T4/WAMC_Q-DCAAJ">Follow-ups</a>
in Mozilla's dev-platform list pointed me to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/23/10215586.aspx">an old MSDN blog post</a>
where it documents behavior similar to what I was seeing.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>closing file handles that have been appended to is
slow on Windows.</strong> This is apparently due to an implementation detail of
NTFS. Writing to a file in place is fine and only takes microseconds for
the open, write, and close. But if you append a file, closing the
associated file handle is going to take a few milliseconds. Even if you
are using Overlapped I/O (async I/O on Windows), the <em>CloseHandle()</em>
call to close the file handle blocks the calling thread! Seriously.</p>
<p>This behavior is in stark contrast to Linux and OS X, where system I/O
functions take microseconds (assuming your I/O subsystem can keep up).</p>
<p>There are two ways to work around this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the amount of file closing operations on appended files.</li>
<li>Use multiple threads for I/O on Windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, I dug into the guts of Mercurial and
proceeded to write a
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/836291420d53">number</a>
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/39d643252b9f">of</a>
<a href="https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/56a640b0f656">patches</a>
that drastically reduced the amount of file I/O system calls during
clone and pull operations. While I intend to write a blog post with the
full details, <strong>cloning the Firefox repository with Mercurial 3.6 on
Windows is now several minutes faster.</strong> Pretty much all of this is due
to reducing the number of file close operations by aggressively reusing
file handles.</p>
<p>I also
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-September/073788.html">experimented</a>
with moving file close operations to a separate thread on Windows. While
this change didn't make it into Mercurial 3.6, the results were very
promising. Even on Python (which doesn't have real asynchronous threads
due to the GIL), moving file closing to a background thread freed up the
main thread to do the CPU heavy work of processing data. This made clones
several minutes faster. (Python does release the GIL when performing an
I/O system call.) Furthermore, <strong>simply creating a dedicated thread for
closing file handles made Mercurial faster than 7-zip at writing tens of
thousands of files from an uncompressed tar archive</strong>. (I'm not going to
post the time for <em>tar</em> on Windows because it is embarassing.) That's a
Python process on Windows faster than a native executable that is lauded
for its speed (7-zip). Just by offloading file closing to a single
separate thread. Crazy.</p>
<p>I can optimize file closing in Mercurial all I want. However,
Mercurial's storage model relies on several files. For the Firefox
repository, we have to write ~225,000 files during clone. Assuming
1ms per file close (which is generous), that's 225s (or 3:45) wall
time performing file closes. That's not going to scale. I've already
started experimenting with alternative storage modes that initially use
1-6 files. This should enable Mercurial clones to run at over 100 MB/s
(yes, Python and Windows can do I/O that quickly if you are smart about
things).</p>
<p>My primary takeaway is that creating/appending to thousands of files
is slow on Windows and should be addressed at the architecture level
by not requiring thousands of files and at the implementation level
by minimizing the number of file close operations after write.
If you absolutely must create/append to thousands of files, use multiple
threads for at least closing file handles.</p>
<p>My secondary takeaway is that Sysinternals Process Monitor is amazing.
I used it against Firefox and immediately found
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1211090">performance concerns</a>.
It can be extremely eye opening to see how your higher-level code
is translated into function calls into your operating system and where
the performance hot spots are or aren't at the OS level.</p>

  <p>For the past few months, Mozilla has been
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">serving Mercurial clones from Amazon S3</a>.
We upload snapshots (called <em>bundles</em>) of large and/or high-traffic
repositories to S3. We have a custom Mercurial extension on the
client and server that knows how to exchange the URLs for these
snapshots and to transparently use them to bootstrap a clone. The
end result is drastically reduced Mercurial server load and faster
clone times. The benefits are seriously ridiculous when you operate
version control at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a CDN.
You can easily configure it up to be backed by an S3 bucket. So
we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/</a> is
Mozilla's CDN for hosting Mercurial data. Currently it's just bundles to
be used for cloning.</p>
<p>As of today, if you
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">install the bundleclone Mercurial extension</a>
and <em>hg clone</em> a repository on
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> such as
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>), the CDN
URLs will be preferred by default. (Previously we preferred S3 URLs
that hit servers in Oregon, USA.)</p>
<p><strong>This should result in clone time reductions for Mozillians not
close to Oregon, USA</strong>, as the CloudFront CDN has servers all across
the globe and your Mercurial clone should be bootstrapped from the
closest and hopefully therefore fastest server to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need the the aforementioned <em>bundleclone</em>
extension installed for this to work. But, this should only be
temporary: I've
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StaticBundlePlan">proposed</a>
integrating this feature into the core of Mercurial so if a client
talks to a server advertising pre-generated bundles the clone
offload <em>just works</em>. I already have tentative buy-in from one
Mercurial maintainer. So hopefully I can land this feature in
Mercurial 3.6, which will be released November 1. After that,
I imagine some high-traffic Mercurial servers (such as Bitbucket)
will be very keen to deploy this so CPU load on their servers
is drastically reduced.</p>

use <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234</a>.
The full list of web commands, URL patterns, and their parameters are
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/help/hgweb">documented</a> in
the <em>hgweb</em> help topic.</p>
<p>Not all web commands support JSON output yet. Not all web commands
expose all data available to them. If there is data you need but isn't
exposed, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>
and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Steven MacLeod for
<a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/15617/">reviewing</a> the rather large
series it took to make this happen.</p>
