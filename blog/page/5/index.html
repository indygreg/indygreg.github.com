  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>For the past few months, Mozilla has been
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/07/08/cloning-from-s3/">serving Mercurial clones from Amazon S3</a>.
We upload snapshots (called <em>bundles</em>) of large and/or high-traffic
repositories to S3. We have a custom Mercurial extension on the
client and server that knows how to exchange the URLs for these
snapshots and to transparently use them to bootstrap a clone. The
end result is drastically reduced Mercurial server load and faster
clone times. The benefits are seriously ridiculous when you operate
version control at scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a CDN.
You can easily configure it up to be backed by an S3 bucket. So
we did.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/">https://hg.cdn.mozilla.net/</a> is
Mozilla's CDN for hosting Mercurial data. Currently it's just bundles to
be used for cloning.</p>
<p>As of today, if you
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">install the bundleclone Mercurial extension</a>
and <em>hg clone</em> a repository on
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> such as
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>), the CDN
URLs will be preferred by default. (Previously we preferred S3 URLs
that hit servers in Oregon, USA.)</p>
<p><strong>This should result in clone time reductions for Mozillians not
close to Oregon, USA</strong>, as the CloudFront CDN has servers all across
the globe and your Mercurial clone should be bootstrapped from the
closest and hopefully therefore fastest server to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do need the the aforementioned <em>bundleclone</em>
extension installed for this to work. But, this should only be
temporary: I've
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/StaticBundlePlan">proposed</a>
integrating this feature into the core of Mercurial so if a client
talks to a server advertising pre-generated bundles the clone
offload <em>just works</em>. I already have tentative buy-in from one
Mercurial maintainer. So hopefully I can land this feature in
Mercurial 3.6, which will be released November 1. After that,
I imagine some high-traffic Mercurial servers (such as Bitbucket)
will be very keen to deploy this so CPU load on their servers
is drastically reduced.</p>

  <p>I added a feature to Mercurial 3.4 that exposes JSON from Mercurial's
various <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/help/hgweb">web APIs</a>.
Unfortunately, due to the presence of legacy code on hg.mozilla.org
providing similar functionality, we weren't able to deploy this
feature to hg.mozilla.org when we deployed Mercurial 3.4 several weeks
ago.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that as of today, JSON is now exposed from
hg.mozilla.org!</p>
<p>To access JSON output, simply add <strong>json-</strong> to the <em>command</em> name
in URLs. e.g. instead of
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/de7aa6b08234">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/de7aa6b08234</a>
use <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-rev/de7aa6b08234</a>.
The full list of web commands, URL patterns, and their parameters are
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/help/hgweb">documented</a> in
the <em>hgweb</em> help topic.</p>
<p>Not all web commands support JSON output yet. Not all web commands
expose all data available to them. If there is data you need but isn't
exposed, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20hg.mozilla.org">file a bug</a>
and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Steven MacLeod for
<a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/15617/">reviewing</a> the rather large
series it took to make this happen.</p>

  <p>Sometime last week we enabled a new API on hg.mozilla.org:
<em>json-mozbuildinfo</em>. This endpoint will return JSON describing
moz.build-derived metadata about the files that changed in a commit.</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/json-mozbuildinfo/1164ec236273">Example</a>.
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/mozbuildinfo.html">Docs</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to eventually leverage this API to do cool things like
have MozReview automatically file bugs in the appropriate component and
assign appropriate reviewers given the set of changed files in a commit.</p>
<p>The API is currently only available on mozilla-central. And, we have
very conservative resource limits in place. So large commits may cause
it to error out. As such, the API is considered experimental. Also,
performance is not as optimal as it could be. You have to start
somewhere.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Guillaume Destuynder (kang) for his help with the
security side of things. When I started on this project, I didn't think
I'd be writing
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/02e353037996/testing/docker/builder-hgweb-chroot/mozbuild-eval.c">C code for spawning secure processes</a>,
but here we are. In the not so distant future, I'll likely be adding
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a>
into the mix, which will make the execution environment as
or more secure than the Firefox content process sandbox, depending
on how it is implemented. The rabbit holes we find ourselves in to
implement proper security...</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Just a few minutes ago, hg.mozilla.org reached an important milestone:
deployments are now performed via Ansible from our open source
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository instead of via Puppet from Mozilla's private <em>sysadmins</em>
repository. This is important for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the code behind the operation of hg.mozilla.org is now open source
and available for the public to see and change. I strive for my work at
Mozilla to be open by default. With hg.mozilla.org's private Puppet
repository, people weren't able to see what was going on under the
covers. Nor were they empowered to change anything. This may come as a
shock, but even I don't have commit privileges to the internal Puppet
repository that was previously powering hg.mozilla.org! I did have read
access. But any change I wanted to make involved me proxying it through
one of two people. It was tedious, made me feel uncomfortable for having to
nag people to do my work, and slowed everyone down. We no longer have this
problem, thankfully.</p>
<p>Second, having the Ansible code in version-control-tools enables us to
use the same operational configuration in production as we do in our
Docker test environment. I can now spin up a cluster of Docker
containers that behave very similarly to the production servers (which
aren't running Docker). This enables us to write end-to-end tests of
complex systems running across multiple Docker containers and have
relatively high confidence that our production and testing environments
behave very similarly. In other words, I can test complex interactions
between multiple systems all from my local machine - even from a plane!
For example, we can and do test that SSH connections to a simulated
production environment running in Docker behave as expected, complete
with an OpenSSH server speaking to an OpenLDAP server for SSH public
key lookup. While we still have many tests to write, we had no such
tests a year ago and every production deployment was a
cross-your-fingers type moment. Having comprehensive tests gives us
confidence to move fast and not break things.</p>
<p>One year ago, hg.mozilla.org's infrastructure was opaque, didn't have
automated tests, and was deployed too seldomly. There was the often
correct perception that changing this critical-to-Mozilla service was
difficult and slow. Today, things couldn't be more different. <strong>The
hg.mozilla.org infrastructure is open, we have tests, and we can and
do deploy multiple times per day without forward notice and without
breaking things.</strong> I love this brave new world of open infrastructure
and moving fast.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.5 was released today (following Mercurial's time-based
schedule of releasing a new version every 3 months).</p>
<p>There were roughly 1000 commits between 3.4 and 3.5, making this a
busy version. Although, 1000 commits per release has become the new
norm, as development on Mercurial has accelerated in the past few
years.</p>
<p>In my mind, the major highlight of Mercurial 3.5 is that the new
<em>bundle2</em> wire protocol for transferring data during <em>hg push</em>
and <em>hg pull</em> is now enabled by default on the client. Previously,
it was enabled by default only on the server.
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> is running Mercurial 3.4,
so clients that upgrade to 3.5 today will be speaking to it using
the new wire protocol.</p>
<p>The <em>bundle2</em> wire protocol succeeds the existing protocol
(which has been in place for years) and corrects many of its
deficiencies. Before bundle2, pull and push operations were not
atomic because Mercurial was performing a separate API call for
each piece of data. It would start by transferring changeset data
and then have subsequent transfers of metadata like bookmarks
and phases. As you can imagine, there were race conditions and
scenarios where pushes could be incomplete (not atomic). bundle2
transfers all this data in one large chunk, so there are much
stronger guarantees for data consistency and for atomic operations.</p>
<p>Another benefit of bundle2 is it is a fully extensible data exchange
format. Peers can add additional <em>parts</em> to the payload. For
extensions that wish to transfer additional metadata (like
Mozilla's <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/pushlog.html">pushlog</a>
data), they can simply add this directly into the data
stream without requiring additional requests over the wire protocol.
This translates to fewer network round trips and faster push and pull
operations.</p>
<p>The <em>progress</em> extension has been merged into Mercurial's core and
is enabled by default. It is now safe to remove the
<em>extensions.progress</em> config option from your hgrc.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.5 also (finally) drops support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
Hopefully nobody reading this is still running these ancient and
unsupported versions of Python. This is a win for Mercurial developers,
as we were constantly having to work around deficiencies with these old
Python releases. There were dozens of commits removing hacks and
workarounds for Python 2.4 and 2.5. Dropping 2.4 and 2.5 also
means Python 3 porting can begin in earnest. However, this isn't a high
priority for anyone, so don't hold your breath.</p>
<p>There were a number of performance improvements in 3.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>operations involving obsolescence markers are faster (for users of
  changeset evolution)</li>
<li>various revsets were optimized</li>
<li>parts of phases calculation are now performed in C. The <em>not public()</em>
  revset should be much faster.</li>
<li><em>hg status</em> and things walking the filesystem are faster (Mozillians
  should be using <em>hgwatchman</em> to make <em>hg status</em> insanely fast)</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>ui.allowemptycommit</em> config option was introduced to control whether
empty commits are allowed. Mozillians manually creating <em>trychooser</em>
commits may run into problems creating empty commits without this
option (a better solution is to use <em>mach push-to-try</em>).</p>
<p>Work is progressing on per-directory manifests. Currently, Mercurial
stores the mapping of files to content in a giant list called the
manifest. For repositories with tens or hundreds of thousands of
files, decoding and reading large manifests is very CPU intensive.
Work is being done to enable Mercurial to split manifests by directory.
So instead of a single manifest, there are several. This is a prequisite
to <em>narrow clone</em>, which is the ability to clone history for a subset
of files (like how Subversion works). This work will eventually enable
repositories with millions of files to exist without significant
performance loss. It will also allow
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">monolithic repositories</a>
to exist without the common critique that they are too unwieldy to
use because they are so large.</p>
<p><em>hgignore</em> files now have an <em>include:</em> and <em>subinclude:</em> syntax that
can be used to include other files containing ignore rules. This
feature is useful for a number of reasons. First, it makes sense for
ignore rules to live in the directory hierarchy next to paths they
impact. Second, for people working with monolithic repositories, it
means you can <em>export</em> a sub-directory of your monorepo (to e.g. a
Git repository) and its ignore rules - being defined in local
directories - can still work. (I'm pretty sure Facebook is using this
approach to make its syncing of directories/projects from its Mercurial
monorepo to GitHub easier to manage.)</p>
<p>Significant work has been done on the template parser. If you have
written custom templates, you may find that Mercurial 3.5 is more
strict about parsing certain syntax.</p>
<p>Revsets with chained <em>or</em> no longer result in stack exhaustion. Before,
programmatically generated revsets like <em>1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6...</em>
would likely fail.</p>
<p>Interactions with servers over SSH should now display server output in
real time. Before, server output was buffered and only displayed at the
end of the operation. (You may not see this on hg.mozilla.org until
the server is upgraded to 3.5, which is planned for early September.)</p>
<p>There are now static analysis checks in place to ensure that Mercurial
config options have corresponding documentation in <em>hg help config</em>.
As a result, a lot of formerly undocumented options are now documented.</p>
<p>I contributed
<a href="/blog/2015/07/31/my-contributions-to-mercurial-3.5/">various improvements</a>.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>auto sharing repository data during clone</li>
<li>clone and pull performance improvements</li>
<li><em>hg help scripting</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There were tons of other changes, of course. See the
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_3.5_.282015-07-31.29">official release notes</a>
and the
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UpgradeNotes#A3.5:_no_more_support_for_Python_2.4_or_2.5">upgrade notes</a>

article provides a Mozilla tailored yet generally applicable guide for
installing or upgrading Mercurial to 3.5. As always, conservative
software users may want to wait until September 1 for the 3.5.1 point
release to fix any issues or regressions from 3.5.</p>
