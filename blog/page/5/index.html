  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>At Mozilla, I often hear statements like <em>Mercurial is slow.</em> That's a
very general statement. Depending on the context, it can mean one or
more of several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Mercurial workflow is not very efficient</li>
<li><em>hg</em> commands I execute are slow to run</li>
<li><em>hg</em> commands I execute appear to stall</li>
<li>The Mercurial server I'm interfacing with is slow</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to spend time talking about a specific problem: why
hg.mozilla.org (the server) is slow.</p>
<h2>What Isn't Slow</h2>
<p><strong>If you are talking to hg.mozilla.org over HTTP or HTTPS
(https://hg.mozilla.org/), there should not currently be any server
performance issues</strong>. Our Mercurial HTTP servers are pretty beefy and
are able to absorb a lot of load.</p>
<p>If https://hg.mozilla.org/ is slow, chances are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are doing something like cloning a 1+ GB repository.</li>
<li>You are asking the server to do something really expensive (like
  generate JSON for 100,000 changesets via the pushlog query interface).</li>
<li>You don't have a high bandwidth connection to the server.</li>
<li>There is a network event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Previous Network Events</h2>
<p>There have historically been network capacity issues in the datacenter
where hg.mozilla.org is hosted (SCL3).</p>
<p>During Mozlandia, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">excessive traffic to ftp.mozilla.org</a>
essentially saturated the SCL3 network. During this time, requests to
hg.mozilla.org were timing out: Mercurial traffic just couldn't traverse
the network. Fortunately, events like this are quite rare.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Firefox release automation was effectively
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096337">overwhelming the network</a>
by doing some clownshoesy things.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096653">gaia-central was being cloned all the time</a>
We had a ~1.6 GB repository being cloned over a thousand times per day. We
were transferring close to 2 TB of gaia-central data out of Mercurial servers
per day</p>
<p>We also found issues with
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096650">pushlogs sending 100+ MB responses</a>.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1100574">build/tools repo was getting cloned for every job</a>. Ditto for mozharness.</p>
<p>In all, <strong>we identified a few terabytes of excessive Mercurial traffic
that didn't need to exist</strong>. This excessive traffic was saturating the
SCL3 network and slowing down not only Mercurial traffic, but other
traffic in SCL3 as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, people from Release Engineering were quick to respond to
and fix the problems once they were identified. The problem is now
firmly in control. Although, given the scale of Firefox's release
automation, any new system that comes online that talks to version
control is susceptible to causing server outages. I've already raised
this concern when reviewing some TaskCluster code. The thundering herd
of automation will be an ongoing concern. But I have plans to further
mitigate risk in 2015. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Looking back at our historical data, it appears that we hit these
network saturation limits a few times before we reached a tipping point
in early November 2014. Unfortunately, we didn't realize this because up
until recently, we didn't have a good source of data coming from the
servers. We lacked the tooling to analyze what we had. We lacked the
experience to know what to look for. Outages are effective flashlights.
We learned a lot and know what we need to do with the data moving
forward.</p>
<h2>Available Network Bandwidth</h2>
<p>One person pinged me on IRC with the comment <em>Git is cloning much faster
than Mercurial.</em> I asked for timings and the Mercurial clone wall time
for Firefox was much higher than I expected.</p>
<p>The reason was network bandwidth. This person was performing a Git clone
between 2 hosts in EC2 but was performing the Mercurial clone between
hg.mozilla.org and a host in EC2. In other words, they were partially
comparing the performance of a 1 Gbps network against a link over the
public internet! When they did a fair comparison by removing the network
connection as a variable, the clone times rebounded to what I expected.</p>
<p>The single-homed nature of hg.mozilla.org in a single datacenter in
northern California is not only bad for disaster recovery reasons, it
also means that machines far away from SCL3 or connecting to SCL3 over a
slow network aren't getting optimal performance.</p>
<p>In 2015, expect us to build out a geo-distributed hg.mozilla.org so that
connections are hitting a server that is closer and thus faster. This
will probably be targeted at Firefox release automation in AWS first. We
want those machines to have a fast connection to the server <strong>and</strong> we
want their traffic isolated from the servers developers use so that
hiccups in automation don't impact the ability for humans to access
and interface with source code.</p>
<h2>NFS on SSH Master Server</h2>
<p>If you connect to http://hg.mozilla.org/ or https://hg.mozilla.org/, you
are hitting a pool of servers behind a load balancer. These servers have
repository data stored on local disk, where I/O is fast. In reality,
most I/O is serviced by the page cache, so local disks don't come into
play.</p>
<p>If you connect to ssh://hg.mozilla.org/, you are hitting a single,
master server. Its repository data is hosted on an NFS mount. I/O on the
NFS mount is horribly slow. Any I/O intensive operation performed on the
master is much, much slower than it should be. Such is the nature of
NFS.</p>
<p>We'll be exploring ways to mitigate this performance issue in 2015. But
it isn't the biggest source of performance pain, so don't expect anything
immediately.</p>
<h2>Synchronous Replication During Pushes</h2>
<p>When you <em>hg push</em> to hg.mozilla.org, the changes are first made on the
SSH/NFS master server. They are subsequently mirrored out to the HTTP
read-only slaves.</p>
<p>As is currently implemented, the mirroring process is performed
synchronously during the push operation. The server waits for the
mirrors to complete (to a reasonable state) before it tells the client
the push has completed.</p>
<p>Depending on the repository, the size of the push, and server and
network load, <strong>mirroring commonly adds 1 to 7 seconds to push times</strong>.
This is time when a developer is sitting at a terminal, waiting for <em>hg
push</em> to complete. The time for Try pushes can be larger: 10 to 20
seconds is not uncommon (but fortunately not the norm).</p>
<p>The current mirroring mechanism is overly simple and prone to many
failures and sub-optimal behavior. I plan to work on fixing mirroring in
2015. When I'm done, there should be no user-visible mirroring delay.</p>
<h2>Pushlog Replication Inefficiency</h2>
<p>Up until yesterday (when we
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112415">deployed a rewritten pushlog extension</a>,
the replication of pushlog data from master to server was very
inefficient. Instead of tranferring a delta of pushes since last pull,
we were literally copying the underlying SQLite file across the network!</p>
<p>Try's pushlog is ~30 MB. mozilla-central and mozilla-inbound are in the
same ballpark. 30 MB x 10 slaves is a lot of data to transfer. These
operations were capable of periodically saturating the network, slowing
everyone down.</p>
<p>The rewritten pushlog extension performs a delta transfer automatically
as part of <em>hg pull</em>. Pushlog synchronization now completes in
milliseconds while commonly only consuming a few kilobytes of network
traffic.</p>
<p>Early indications reveal that deploying this change yesterday decreased the
push times to repositories with long push history by 1-3s.</p>
<h2>Try</h2>
<p>Pretty much any interaction with the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try">Try repository</a> is guaranteed to have poor
performance. The Try repository is doing things that distributed
versions control systems weren't designed to do. This includes Git.</p>
<p>If you are using Try, all bets are off. Performance will be problematic
until we roll out the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1055298">headless try</a>
repository.</p>
<p>That being said, we've made changes recently to make Try perform better.
<a href="https://twitter.com/lxt/status/546042588822642688">The median time for pushing to Try</a>
has decreased significantly in the past few weeks. The first dip in
mid-November was due to upgrading the server from Mercurial 2.5 to
Mercurial 3.1 and from converting Try to use <em>generaldelta</em> encoding.
The dip this week has been from merging all heads and from deploying the
aforementioned pushlog changes. <strong>Pushing to Try is now significantly
faster than 3 months ago.</strong></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many of the reasons for hg.mozilla.org slowness are known. More often
than not, they are due to clownshoes or inefficiencies on Mozilla's
part rather than fundamental issues with Mercurial.</p>
<p><strong>We have made significant progress at making hg.mozilla.org faster.</strong>
But we are not done. We are continuing to invest in fixing the
sub-optimal parts and making hg.mozilla.org faster yet. I'm confident
that within a few months, nobody will be able to say that the servers
are a source of pain like they have been for years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mercurial is investing in features to make the wire
protocol faster, more efficient, and more powerful. When deployed,
these should make pushes faster on <em>any</em> server. They will also enable
workflow enhancements, such as Facebook's experimental extension to
perform rebases as part of push (eliminating push races and having to
manually rebase when you lose the push race).</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mach/">mach</a> - the generic command line
dispatching tool that powers the <strong>mach</strong> command to aid Firefox
development - now has support for sub-commands.</p>
<p>You can now create simple and intuitive user interfaces involving
sub-actions. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>mach device sync
mach device run
mach device delete
</code></pre>
<p>Before, to do something like this would require a universal argument
parser or separate mach commands. Both constitute a poor user
experience (confusing array of available arguments or proliferation of
top-level commands). Both result in <em>mach help</em> being difficult to
comprehend. And that's not good for usability and approachability.</p>
<p>Nothing in Firefox currently uses this feature. Although there is an
in-progress patch in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1108293">bug 1108293</a>
for providing a mach command to analyze C/C++ build dependencies.
It is my hope that others write useful commands and functionality
on top of this feature.</p>
<p>The documentation for mach has also been rewritten. It is now
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Tree_Documentation/python/mach/index.html">exposed</a>
as part of the in-tree Sphinx documentation.</p>
<p>Everyone should thank <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ahal/">Andrew Halberstadt</a>
for promptly reviewing the changes!</p>

  <p>Today was one crazy day.</p>
<p>The build peers all sat down with Release Engineering and Axel Hecht
to talk l10n packaging. <a href="http://glandium.org/">Mike Hommey</a> has a
Q1 goal to fix l10n packaging. There is buy-in from Release
Engineering on enabling him in his quest to slay dragons. This
will make builds faster and will pay off a massive mountain of
technical debt that plagues multiple groups at Mozilla.</p>
<p>The Firefox build system contributors sat down with a bunch of
Rust people and we talked about what it would take to integrate
Rust into the Firefox build system and the path towards shipping
a Rust component in Firefox. It sounds like that is going to
happen in 2015 (although we're not yet sure what component will
be written in Rust). I consider it an achievement that the gathering
of both groups didn't result in infinite rabbit holing about
system architectures, toolchains, and the build people telling
<em>horror stories</em> to wide-eyed Rust people about the crazy things
we have to do to build and ship Firefox. Believe me, the
temptation was there.</p>
<p>People interested in the build system all sat down and reflected on
the state of the build system and where we want to go. We agreed
to create a build mode optimized for non-Gecko developers
that downloads pre-built binaries - avoiding ~10 minutes of
C/C++ compile time for builds. Mark my words, this will be one
of those changes that once deployed will cause people to say
"I can't believe we went so long without this."</p>
<p>I joined Mark Côté and others to talk about priorities for
MozReview. We'll be making major improvements to the UX and
integrating static analysis into reviews. Push a patch for
review and have machines do some of the work that humans are
currently doing! We're tentatively planning a get-together in
Toronto in January to sprint towards awesomeness.</p>
<p>I ended the day by giving a long and rambling presentation about
version control, with emphasis on Mercurial. I can't help but
feel that I talked way too much. There's just so much knowledge
to cover. A few people told me afterwards they learned a lot. I'd
appreciate feedback if you attended. Anyway, I got a few nods
from people as I was saying some somewhat contentious things.
It's always good to have validation that I'm not on an island
when I say crazy things.</p>
<p>I hope to spend Friday chasing down loose ends from the week.
This includes talking to some security gurus about another crazy
idea of mine to integrate PGP into the code review and code
landing workflow for Firefox. I'll share more details once
I get a professional opinion on the security front.</p>

  <p>You may have noticed the Firefox trees
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">were closed</a>
for the better part of yesterday.</p>
<p>Long story short, a file containing URLs for Firefox installers was
updated to reference https://ftp.mozilla.org/ from
http://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/. The original, latter
host is a CDN. The former is not. When thousands of clients started
hitting ftp.mozilla.org, it overwhelmed the servers and network,
causing timeouts and other badness.</p>
<p>The change in question was accidental. It went through code review.
From a code change standpoint, procedures were followed.</p>
<p>It is tempting to point fingers at the people involved. However, I
want us to consider placing blame elsewhere: on the code review
tool.</p>
<p>The diff being reviewed was to change the Firefox version number
from 32.0 to 32.0.3. If you were asked to review this
patch, I'm guessing your eyes would have glanced over everything in the
URL except the version number part. I'm pretty sure mine would have.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what the reviewer saw in Bugzilla/Splinter (click
to see full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-splinter.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-splinter.png" width="600" />
</a></p>
<p>And here is what the reviewer would have seen had the review been
conducted in MozReview:</p>
<p><a href="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png">
<img src="/images/intraline-reviewboard.png" width="600">
</a></p>
<p>Which tool makes the change of hostname more obvious? Bugzilla/Splinter
or MozReview?</p>
<p><strong>MozReview's support for intraline diffs more clearly draws attention to
the hostname change. I posit that had this patch been reviewed with
MozReview, the chances are greater we wouldn't have had a network
outage yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>And it isn't just intraline diffs that make Splinter/Bugzilla a
sub-optimal code review tool. I recently blogged about the
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">numerous ways that using Bugzilla for code revie results in harder
reviews and buggier
code</a>.
Every day we continue using Bugzilla/Splinter instead of investing in
better code review tools is a day severe bugs like this can and will
slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>If there is any silver lining to this outage, I hope it is that we need
to double down on our investment in developer tools, particularly code
review.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial and Git both experience scaling pains as the number of heads
in a repository approaches infinity. Operations like push and pull
slow to a crawl and everyone gets frustrated.</p>
<p>This is the problem Mozilla's Try repository has been dealing with
for years. We know the solution doesn't scale. But we've been content
kicking the can by resetting the repository (blowing away data)
to make the symptoms temporarily go away.</p>
<p>One of my official goals is to ship a scalable Try solution by the end
of 2014.</p>
<p>Today, I believe I finally have enough code cobbled together to
produce a working concept. <strong>And I could use your help testing it.</strong></p>
<p>I would like people to push their Try, code review, and other
miscellaneous heads to a special repository. To do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ hg push -r . -f ssh://hg@hg.gregoryszorc.com/gecko-headless
</code></pre>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the changeset belonging to the working copy</li>
<li>Allow the creation of new heads</li>
<li>Send it to the <em>gecko-headless</em> repo on hg.gregoryszorc.com using
  SSH</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what happening.</p>
<p>I have deployed a special repository to my personal server that I
believe will behave very similarly to the final solution.</p>
<p>When you push to this repository, instead of your changesets being
applied directly to the repository, it siphons them off to a Mercurial
bundle. It then saves this bundle somewhere along with some metadata
describing what is inside.</p>
<p>When you run <em>hg pull -r <node></em> on that repository and ask for a
changeset that exists in the bundle, the server does some magic
and returns data from the bundle file.</p>
<p>Things this repository doesn't do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This repository will not actually send changesets to Try for you.</strong></li>
<li>You cannot <code>hg pull</code> or <code>hg clone</code> the repository and get all of the
  commits from bundles. This isn't a goal. It will likely never be
  supported.</li>
<li>We do not yet record a pushlog entry for pushes to the repository.</li>
<li>The hgweb HTML interface does not <strong>yet</strong> handle commits that only
  exist in bundles. People want this to work. It will eventually work.</li>
<li>Pulling from the repository over HTTP with a vanilla Mercurial install
  may not preserve phase data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this experiment is to expose the repository to some
actual traffic patterns so I can see what's going on and get a feel
for real-world performance, variability, bugs, etc. I plan to do all
of this in the testing environment. But I'd like some real-world
use on the actual Firefox repository to give me peace of mind.</p>
<p>Please report any issues directly to me. Leave a comment here. Ping
me on IRC. Send me an email. etc.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-11-21: People discovered a bug with pushed changesets
accidentally being advanced to the public phase, despite the repository
being non-publishing. I have fixed the issue. But you must now push to
the repository over SSH, not HTTP.</strong></p>
