  <p>When you push code changes to Firefox and other similar Mozilla
projects, a flood of automated jobs is triggered on Mozilla's
infrastructure. It works like any other continuous integration
system. First you build, then you run tests, etc. What sets it
apart from other continuous integration systems is the size:
Mozilla runs thousands of jobs per week and the combined output
sums into the tens of gigabytes.</p>
<p>Most of the data from Mozilla's continuous integration is
available on public servers, notably ftp.mozilla.org. This includes
compiled binaries, logs, etc.</p>
<p>While there are tools that can sift through this mountain of data
(like <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org">TBPL</a>), they don't allow ad-hoc
queries over the raw data. Furthermore, these tools are very
function-specific and there are many data views they don't expose.
This <em>missing</em> data has always bothered me because, well, there
are cool and useful things I'd like to do with this data.</p>
<p>This itch has been bothering me for well over a year. The
persistent burning sensation coupled with rain over the weekend
caused me to scratch it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/mozilla-build-analyzer">product of my weekend labor</a>
is a system facilitating bulk storage and analysis of Mozilla's
build data. While it's currently very alpha, it's already showing
promise for more throrough data analysis.</p>
<p>Essentially, the tool works by collecting the dumps of all the jobs
executed on Mozilla's infrastructure. It can optionally supplement
this with the raw logs from those jobs. Then, it combs through this
data, extracts useful bits, and stores them. Once the initial
fetching has completed, you simply need to re-"parse" the data set
into useful data. And, since all data is stored locally, the
performance of this is not bound by Internet bandwidth. In practice,
this means that you can obtain a new metric faster than would have
been required before. The downside is you will likely be storing
gigabytes of raw data locally. But, disks are cheap. And, you have
control over what gets pulled in, so you can limit it to what you
need.</p>
<p>Please note the project is very alpha and is only currently serving
my personal interests. However, I know there is talk about <em>TBPL2</em>
and what I have built could evolve into the data store for the next
generation TBPL tool. Also, most of the work so far has centered on
data import. There is tons of analysis code waiting to be written.</p>
<p>If you are interested in improving the tool, please file a GitHub
pull request.</p>
<p>I hope to soon blog about useful information I've obtained through this
tool.</p>

  <p>Matt Brubeck recently landed an awesome patch for mach in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=840588">bug 840588</a>:
it allows mach to be used by any directory. I'm calling it
<em>omnipresent mach</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, Matt changed the <em>mach</em> driver (the script in the root
directory of mozilla-central) so instead of having it look in hard-coded
relative paths for all its code, it walks up the directory tree and
looks for signs of the source tree or the object directory.</p>
<p>What this all means is that if you have the <em>mach</em> script installed in
your $PATH and you just type <em>mach</em> in your shell from within any source
directory or object directory, <em>mach</em> should just work. So, no more
typing <em>./mach</em>: just copy <em>mach</em> to <em>~/bin</em>, <em>/usr/local/bin</em> or some
other directory on your $PATH and you should just be able to type
<em>mach</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are bound to be bugs here. Since <em>mach</em>
traditionally was only executed with the current working directory as
the top source directory, some commands are not prepared to handle a
variable current working directory. Some commands will likely get
confused when it comes resolving relative paths, etc. If you find
an issue, please report it! A temporary workaround is to just invoke
mach from the top source directory like you've always been doing.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the feature, thank Matt: this was completely his idea and
he saw it through from conception to implementation.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The next time you update mozilla-central you may notice some significant
changes with the build system. That's because this morning we finally
landed the start of a massive overhaul of the build system! There are
many end goals to this effort. The important ones for most will be
faster build times and a build system that is friendlier to make changes
to.</p>
<h2>Introducing moz.build Files</h2>
<p>If you look in the tree, you'll notice that nearly every directory
now has a <em>moz.build</em> file.</p>
<p><em>moz.build</em> files are what we are using to define the build system. Think of
them each as a descriptor that describes how to build its own part of the
tree. An individual <em>moz.build</em> file will contain the C++ sources to
compile, the headers to export, the tests to run, etc. Eventually.
Currently, they are limited to directory traversal information.</p>
<p><em>moz.build</em> files essentially add a level of indirection between the
build system definition and how the tree is actually built. Before
<em>moz.build</em> files, the same metadata we are now capturing in <em>moz.build</em>
files (or plan to capture) was captured in <em>Makefile.in</em> files. We
performed simple variable substitution on these <em>Makefile.in</em> files to
produce <em>Makefile</em> files in the object directory. These <em>Makefile</em> files
were used by GNU Make (or Pymake on Windows) to build the tree.</p>
<p>As I outlined in <a href="/blog/2012/06/25/improving-mozilla's-build-system/">Improving Mozilla's Build System</a>,
<em>Makefile.in</em> are suboptimal for a number of reasons. The important
bit is they essentially tie us to the use of make (recursive or otherwise).
We are very interested in supporting modern build systems such as Tup
(the theory being they will build the tree faster).</p>
<p>Enter <em>moz.build</em> files. Storing our build configuration in
<em>moz.build</em> files allows us to decouple the definition of the build
system from the tool used to build it.</p>
<h2>How moz.build Files Work</h2>
<p>At the tail end of <em>configure</em>, the build system invokes the
<em>config.status</em> script in the object directory. The role of
<em>config.status</em> is to combine the information collected during
<em>configure</em> with the build configuration obtained from <em>moz.build</em> files
and take the necessary actions to ensure the build backend (make) can
build the tree.</p>
<p>Before today, <em>config.status</em> essentially iterated over the source tree
and converted <em>Makefile.in</em> files to <em>Makefile</em> in the object directory.
Things are now slightly more complicated with <em>moz.build</em> files.</p>
<p>When <em>config.status</em> runs, it starts with the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/87de54667483/moz.build">root moz.build</a>
from the source tree. It feeds this file into a Python interpreter. It
then looks for special variables like <em>DIRS</em> and <em>PARALLEL_DIRS</em> to determine
which directories contain additional <em>moz.build</em> files. It then descends
into all the referenced directories, reading their <em>moz.build</em> files.
While this is happening, we are converting the results of each
<em>moz.build</em> file execution into <em>backend.mk</em> files that make knows how
to build. It also performs the <em>Makefile.in</em> to <em>Makefile</em> conversion
like it always has. When the whole process has finished, the object
directory contains a bunch of <em>Makefile</em> and <em>backend.mk</em> files. make
runs like it always has. The only real difference is some variables are
coming from the <em>moz.build</em>-derived <em>backend.mk</em> files instead of
<em>Makefile</em>.</p>
<p>This is just a brief overview, of course. If you want to know more,
see the code in <em>/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend</em> and
<em>/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/backend</em>.</p>
<h2>Build System Future</h2>
<p>With the introduction of <em>moz.build</em> files, the intent is to <strong>eventually
completely eliminate Makefile.in and have all the build definition live
in moz.build files.</strong></p>
<p>Doing this all at once would have been next to impossible. So, we
decided to eliminate <em>Makefile.in</em> gradually. The first step is what
landed today: essentially moving <em>DIRS</em> variables out of <em>Makefile.in</em>
and into <em>moz.build</em> files. Next, we will be eliminating empty
<em>Makefile.in</em> (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844635">bug 844635</a>)
and will be moving more parts of the build definition from <em>Makefile.in</em>
to <em>moz.build</em> files. The next part to move over will likely be IDLs
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=818246">bug 818246</a>).
After that, it may be exported files (<em>EXPORTS</em> in <em>Makefile.in</em>
parlance). And repeat until we have no more <em>Makefile.in</em> in the tree.</p>
<p>Each migration of build definition data to <em>moz.build</em> files will likely
occur in two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>A largely mechanical move of the variables from <em>Makefile.in</em> to
   <em>moz.build</em>.</li>
<li>Better build backend integration resulting from the move.</li>
</ol>
<p>In phase #1, we will essentially cut and paste variable assignments to
<em>moz.build</em> files. make will read the same variables it does today and
perform the same actions. The only difference is the values in these
variables will be defined in <em>moz.build</em> files.</p>
<p>In phase #2, we will leverage the fact that our build definition now has
an API. We will change our existing make backend to be more efficient.
For example, we should soon be able to compile IDLs and copy exported
headers without make traversing through the directory tree at build time.
We will be able to do this because the <em>moz.build</em> traversal at
pre-build time sees data from all <em>moz.build</em> files and with this
<em>complete world view</em> is able to produce more optimal make files than
what you would get if you recursed into multiple directories. In short:
it will make the build faster.</p>
<p>Once we have a sufficient portion of the build definition moved to
<em>moz.build</em> files we will be able to experiment with new build backends
(like Tup), look into automatic Visual Studio project generation, and
more easily experiment with different ways of building (such as
precompiled headers, fewer compiler process invocations, etc). These
should all contribute to faster build times.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>What impact will I see from this change?</h4>
<p>If you never touched <em>Makefile.in</em> files in the tree, you should not
notice anything different about how the tree builds or how the build
system works. You should have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The most obvious changes to the source tree are:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a <em>moz.build</em> file in almost every directory now.</li>
<li>The variables related to directory traversal (those containing <em>DIRS</em>
   in their name) are now defined in <em>moz.build</em> files instead of
   <em>Makefile.in</em>.</li>
<li>If your <em>Makefile.in</em> contains a variable that has been moved to
   <em>moz.build</em> files, make will spew an error when processing that file
   and the build will fail.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Will this change how I build?</h4>
<p>It shouldn't. You should build the tree just like you always have. Most
of you won't notice any differences.</p>
<p>If you see something weird, speak up in #build or file a bug if you are
really confident it is wrong.</p>
<h4>What are the risks to this change?</h4>
<p>The migration of variables from <em>Makefile.in</em> to <em>moz.build</em> files is
largely mechanical and significant portions are done manually. This can
be a mind-numbing and tedious process. Not helping things is the fact
that Splinter's review interface for these kinds of patches is hard to
read.</p>
<p>This all means that there is a non-trivial risk for <em>transcription</em>
errors. All it takes is an inverted conditional block and all of a
sudden large parts of the tree are no longer built, for example.</p>
<p>We have established <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=846425">bug 846825</a>
to investigate any oddities from the initial transfer. Developers are
encouraged to help with the effort. Please spot check that your
directories are still being built, tests run, etc. Pay special attention
to changes made in the last 4 months as these parts of <em>Makefile.in</em>
would have been bit rotted and more prone to data loss.</p>
<p>Parts of the tree not enabled in standard configurations are more prone
to breakage due to less testing. i.e. build configurations not captured
by TBPL have a higher chance of breaking.</p>
<h4>Will this make the tree build faster?</h4>
<p>Not yet. But eventually it will. This initial landing paves the
groundwork to making the tree build faster (see the <em>Future</em> section
above).</p>
<h4>I see a lot of empty moz.build files!</h4>
<p>Yes. Sorry about that. The good news is they shouldn't be empty for
long. As things move from <em>Makefile.in</em> to <em>moz.build</em> we'll see fewer
and fewer empty <em>moz.build</em> files. We'll also see fewer and fewer
<em>Makefile.in</em> files once we start deleting empty <em>Makefile.in</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to know why we must have empty files, it's mainly for
validation. If we allowed <em>moz.build</em> files to be optional, how would
you detect a typo in a directory name? Directory exists? What if that
directory exists but isn't supposed to have a <em>moz.build</em> file?</p>
<h4>You bitrotted my patches!</h4>
<p>Yes. I'm sorry. The transition period to <em>moz.build</em> files could be a
little messy. There will be lots of changes to <em>Makefile.in</em> and
<em>moz.build</em> files and lots of chances for bit rot. Uplifts could be
especially nasty. (Although I don't believe many uplifts involve
significant changes to the build configuration.)</p>
<p>This all means there is a strong incentive for us to complete the
transition as quickly as possible.</p>
<h4>Can I help with the transition to moz.build files?</h4>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>The transition is largely mechanical (at least phase #1). If you are
interested in moving a variable or set of variables, hop in #build on
IRC and speak up!</p>
<h4>You said moz.build files are actually Python files?!</h4>
<p>Yes they are! However, they are executed in a very tightly controlled
sandbox. You can't import modules, open files, etc. UPPERCASE variable
names are reserved and only a few functions are exposed. If you attempt
to assign to an unknown UPPERCASE variable or assign an invalid value,
an error will occur. This is already much better than Makefile because
we can now detect errors earlier in the build process (rather than 15
minutes into a build).</p>
<h4>What variables and functions are available in moz.build files?</h4>
<p>If you run |./mach mozbuild-reference| you will see a print-out of
all the variables, functions, and symbols that are exposed to the Python
sandbox that moz.build files execute in. There are even tests that will
fail the build if the sandbox contains symbols not in this output!</p>
<p>The output should be valid reSTructuredText (in case you want to convert
to HTML for reading in your browser).</p>
<h4>What if a moz.build file contains an error?</h4>
<p>The build will break.</p>
<p>A lot of work has gone into making the output of moz.build errors human
friendly and actionable. If you do something wrong, it won't just
complain: it will tell you how to fix it!</p>
<h4>Besides build times, how else will this improve the build system?</h4>
<p>There are several ways!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, moz.build are more strict about what data is allowed
to be defined. If you assign to an UPPERCASE variable, that variable
must be known to the sandbox or else the assignment will error. This
means that if you assign to an UPPERCASE variable, you know it has a
side-effect. No more cargo culting of old, meaningless variables!</p>
<p>To change the behavior of moz.build files (add new variables or
functions, change how makefile generation works, etc) will require
changes to the code in /python/mozbuild. This code belongs squarely to
the build module and requires appropriate review. A problem with
Makefiles is that they have lots of foot guns by default and its easy
for self-inflicted wounds to land in the tree without explicit build
peer review. This problem largely goes away with moz.build files because
the sandbox takes away all of make's foot guns.</p>
<p>The output of a moz.build execution is essentially a static data
structure. It's easy to validate them for conformance. If we discover
bad practices in our build definition, we can centrally add tests for
them and enforce best practices.</p>
<p>We will also see user experience wins by moving data to moz.build files.
Take mochitests for an example. We currently have several flavors
(plain, browser, chrome, etc). Sometimes you cannot distinguish the
flavor by the filename alone. With moz.build files, it will be easier to
answer questions like "what mochitest flavor is this file?" mach could
hook into this so you can type |mach mochitest path/to/file.html|
instead of |mach mochitest-plain path/to/file.html|. Even better, you
should just be able to type |mach path/to/test.html| and mach knows from
the build definition that path/to/test.html is a plain mochitest file
and assumes you want to run it. There are dozens of small development
workflow wins to be gained here!</p>
<h4>If I change a moz.build file, what happens?</h4>
<p>If you change a moz.build file, then make should detect that it
has changed and it will update the dynamically generated <em>backend.mk</em>
file and reinvoke the requested build action. This should all happen
automatically (just like <em>Makefile.in</em> to <em>Makefile</em> conversion works
automatically).</p>
<h4>My build seems to pause for a few seconds before starting!</h4>
<p>A change to <em>any</em> moz.build file will cause a full traversal of the
entire moz.build tree. On modern machines, this should only take 1-3
seconds. If your source tree is not in the page cache (and you need
to load moz.build files from disk) or if you are on older hardware, this
could be a little slower.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate side-effect of having a whole world view of the
build definition. The build delay incurred by these full scans should
eventually be cancelled out by build backend optimizations resulting
from having this whole world view, however.</p>
<p>The good news is this full scan should only occur if a mozbuild file
changes. And, if you are performing make recursion, it should only
happen once (not in every directory). If you notice multiple moz.build
scanning-related pauses during builds, please file a bug in Core ::
Build Config!</p>
<p>Finally, we are performing the reads on a single thread currently. We
can throw more cores at the task if someone codes up a patch.</p>
<h4>What happened to allmakefiles.sh?</h4>
<p>It has been sacked. allmakefiles.sh was an optimization to perform all
the Makefile.in to Makefile conversion in one go. The directory
traversal performed by moz.build reading effectively replaces the role
of allmakefiles.sh. Not only that, but the moz.build build definition is
always up to date! allmakefiles.sh was typically out of sync with
reality and was a burden to maintain.</p>
<h4>Did we just invent our own build system?</h4>
<p>Kinda. We invented a generic Python sandboxing infrastructure. Then we
hooked up code to populate it with variables from our build system and
told it how to perform file traversal by reading specific variables set
during file execution. Then we hooked up code for taking the evaluated
results of all those sandboxes and convert them into make files.</p>
<p>Conceptually, what we invented is like GYP but with a different config
file format. We have dabbled with the idea of converting the parsed
build definition into GYP classes and then leveraging GYP to produce
Makefiles, Ninja files, Visual Studio Projects, etc. This would an
interesting experiment!</p>
<p>If you want to call it a build system, call it a build system. However,
it is currently tightly coupled to Mozilla's needs, so you can't just
use it anywhere. The concept might be worth exploring, however.</p>
<h4>Is there anything else you'd like to share?</h4>
<p>I think we set the record for most parts in a bug: 61. Although, they
are numbered 1-17, 19-20. Part 18 has 30+ sub-parts using letters from
the English and Greek alphabet for identifiers. Part 61 uses the
infinity symbol as its number. See the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?changeset=c65d59d33aa8">pushlog</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who helped with this effort. The bug
itself was <em>only</em> 6 months old and had active development off and on for
a lot of it. Ted Mielczarek and Mike Hommey provided invaluable feedback
on the core build system patches. A number of module owners stepped in
to lend eyes to the mechanical conversion of their files. Last but not
least, Ms2ger provided invaluable review aid on many of the patches. The
work was so good that we all agreed that an Ms2ger f+ was good enough
for a build peer rs! If reviewing the patches wasn't enough, Ms2ger
also oversaw the tree closure and merging of the landing. I don't know
how I will repay this debt.</p>
<h4>Any more questions?</h4>
<p>If you have more questions, drop in #build on irc.mozilla.org and ask
away.</p>

  <small>December 06, 2012 at 09:55 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>, <a href='/blog/category/logging'>logging</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <h2>Forward</h2>
<p>For reasons I can't explain, I have a keen interest in computer logging
systems. Perhaps it stems from my frustration that such a
seemingly trivial task can often be quite complicated. Perhaps it's from
the scaling challenges inherent with inevitably needing to analyze
terabytes of logged data. Perhaps it's from my experience designing
highly-available distributed server application and needing to use
logging for real-time monitoring and decision making. Whatever the
root causes, I've always wanted to create a brain dump of my thoughts
on logging. So, here we go!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Logging. Practically every computer program does it in some form or
another. The standard libraries for many programming languages provide
a logging facility. But, have you ever stopped to think about the side
effects of logging or why you log the way you do?</p>
<p>In this first post, I will briefly define what I consider logging and
will talk about something called <em>structured logging</em>.</p>
<h2>The Definition of Logging</h2>
<p>For the scope of these posts, I will define logging to be:</p>
<pre><code>An emitted stream of distinct messages from a running application
</code></pre>
<p>A <em>message</em> can be pretty much anything. They are often strings. But,
they could be binary data. The transport mechanism is undefined.
Although, most logging systems typically write to a file (eventually).</p>
<p>I should also call out the difference between <em>reading</em>/<em>interpreting</em>
logs and <em>transporting</em> them. When I say <em>reading a log</em>, I'm referring
to a process where an entity (either human or machine) <em>reads</em> the
individual message content and infers something from it. By contrast, a
<em>transporter</em> treats messages as a black box and just shuffles bits
around. <em>Transporters</em> also typically send or store logging messages
somewhere.</p>
<p>It's worth explicitly noting that this definition encompasses both
tradtional <em>print()</em> based logging (writing a line to a file or output)
as well as things like transaction logs or recording events as new rows
in a database.</p>
<h2>The Multiple Use Cases of Logging</h2>
<p>Before I get to some of the interesting aspects of logging, let's
identify <em>some</em> of the use cases of logging (in no particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording application errors (e.g. exceptions and stack traces)</li>
<li>Low-level information to aid in debugging or human observation</li>
<li>Application monitoring (includes metrics and alerting)</li>
<li>Business analytics (use the logged data to help make decisions)</li>
<li>Security auditing</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's move on to the crux of
this post.</p>
<h2>Logging for Humans or Machines</h2>
<p>I would argue that every log message is intended to be <em>interpreted</em>
by either a human or a machine.</p>
<p>If a log message is only going to be used to help a human debug a system
or casually see what's going on, it's intended for humans. If a log
message is going to be used for machine analysis later (e.g. monitoring,
alerting, business analytics, security auditing, etc), it's intended for
machines.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction. If it isn't clear, please re-read the
prior paragraphs. Now might also be a good time for you to audit the
logs in your life and assign <em>human</em> or <em>machine</em> labels to them.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p><strong>The problem with logging as most of us know it is that it is optimized
for human consumption, even if machines are the intended consumer.</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of most logging systems we log a string, a char *, an
array of characters that can easily be read by humans. For example, a
simple web application might produce log files containing lines like:</p>
<pre><code>2012:11:24T17:32:23.3435 INFO gps@mozilla.com successfully logged in
</code></pre>
<p>Human readability is a great feature to have. However, it comes at a
price: more difficult machine consumption.</p>
<p><strong>By optimizing for human consumption, we've introduced a new problem:
log parsing.</strong></p>
<p>In the above example log message, what the program has done is combined
a few distinct fields of data (an event - <em>logged in</em>, the
username, and the time) into a single text string. This is great for
humans glancing at a log file. But that decision now necessitates
downstream machine consumers to <em>parse</em>/<em>decode</em> that text back into its
original, distinct fields.</p>
<p>I call this style of logging <em>destructured</em> or <em>unstructured</em> logging. We
start with distinct fields of data and then <em>destructure</em> them into a
fully free-form or semi-formed text. By doing so, we lose part
of the original data structure and necessitate the need to reconstruct
it (via parsing).</p>
<p>This seems silly to me.</p>
<p>Why are we formatting distinct fields of data into unified strings only
to have them parsed into their original components again? If lossless
and simple round-trip encoding/decoding is your goal, there are much
better ways than freely-formed text! Going <em>to</em> text is easy
(<em>printf()</em> or string concatenation are how it is commonly performed).
Getting back to the original representation is the real problem.</p>
<p>Every persisted log message destined for machines will need to be decoded
to some degree to facilitate analysis. However, by using destructured
text, nearly every program and logging system forces this decoding
problem onto its users by using an encoding that is difficult to code.</p>
<p>Every time you are analyzing a log file containing destructured text you
need to solve the parsing/decoding problem. Every time you write an
<em>awk</em>, <em>grep</em>, <em>sed</em>, <em>perl</em>, etc script, use regular expressions, etc
to scrape logs you are solving this problem. <strong>How much time do you
spend decoding/parsing logs versus actually doing something useful with
the data?</strong> From my personal experience, a lot. And, parsing
destructured text is a very fragile solution. What happens when the
string changes, even by just a little? Does that throw off your
decoder/parser?</p>
<p>Decoding log messages is a hard problem. Furthermore, it's a problem I'd
rather not have.</p>
<h2>Structured Logging to the Rescue</h2>
<p><img alt="What if I told you there's a better way to log" src="/images/morpheus_logging.jpg" /></p>
<p>One of my early professional mentors taught me that one of the best ways
to solve a problem is to change the requirements so that the problem no
longer exists or becomes easier to solve. (If that didn't immediately
click with you, you might want to read it again because I feel it's an
invaluable skill and one that many engineers don't employ).
Applying that lesson here, how do we eliminate the problem of
parsing destructured textual data back into its original fields?  Simple:
we don't emit destructured text! Instead, we emit data that is easily
machine readable, where each individual field is preserved. <strong>This is
called structured logging.</strong></p>
<p>The primary benefit of structured logging is that you eliminate the
parsing problem (or at least you change it to be a solved problem by
using a common or well-defined encoding format). No tedious searching
for data within free-form text and extracting it. Instead, the fields
from the event-producing application are seamlessly preserved and
loaded into downstream machine consumers.</p>
<h3>A Closer Look</h3>
<p>What does structured logging look like? Well, it depends. There is no
standard for structured logging. When I first started writing this post
in June 2011, a Google search for <em>structured logging</em> didn't yield
much. Today, things aren't that much better. Although, there has been
significant activity in the last 15 months. rsyslog has launched
<a href="http://blog.gerhards.net/2012/02/announcing-project-lumberjack.html">project Lumberjack</a>,
which has structured logging as a pillar. There is even someone sitting
10 ft from me at Mozilla's SF office doing structured logging for server
applications (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Metlog">metlog</a>).</p>
<p>All structured logging systems are different. But, the concepts
are mostly the same.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a log-producing application, a function call to
produce an unstructured message may look something like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot; successfully logged in&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Whereas a call to produce that same message in structured form may look
like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;successful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">who</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You'll immediately notice that the API retains the original pieces of
data. In this example, we just have the event name (<em>successful_login</em>)
and <em>who</em> (some variable value).</p>
<p>This will look different in every programming language, of course. And,
depending on the structured logging mechanism, the common metadata
produced with each message (e.g. time and log level) may differ. But the
general idea is you preserve the rich data fields as they cross over
into the logging facility rather than <em>casting</em> them to a string.
Behind the scenes, the structured logger retains the fields (the
original structure) and encodes them into something machine readable.</p>
<p>Put another way, structured loggers log objects, not strings.</p>
<p>How objects are encoded again depends on the structured logger
implementation. JSON is a well-understood encoding format. An example
JSON encoding of our example message might look like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">1354317157.034534</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;INFO&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sucessful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;who&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;gps@mozilla.com&quot;</span><span class="p">}]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That's an array of current time, log level, event name/message type, and
a mapping of the data fields.</p>
<p>Or, you could opt for a more efficient encoding format, such as
protocol buffers (which is binary).</p>
<p>The actual encoding theoretically doesn't really matter as long as it can
easily be decoded back into its original data. A good way to identify this
trait is whether you need to implement a decoder/parser more than once
per programming language or if you need to apply different decoding
mechanisms based on the content of a message. If you do, you probably
don't have a generic enough encoding format.</p>
<p>Going back to implementation details, what about a consumer? In
JavaScript, our JSON structured logger from above might look something
like:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">line</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">time</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">level</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">action</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fields</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;successful_login&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">who</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fields</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">who</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c1">// Do something interesting.</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;XXX&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this with a destructured parser:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">line</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">endsWith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;successfully logged in&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Find username.</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">spaceIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; &quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">spaceIndex</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// Do something interesting.</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">line</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(...))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">//</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This example admittedly isn't very complex. But, you can already see
some differences. Notably, it takes 1 line to completely parse <em>any</em>
message using the structured logger. The unstructured text parser
requires multiple lines of code <em>per message type</em>. One of those scales
better than the other.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, it's worth mentioning something about event
names/enumerations. You may notice I gave <em>event name</em> a dedicated
field in my example. This is intentional. In a subsequent post,
I will talk about the importance of event names/enumerations and
schemas. Until then, just assume that having a unique event name is
an important aspect of a well-designed structured logging system.
Hence its inclusion in my examples above.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the vast majority of application logging is done suboptimally
because it forces a <strong>hard</strong> problem of decoding/parsing onto consumers.
Given that many logs are intended for machines, I think this is a
problem that shouldn't need to exist and the software industry should
rethink its current approach to logging by offering first-class
structured logging facilities and subsequently encouraging their use.</p>
<p>If application logging retained the data behind messages, the problem
of parsing/decoding log messages would largely vanish and we would be
left with the real problem: actually doing something useful with
logged data. That is the point of logging after all, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now, this may sound like I'm waiving my hands a bit. You are right:
structured logging by itself is no silver bullet. There are many ways to
do it suboptimally and to use it when you shouldn't. In subsequent posts
to this series, I will dive deeper into how to properly design a
(structured) logging system. I will also investigate some of the
performance implications associated with different logging mechanisms.
Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>If you use mach to build Firefox, there is a chance you may run into
some errors from a change that landed on mozilla-central Wednesday.</p>
<p>I reimplemented the mozconfig finding and loading logic in Python and
with a nice shell wrapper that lets us more easily inspect side-effects
of execution. The overall goal is to speed up mozconfig loading (fewer
shell invocations) as well as to have a strong API for interacting with
mozconfigs so we can do things like better validation. As a side effect,
we now have test coverage of mozconfig behavior!</p>
<p>Anyway, because the logic for mozconfig finding and loading is going
through a completely new mechanism, you may notice some weird behavior.
Until a few minutes ago, $topsrcdir wasn't defined in the execution
environment. This is now fixed. I think most complaints stemmed from
this.</p>
<p>Another significant change is that mozconfig shell scripts are now
executed in a shell that has <em>set -e</em>. This means that failing commands
in your mozconfig will now abort execution. Before, execution would have
silently continued unless you checked the exit code in your mozconfig.
I think this is a change for the better, but it may break your
mozconfigs.</p>
<p>If you encounter an issue, please follow the instructions in mach's
output to file a bug. Please attach or link to your mozconfig.</p>
