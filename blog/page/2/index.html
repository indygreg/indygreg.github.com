  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I've written an extensive testing <em>framework</em> for Mozilla's
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/">version control tools</a>.
Despite it being a little rough around the edges, I'm a bit proud of it.</p>
<p>When you run tests for MozReview, Mozilla's heavily modified
<a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a> code review tool, the
following things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A MySQL server is started in a Docker container.</li>
<li>A Bugzilla server (running the same code as
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>) is started on
  an Apache httpd server with mod_perl inside a Docker container.</li>
<li>A RabbitMQ server mimicking
  <a href="https://pulse.mozilla.org/">pulse.mozilla.org</a> is started in a Docker
  container.</li>
<li>A Review Board Django development server is started.</li>
<li>A Mercurial HTTP server is started</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, we'll likely also need to add support for various other
services to support MozReview and other components of version control
tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Autoland HTTP service will be started in a Docker container, along
  with any other requirements it may have.</li>
<li>An IRC server will be started in a Docker container.</li>
<li>Zookeeper and Kafka will be started on multiple Docker containers</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire setup is pretty cool. You have actual services running on
your local machine. Mike Conley and Steven MacLeod even did some pair
coding of MozReview while on a plane last week. I think it's pretty cool
this is even possible.</p>
<p>There is very little mocking in the tests. If we need an external
service, we try to spin up an instance inside a local container.
This way, we can't have unexpected test successes or failures due to
bugs in mocking. We have very high confidence that if something works
against local containers, it will work in production.</p>
<p>I currently have each test file owning its own set of Docker
containers and processes. This way, we get full test isolation and can
run tests concurrently without race conditions. This drastically reduces
overall test execution time and makes individual tests easier to reason
about.</p>
<p>As cool as the test setup is, there's a bunch I wish were better.</p>
<p>Spinning up and shutting down all those containers and processes takes a
lot of time. We're currently sitting around 8s startup time and 2s
shutdown time. 10s overhead per test is unacceptable. When I make a one
line change, I want the tests to be instantenous. 10s is too long for
me to sit idly by. Unfortunately, I've already gone to great pains to
make test overhead as short as possible.
<a href="http://www.fig.sh/">Fig</a> wasn't good enough for me for various reasons.
I've reimplemented my own orchestration directly on top of the
<a href="https://docker-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">docker-py package</a> to
achieve some significant performance wins. Using
<a href="http://pythonhosted.org//futures/">concurrent.futures</a> to perform
operations against multiple containers concurrently was a big win.
<em>Bootstrapping</em> containers (running their first-run entrypoint scripts
and committing the result to be used later by tests) was a bigger win
(first run of Bugzilla is 20-25 seconds).</p>
<p>I'm at the point of optimizing startup where the longest pole is the
initialization of the services inside Docker containers themselves.
MySQL takes a few seconds to start accepting connections. Apache +
Bugzilla has a semi-involved initialization process. RabbitMQ takes
about 4 seconds to initialize. There are some cascading dependencies in
there, so the majority of startup time is waiting for processes to
finish their startup routine.</p>
<p>Another concern with running all these containers is memory usage. When
you start running 6+ instances of MySQL + Apache, RabbitMQ, + ..., it
becomes really easy to exhaust system memory, incur swapping, and have
performance fall off a cliff. I've spent a non-trivial amount of time
figuring out the minimal amount of memory I can make services consume
while still not sacrificing too much performance.</p>
<p>It is quite an experience having the problem of trying to minimize
resource usage and startup time for various applications. Searching the
internet will happily give you recommended settings for applications.
You can find out how to make a service start in 10s instead of 60s or
consume 100 MB of RSS instead of 1 GB. But what the internet won't tell
you is how to make the service start in 2s instead of 3s or consume as
little memory as possible. I reckon I'm past the point of diminishing
returns where most people don't care about any further performance wins.
But, because of how I'm using containers for end-to-end testing and I
have a surplus of short-lived containers, it is clearly I problem I need
to solve.</p>
<p>I might be able to squeeze out a few more seconds of reduction by
further optimizing startup and shutdown. But, I doubt I'll reduce things
below 5s. If you ask me, that's still not good enough. I want no more
than 2s overhead per test. And I don't think I'm going to get that
unless I start utilizing containers across multiple tests. And I really
don't want to do that because it sacrifices test purity. Engineering is
full of trade-offs.</p>
<p>Another takeaway from implementing this test harness is that the
pre-built Docker images available from the Docker Registry almost always
become useless. I eventually make a customization that can't be
shoehorned into the readily-available image and I find myself having
to reinvent the wheel. I'm not a fan of the <em>download and run a binary</em>
model, especially given Docker's less-than-stellar history on the
security and cryptography fronts (I'll trust Linux distributions to get
package distribution right, but I'm not going to be trusting the Docker
Registry quite yet), so it's not a huge loss. I'm at the point where
I've lost faith in Docker Registry images and my default position is to
implement my own builder. Containers are supposed to do one thing, so
it usually isn't that difficult to roll my own images.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about Docker and containerized test execution. But
I feel like I'm foraging into new territory and solving problems
like startup time minimization that I shouldn't really have to be
solving. I think I can justify it given the increased accuracy from the
tests and the increased confidence that brings. I just wish the cost
weren't so high. Hopefully as others start leaning on containers and
Docker more for test execution, people start figuring out how to make
some of these problems disappear.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> has played a major role in the
Firefox development process for over 15 years. <strong>With upcoming changes
to how code changes to Firefox are submitted and reviewed, I think it is
time to revisit the central role of Bugzilla and bugs in the Firefox
development process.</strong> I know this is a contentious thing to say. Please,
gather your breath, and calmly read on as I explain why I believe this.</p>
<p>The current Firefox change process defaults to requiring a Bugzilla bug
for everything. It is rare (and from my experience frowned upon) when a
commit to Firefox doesn't reference a bug number. We've essentially made
Bugzilla and a bug prerequisites for changing anything in the Firefox
version control repository. For the remainder of this post, I'm going to
say that we <em>require</em> a bug for any change, even though that statement
isn't technically accurate. Also, when I say <em>Bugzilla</em>, I mean
<em>bugzilla.mozilla.org</em>, not the generic project.</p>
<p>Before I go on, let's boil the Firefox change process down to basics.</p>
<p>At the heart of any change to the Firefox source repository is a diff.
The diff (a representation of the differences between a set of files)
is the smallest piece of data necessary to represent a change to the
Firefox code. I argue that anything more than the vanilla diff is
overhead and could contribute to
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">process debt</a>.
Now, there is some essential overhead. Version control tools supplement
diffs with metadata, such as the author, commit message, and date. Mozilla
has also instituted a near-mandatory code review policy, where changes
need to be signed off by a set of trusted individuals. I view both of
these additions to the vanilla diff as essential for Firefox development
and non-negotiable. Therefore, the bare minimum requirements for changing
Firefox code are a diff plus metadata (a commit/patch) and (almost
always) a review/sign-off. That's it. Notably absent from this list is a
Bugzilla bug. <strong>I argue that a bug is not strictly required to
change Firefox.</strong> Instead, we've instituted a near-universal policy
that we should have bugs. We've <strong>chosen</strong> to add overhead and process
debt - interaction with Bugzilla - to our Firefox change process.</p>
<p>Now, this choice to require all changes be associated with bugs has its
merits. Bugs provide excellent anchor points for historical context and
for additional information after the change has been committed and is
forever set in stone in the repository (commits are immutable in
Mercurial and Git and you can't easily attach metadata to the commit
after the fact). Bugs are great to track relationships between different
problems or units of work. Bugs can even be used to track progress
towards a large feature. Bugzilla components also provide a decent
mechanism to follow related activity. There's also a lot of tooling and
familiar process standing on top of the Bugzilla <em>platform</em>. There's a
lot to love here and I don't want diminish the importance of all these
things.</p>
<p><strong>When I look to the future, I see a world where the current, central
role of Bugzilla and bugs as part of the Firefox change process begin to
wane.</strong> I see a world where the benefits to maintaining our current
Bugzilla-centric workflow start to erode and the cost of maintaining
it becomes higher and harder to justify. You actually don't have to look
too far into the future: that world is already here and I've already
started to feel the pains of it.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I blogged about
<a href="/blog/2015/01/10/code-first-and-the-rise-of-the-dvcs-and-github/">GitHub and its code first approach to change</a>.
That post was spun off from an early draft of this post (as were the
posts about <a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">Firefox contribution debt</a>
and <a href="/blog/2015/01/12/utilizing-github-for-firefox-development/">utilizing GitHub for Firefox development</a>).
I wanted to introduce the concept of <em>code first</em> because it is
central to my justification for changing how we do things. In summary,
<strong>code first capitalizes on the fact that any change to software
involves code and therefore puts code front and center in the change
process.</strong> (In hindsight, I probably should have used the term <em>code
centric</em>, because that's how I want people to think about things.) So
how does <em>code first</em> relate to Bugzilla and Firefox development?</p>
<p>Historically, code review has occurred in Bugzilla: upload a patch to
Bugzilla, ask for review, and someone will look at it. And, since
practically every change to Firefox requires review, you need a bug in
Bugzilla to contain that review. Thus, <strong>one way to view a bug is as a
vehicle for code review</strong>. Not every bug is <em>just</em> a code review, of
course. But a good number of them are.</p>
<p>The only constant is change. And <strong>the way Mozilla conducts code review
for changes to Firefox (and other projects) is changing</strong>. We now have
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview.html">MozReview</a>,
a code review tool that is <em>not Bugzilla</em>. If we start accepting GitHub
pull requests, we <em>may</em> perform reviews exclusively on GitHub, another
tool that is <em>not Bugzilla</em>.</p>
<p>(Before I go on, I want to quickly point out that MozReview is nowhere
close to its final form. Parts of MozReview are pretty bad right now.
The maintainers all know this and we have plans to fix it. We'll be in
Toronto all of next week working on it. If you don't think you'll ever
use it because parts are bad today, I ask you to withhold judgement for
a few more months.)</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, the question on whether Bugzilla should
always be used for code review for Firefox has been answered and that
answer is <em>no</em>. People, including maintainers of Bugzilla, realized
that better-than-Splinter/Bugzilla code review tools exist and that
continuing to invest time to develop Bugzilla/Splinter into a
best-in-class code review tool would be better spent <em>integrating</em>
Bugzilla with an existing tool. This is why we now have a
<a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a> based code review tool -
MozReview - integrated with Bugzilla. If you care about code quality and
more powerful workflows, you should be rejoicing at this because
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">the implementation of code review in Bugzilla does not maximize optimal outcomes</a>.</p>
<p>The world we're moving to is one where code review occurs outside of
Bugzilla. This raises an important question: <strong>if Bugzilla was being used
primarily as a vehicle for code review, what benefit and/or role should
Bugzilla play when code review is conducted outside of Bugzilla?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I posit that there are a class of bugs that won't need to exist
going forward because bugs will provide little to no value.</strong> Put
another way, I believe that a growing number of commits to the Firefox
repository won't reference bugs.</p>
<p>Come with me on a journey to the future.</p>
<p>MozReview is purposefully being designed in a code and repository
centric way. To initiate the formal process for considering a change to
code, you push to a Mercurial (or Git!) repository. This could be
directly to Mozilla's review repository. If I have my way, this could
even be kicked off by submitting a pull request on GitHub or Bitbucket.
No Bugzilla attachment uploading here: our systems talk in terms of
repositories and commits. Again, this is by design: we don't want
submitting code to Mozilla to be any harder than <em>hg push</em> or <em>git
push</em> so as to not introduce <em>process debt</em>. If you have code, you'll be
able to send it to us.</p>
<p>In the near future, MozReview will stop cross-posting detailed review
updates to Bugzilla. Instead, we'll use Review Board's e-mail feature
to send its flavor of emails. These will have rich HTML content (or
plain text if you insist) and will provide a better experience
than Bugzilla ever will. We'll adopt the model of tools like
Phabricator and GitHub and only post summaries or links of activity,
not full content, to bugs. You may be familiar with the concept as
applied to the web: it's called hyperlinking.</p>
<p>Work is being invested into Autoland. Autoland is an automated landing
queue that pushes/lands commits semi-automatically once they are ready
(have review, pass automation, etc). Think of Autoland as a bot that
does all the labor intensive and menial actions around pushing that
you do now. I believe Autoland will eventually handle near 100% of
pushes to the Firefox repository. And, if I have my way, Autoland will
result in the abolishment of <em>integration branches</em> and merge commits in
the Firefox repository. Good riddance.</p>
<p>MozReview and Autoland will be highly integrated. MozReview will be the
primary user interface for interacting with Autoland. (Some of this
should be in place by the end of the quarter.)</p>
<p>In this world, MozReview and its underlying version control repositories
essentially become a <em>database</em> of all submitted, pending, and discarded
commits to Firefox. The metaphorical <em>primary keys</em> of this <em>database</em>
are not bug numbers: they are code/commits. (Code first!) Some of the
flags stored in this <em>database</em> tell Autoland what it should do. And the
MozReview user interface (and API) provide a mechanism into controlling
those flags.</p>
<p>Landing a change in Firefox will be initiated by a simple action such as
clicking a checkbox in MozReview. (That could even be the <em>Grant Review</em>
checkbox.) Commits cleared for landing will be picked up by
Autoland and eventually automatically pushed to the Firefox repository
(assuming the build and test automation is happy, of course). Once
Autoland takes control, humans are just passengers. We won't be bothered
with menial tasks like updating the commit message to reflect a review
was performed: this will happen automatically inside MozReview or
Autoland. (Although, there's a chance we may adopt some PGP-based
signing to more strongly convey review for some code changes in order to
facilitate stronger auditing and trust guarantees. Stay tuned.)
Likewise, if a commit becomes associated with a bug, we can add that
metadata to the commit before it is landed, no human involvement
necessary beyond specifying the link in the MozReview web UI (or API).
Autoland/MozReview will close review requests and/or bugs automatically.
(Are you excited about performing less work yet?)</p>
<p>When commits are added to MozReview, <strong>MozReview will read metadata from
the repository they came from to automatically determine an appropriate
reviewer</strong>. (We <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/iXr70VgapWk/GkTCcKRjNi8J">plan</a>
to leverage moz.build files for this in the case of Firefox.) This
should eliminate a lot of <em>process debt</em> around choosing a reviewer.
<strong>Similar metadata will also be used to determine what Bugzilla component
a change is related to, static analysis rules to use to critique the
phsyical structure of the change, and even automation jobs that should
be executed given the set of files that changed.</strong> The use of this
metadata will erode significant <em>process debt</em> around the change
contribution workflow.</p>
<p>As commits are pushed into MozReview/Autoland, the systems will be
intelligent about automatically tracking dependencies and facilitating
complex development workflows that people run into on a daily basis.</p>
<p>If I create a commit on top of someone else's commit that hasn't been
checked in yet, MozReview will detect the dependency between
my changes and the parent ones. This is an advantage of being code
first: by interfacing with repositories rather than patch files, you
have an explicit dependency graph embedded in the repository commit DAG
that can be used to aid machines in their activities.</p>
<p>It will also be possible to partially land a series of commits. If I get
review on the first 5 of 10 commits but things stall on commit 6, I can ask
Autoland to land the already-reviewed commits so they don't get bit
rotted and so you have partial progress (psychological studies show that
a partial reward for work results in greater happiness through a sense
of accomplishment).</p>
<p>Since initiating actions in MozReview is light weight (just <em>hg push</em>),
itch scratching is encouraged. I don't know about you, but in the course
of working on the Firefox code base, I frequently find myself wanting to
make small, 15-30s changes to fix something really minor. In today's world,
the overhead for these small changes is often high. I need to upload a
separate patch to Bugzilla. Sometimes I even need to create a new bug to
hold that patch. If that patch depends on other work I did, I need to
set up bug dependencies then worry about landing everything in the right
order. All of a sudden, the overhead isn't worth it and my positive
intentions go unacted on. Multiplied by hundreds of developers over
many years, and you can imagine the effect on software quality. With
MozReview, the overhead for itch scratching like this is minor. Just
make a small commit, push, and the system will sort everything out.
(These small commits are where I think a <em>bugless</em> process really
shines.)</p>
<p>This future world revolves around code and commits and operations on
them. While <em>MozReview</em> has <em>review</em> in its name, it's more than a
review tool: it's a <em>database</em> and interface to code and its state.</p>
<p><strong>In this code first world, Bugzilla performs an ancillary role.</strong>
Bugzilla is still there. Bugs are still there. MozReview review requests
and commits <em>link</em> to bugs. But it is the code, not bugs, that are king.
If you want to do anything with code, you interact with the code
tools. And Bugzilla is not one of them.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at this is that nearly everything involving code
or commits becomes excised from Bugzilla. This would relegate Bugzilla
to, well, an issue/bug tracker. And - ta da - that's something it excels
at since that's what it was originally designed to do! MozReview will
provide an adequate platform to discuss code (a platform that Bugzilla
provides today since it hosts code review). So if <em>not Bugzilla</em>
tools are handling everything related to code, do you really need a bug
any more?</p>
<p>This is the future we're trying to build with MozReview and Autoland.
And this is why I think bugs and Bugzilla will play a less central role
in the development process of Firefox in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many consequences and concerns about making this shift.
You would be rational to be skeptical and doubt that this is the right
thing to do. I have another post in the works that attempts to outline
some common conerns and propose solutions to many of them. Before writing
a long comment pointing out every way in which this will fail to work,
I encourage you to wait for that post to be published. Stay tuned.</p>

  <p>Mozilla's Mercurial documentation has historically been pretty bad. The
documentation on MDN (which I refuse to link to) is horribly disjointed
and contains a lot of outdated recommendations. I've made attempts to
burn some of it to the ground, but it is just too overwhelming.</p>
<p>I've been casually creating my own Mercurial documentation tailored for
Mozillians. It's called
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/index.html">Mercurial for Mozillians</a>.</p>
<p>It started as a way to document extensions inside the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository. But, it has since evolved to cover other topics, like how to
install Mercurial, how to develop using bookmarks, and how to interact
with a unified Firefox repository. The documentation is nowhere near
complete. But it already has some very useful content beyond what MDN
offers.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy about the idea of having generic Mercurial documentation
on a Mozilla domain (this should be part of the official Mercurial
documentation). Nor am I crazy about moving content off MDN. I'm sure
content will move to its appropriate location later. Until then,
enjoy some curated Mercurial documentation!</p>

  <p>The <em>bzexport</em> Mercurial extension - an extension that enables you to
easily create new Bugzilla bugs and upload patches to Bugzilla for
review - just received some
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1033394">major updates</a>.</p>
<p>First, we now have automated test coverage of bzexport! This is built on
top of the version control test harness I
<a href="/blog/2014/10/14/robustly-testing-version-control-at-mozilla/">previously blogged about</a>.
As part of the tests, we start Docker containers that run the same code
that's running on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a>,
so interactions with Bugzilla are properly tested. This is much, much
better than mocking HTTP requests and responses because if Bugzilla
changes, our tests will detect it. Yay continuous integration.</p>
<p>Second, bzexport now uses Bugzilla' REST API instead of the legacy bzAPI
endpoint for all but 1 HTTP request. This should make BMO maintainers
very happy.</p>
<p>Third and finally, bzexport now uses shared code for obtaining Bugzilla
credentials. The behavior is
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/auth.html">documented</a>,
of course. Behavior is <strong>not backwards compatible</strong>. If you were using some
old configuration values, you will now see warnings when running bzexport.
These warnings are actionable, so I shouldn't need to describe them
here.</p>
<p>Please obtain the new code by pulling the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository. Or, if you have a Firefox clone, run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em>.</p>
<p>If you find any regressions, file a bug in the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Developer%20Services&amp;component=Mercurial%3A%20bzexport">Developers Services :: Mercurial: bzexport</a>
component and have it depend on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1033394">bug 1033394</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to Steve Fink, Ed Morley, and Ted Mielczarek for looking
at the code.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Recent posts on my blog have talked about the
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">difficulty submitting changes to Firefox</a>
and the <a href="/blog/2015/01/10/code-first-and-the-rise-of-the-dvcs-and-github/">rise of GitHub</a>.
I encourage you to stop reading this post and read them now if you
haven't already.</p>
<p>As I was looking at the
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/#list-of-process-debt">list of process debt contributing to Firefox</a>,
one thought kept creeping into my mind: <strong>how many of these items go
away if we utilize GitHub?</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned in these two posts, GitHub's popularity has essentially
commoditized many items on this list, especially the parts around source
control and submitting patches for consideration (just fork and open a
pull request). It seems that everyone these days is on GitHub and asking
people to use GitHub to send changes to Firefox would almost certainly
be well-received by contributors and even Mozilla staff.</p>
<p>Here's what I think: <strong>Mozilla should utilize GitHub for Firefox
development.</strong></p>
<p>The verb in that sentence is important: I purposefully said <em>utilize</em>
and not something like <em>switch to</em>. <strong>To switch or not to switch to
GitHub for Firefox development is a false dillemma and a logical
fallacy.</strong> So is the question about <em>switching to Git</em>. As I explain later,
there is a spectrum of options available and <em>switching</em> or <em>not
switching</em> are on the extremes. <em>Utilize</em> doesn't preclude a binary
<em>switch</em> or <em>don't switch</em> outcome, but it does keep an array of options
on the table for consideration.</p>
<p>So, how should Mozilla <em>utilize</em> GitHub for Firefox development?</p>
<p>I think that insisting people establish Bugzilla accounts and upload
patches to Bugzilla/bugs is an anitquated practice in desperate need of
an overhaul. I think that if someone has written code, they should be
able to essentially throw it over a wall to initiate the change process.
They should be able to do this in a manner that incurs little to no
<em>process debt</em>. We, Mozilla, should be able to take only code and
integrate it into Firefox, assuming a trusted person - a module owner
or peer - agrees and grants review. <strong>GitHub pull requests would
facilitate a lesser-involved code contribution mechanism.</strong></p>
<p>Another benefit of GitHub is that the web interface goes further than
just code submission: they also have facilities for editing files. It's
possible to
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/">edit a file in someone else's repository and create a pull request</a>
direct from the web interface! My
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">post on process debt</a>
began by comparing the process of <em>edit a wiki</em> versus the current
Firefox change process. GitHub's web-based editing essentially reduces
the gap to cosmetic differences. <strong>GitHub's ease of contributing purely
via the browser would open the door to more contribution for
lesser-involved changes</strong> (sometimes referred to as <em>good first bugs</em>).</p>
<p>To state it explicitly, <strong>I support the use of GitHub pull requests for
submitting changes to Firefox</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, there are some concerns and challenges about doing this. These
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fragmentation of code review and tracking could be problematic for
  Mozilla staff and other highly-active individuals.</li>
<li>GitHub can lose some parts of code review after rebasing and force
  pushes. <strong>Edit: Comments below indicate this is no longer a problem.
  Great!</strong></li>
<li>You can only assign 1 reviewer per pull request.</li>
<li>GitHub sends an email/notification per review comment. This can be
  extremely annoying for some mail clients.</li>
<li>GitHub doesn't have a mechanism for dealing with security bugs.</li>
<li>Data sovereignty concerns (all data hosted on GitHub and subject to
  their data retention and access policies). Their API has query limits,
  which can limit machine use somewhat.</li>
<li>GitHub's model favors merges over rebases. Merges have a number of
  downsides, especially for large projects, and we strongly prefer to
  maintain our mostly-linear Firefox repository history.</li>
<li>GitHub's model favors appending commits rather than rewriting commits.
  (This is due to Git badness when you force push.) Mozilla favors a
  world where the final commit is what's reviewed and landed.</li>
<li>Git != Mercurial. Firefox is canonically stored in Mercurial. There is
  some impedence mismatch here. But nothing tools can't overcome.</li>
<li>The <em>Merge Pull Request</em> button is almost completely useless for
  Firefox's existing and future workflows. This partially invalidates
  other niceness the pure GitHub pull request workflow buys you.</li>
<li>Everything is lumped into a single bucket. We lose component-level
  subscriptions, making following harder.</li>
<li>Following the entire Firefox project on GitHub would produce an
  overwhelming fire hose of data.</li>
<li>We don't control GitHub and our options for extending it to extract
  even more process optimization are limited to what their APIs support
  and what they choose to implement.</li>
<li>We are at the whim of GitHub should they ever change a feature or API.</li>
<li>See also <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Github-challenges">Servo's list of challenges</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these issues can be overcome by tools and automation (which I
would happily build in my capacity as a Developer Productivity Engineer
at Mozilla). Others are more fundamental and seemingly would require
buy-in and/or support from very senior Mozillians.</p>
<p>If Mozilla were to go forward utilizing GitHub pull requests for
Firefox, I think it should be done incrementally rather than going
all-in and attempting the entire GitHub workflow from the start.
Although, this would mean diverging from GitHub's well-known practices,
which would <em>increase</em> process debt from the GitHub base level. I don't
like that. But I think it is a step in the right direction. Partial
reduction in process debt is better than no reduction.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>incrementally</em> start accepting pull requests? Well,
<strong>I don't think code review should initially be conducted on GitHub</strong>.
When you look at the above list of concerns, many of them are around code
review and interacting with pull requests. I think there's too much
badness and risk there to make me comfortable about <em>moving</em> things to
GitHub and giving GitHub exclusive domain over this important data,
at least initially.</p>
<p>But if code review isn't conducted on GitHub, what's the value of a pull
request? <strong>A pull request would be a well-defined and well-understood
mechanism for importing data into Mozilla's systems</strong>. For example,
submitting a pull request would automatically result in the creation
of a review request on
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozreview.html">MozReview</a>
or even a bug/attachment/review on Bugzilla.
This would allow people to send code to Mozilla easily while
simultaneously allowing Mozillians to use familiar tools and processes
without the aforementioned concerns with GitHub. That appears to be
win-win.</p>
<p>Once we have a simple mechanism in place for turning pull requests into
MozReview's review requests, we can start playing around with the
syncing of code review activity between Mozilla and GitHub so review
activity on either system results in cross-posting. There is precedent
for this today. <a href="http://gerrithub.io/">GerritHub</a> has bi-directional
syncing of code review activity between GitHub and Gerrit. Facebook also
does something similar, syncing data between their internal Phabricator
instance. Mozilla to GitHub sync would not be difficult: we control all
those systems and I'm pretty confident in our ability to make a GitHub API
call when a MozReview review request is updated (we already make
Bugzilla API calls, so we know this works). GitHub to Mozilla is a bit more
difficult. But, others have done it: I'm confident we can too.</p>
<p>I see bi-directional syncing of GitHub pull request / code review data
between GitHub and Mozilla as achievable and relatively free from
controversy. I think we should experiment with this sometime in 2015,
probably in Q2, once MozReview is in better condition to <em>host</em> GitHub
pull requests. Although, supporting Git in MozReview is on my Q1 goals
list, so maybe I sneak this into Q1. Time will tell.</p>
<p>At this time, I believe using GitHub for the ingestion of proposed
Firefox commits into existing Mozilla systems should be the limit of
Firefox's GitHub presence, at least as far as day-to-day development
goes. If other groups want to use GitHub more actively and they find a
way to make that work while placating everyone who cares, power to them.
But I think moving the pendulum any further toward GitHub - including
things like making GitHub the exclusive location for code review data,
utilizing GitHub Issues, and making Git[Hub] the canonical Firefox
repository - remain difficult and controverial propositions. I believe
each of these to be medium to high cost and risk with low to medium
reward. I believe it would be wise to defer these questions until we
have data about the value of GitHub pull requests for Firefox
development.</p>
<p>To summarize, I propose using GitHub pull requests as an alternate,
supported front end to the code contribution pathway. We would eliminate
a lot of <em>process debt</em> for non-Mozillians by supporting a known process.
Mozillians on the review and code submission side of the process
shouldn't have to worry about change because, well, it shouldn't matter
if a commit came from GitHub or elsewhere: it will all appear mostly
the same. I'm not saying that we will never expand our utilization
of GitHub for Firefox development beyond this scope. But I am saying
that I don't think it would be prudent to do so today.</p>
<p>And that's how and why I think Mozilla should utilize GitHub for Firefox
development.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>While I'm here, <strong>it's important to note that GitHub does not and will
likely never solve many items from our list of Firefox contribution
process debt</strong>. GitHub is not a build system nor a tool for running
and analyzing code and tests. We still have many, many deficiencies
and usability concerns here. We have historically under-invested in
this area and utilizing GitHub in any capacity won't address these
other issues. In addition, <strong>Firefox is a magnitude larger and more
complex than the vast majority of projects on GitHub. We will always
be burdened with the cost of our success - of coping with and
maintaining the additional complexity associated with that scale</strong>.
Firefox is <em>at least</em> the 0.1%. There's a good chance GitHub and/or many
of the amazing services associated with it (like Travis-CI) won't scale to
our needs. I'd love to be proved wrong here, but the reality is
supporting a marginal use case like Firefox likely isn't at the top of
goals for GitHub and related organizations unless it is in their
business interest (read: financial interest) to do so. One can hope that
as these companies try to capture more of the enterprise market via
offerings such as GitHub Enterprise that they invest in the features
and scalability that large projects and organizations like Mozilla and
Firefox need.</p>
