  <p>Version control services and interaction with them play an important
role at any company. Despite version control being a critical part
of your infrastructure, my experience from working at a few companies
and talking with others is that version control often doesn't get the
testing love that other services do. Hooks get written, spot-tested
by the author, and deployed. Tools that interact with version control
often rely on behavior that may or may not change over time,
especially when the version of your version control software is
upgraded.</p>
<p>We've seen this pattern at Mozilla. Mercurial hooks and extensions
were written and deployed to the server without test coverage. As a
result, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1070637">things break</a>
when we try to upgrade the server. This happens a few times and you
naturally develop an attitude of fear, uncertainty, and doubt around
touching anything on the server (or the clients for that matter). <em>If
it isn't broken, why fix it</em> prevails for months or years. Then one an
enthusiastic individual comes around wanting to deploy some hot new
functionality. You tell them the path is arduous because the server is
running antiquated versions of software and nothing is tested. The
individual realizes the amazing change isn't worth the effort and
justifiably throws up their hands and gives up. This is almost a
textbook definition of how not having test coverage can result
in technical debt. This is the position Mozilla is trying to recover
from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts I've had since joining the Developer Services
Team at Mozilla a little over a month ago has been changing the story
about how we test version control at Mozilla.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that Mozilla now has a robust enough testing
infrastructure in place around our Mercurial server that we're feeling
pretty good about silencing the doubters when it comes to changing
server behavior. Here's how we did it.</p>
<p>The genesis of this project was likely me getting involved with the
hg-git and Mercurial projects. For hg-git, I learned a bit about
Mercurial internals and how extensions work. When I looked at Mercurial
extensions and hooks used by Mozilla, I started to realize what parts
were good and what parts were bad. I realized what parts would likely
break after upgrades. When I started contributing patches to Mercurial
itself, I took notice of how Mercurial is tested. When I discovered
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests">T Tests</a>, I thought,
<em>wow, that's pretty cool: we should use them to test Mozilla's Mercurial
customizations!</em></p>
<p>After some frustrations with Mercurial extensions breaking after
Mercurial upgrades, I wanted to do something about it to prevent this from
happening again. I'm a
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">huge fan of unified repositories</a>.
So earlier this year, I reached out to the various parties who maintain
all the different components and convinced nearly everyone that
establishing a single repository for all the version control code was a
<a href="/blog/2014/02/05/new-repository-for-mozilla-version-control-tools/">good idea</a>.
The <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository was born. Things were slow at first. It was initially pretty
much my playground for hosting Mercurial extensions that I authored.
Fast forward a few months, and the version-control-tools repository now
contains full history imports of our
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hghooks">Mercurial hooks</a>
that are deployed on <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>, the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgtemplates">templates</a>
used to render HTML on hg.mozilla.org, and pretty much every
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext">Mercurial extension</a>
authored by Mozillians, including
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/pushlog-legacy">pushlog</a>.
Having all the code in one repository has been very useful. It has
simplified server deployments: we now pull 1 repository instead of 3. If
there is a dependency between different components, we can do the update
atomically. These are all benefits of using a single repository instead
of N&gt;1.</p>
<p>While version-control-tools was still pretty much my personal
playground, I introduced a short script for running tests. It was pretty
basic: just find test files and invoke them with Mercurial's test
harness. It served my needs pretty well. Over time, as more and more
functionality was rolled into version-control-tools, we expanded the
scope of the test harness.</p>
<p>We can now run Python unit tests (in addition to Mercurial .t tests).
Test all of the things!</p>
<p>We set up <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/">continuous integration</a>
with Jenkins so tests run after check-in and alert us when things fail.</p>
<p>We added <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/coveragepy/?">code coverage</a>
so we can see what is and isn't being tested. Using code coverage data,
we've
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075274">identified a server upgrade bug</a>
before it happens. We're also using the data to ensure that code is tested
as thoroughly as it needs to be. The code coverage data has been
invaluable at assessing the quality of our tests. I'm still shocked that
Firefox developers tolerate not having JavaScript code coverage when
developing Firefox features. (I'm not saying code coverage is perfect,
merely that it is a valuable tool in your arsenal.)</p>
<p>We added support for running tests against multiple versions of
Mercurial. We even test the bleeding edge of Mercurial so we know when
an upstream Mercurial change breaks our code. So, no more surprises on
Mercurial release day. I can tell you today that we have a handful of
extensions that are broken in Mercurial 3.2, due for release around
November 1. (Hopefully we'll fix them before release.)</p>
<p>We have Vagrant configurations so you can start a virtual machine that
runs the tests the same way Jenkins does.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the test harness is the ability to spin up Docker
containers as part of tests. Right now, this is limited to running
Bugzilla during tests. But I imagine the scope will only increase over
time.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I want to quickly explain how amazing Mercurial's
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests#Writing_a_shell_script_test">.t tests</a>
are. These are a flavor of tests used by Mercurial and the dominant form
of new tests added to the version-control-tools repository. These tests
are glorified shell scripts annotated with expected
command output and other metadata. It might be easier to explain by
showing. Take
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t">bzpost's tests</a>
as an example. The bzpost extension automatically posts commit URLs to
Bugzilla during push.
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2014/06/30/update-bugzilla-automatically-on-push/">Read more</a>
if you are interested. What I like so much about .t tests is that they
are actually testing the user experience. The test
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l69">actually runs hg push</a>
and verifies the output is exactly what is intended. Furthermore,
since we're running a Dockerized Bugzilla server during the test, we're
able to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l108">verify</a>
that the bzpost extension actually resulted in Bugzilla comments being
added to the appropriate bug(s). Contrast this with unit tests that only
test a subset of functionality. Or, contrast with writing a lot of
boilerplate and often hard-to-read code that invokes processes and uses
regular expressions, etc to compare output. I find .t tests are more
concise and they do a better job of testing user experience. More than
once I've written a .t test and thought <em>this user experience doesn't
feel right, I should change the behavior to be more user friendly</em>. This
happened because I was writing actual end-user commands as part of
writing tests and seeing the exact output the user would see. It is
much harder to attain this sense of understanding when writing unit
tests. I can name a few projects with poor command line interfaces that
could benefit from this approach... I'm not saying .t tests are perfect
or that they should replace other testing methodologies such as unit
tests. I just think they are very useful for accurately testing
higher-level functionality and for assessing user experience. I really
wish we had these tests for mach commands...</p>
<p>Anyway, with a proper testing harness in place for our version control code,
we've been pretty good about ensuring new code is properly tested. When
people submit new hooks or patches to existing hooks, we can push back and
refuse to grant review unless tests are included. When someone requests a
new deployment to the server, we can look at what changed, cross-reference
to test coverage, and assess the riskiness of the deployment. We're getting
to the point where we just trust our tests and server deployments are minor
events. Concerns over accidental regressions due to server changes are
waning. We can tell people <em>if you really care about this not breaking,
you need a test</em> and <em>if you add a test, we'll support it for you.</em>
People are often more than happy to write tests to ensure them peace of
mind, especially when that test's presence shifts maintenance
responsibility away from them. We're happy because we don't have many
surprises (and fire drills) at deployment time. It's a win-win!</p>
<p>So, what's next? Good question! We still have a number of large gaps in
our test coverage. Our code to synchronize repositories from the master
server to read-only slaves is likely the most critical omission. We also
don't yet have a good way of reproducing our server environment.
Ideally, we'd run the continuous integration in an environment that's
very similar to production. Same package versions and everything. This
would also allow us to simulate the actual hg.mozilla.org server
topology during tests. Currently, our tests are more unit-style than
integration-style. We rely on the consistent behavior of Mercurial and
other tools as sufficient proxies for test accuracy and we back those up
with running the tests on the staging server before production
deployment. But these aren't a substitute for an accurate reproduction
of the production servers, especially when it comes to things like the
replication tests. We'll get there some day. I also have plans to
improve Mercurial's test harness to better facilitate some of our
advanced use cases. I would absolutely love to make Mercurial's .t test
harness more consumable outside the context of Mercurial.
(<a href="https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram">cram</a> is one such attempt at this.)
We also need to incorporate the Git server code into this repository.
Currently, I'm pretty sure everything Git at Mozilla is untested.
Challenge accepted!</p>
<p>In summary, our story for testing version control at Mozilla has gone
from a cobbled together mess to something cohesive and comprehensive.
This has given us confidence to move fast without breaking things. I think
the weeks of people time invested into improving the state of testing
was well spent and will pay enormous dividends going forward. Looking
back, the mountain of technical debt now looks like a mole hill. I feel
good knowing that I played a part in making this change.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a really nifty tool. It
vastly lowers the barrier to distributing and executing applications. It
forces people to think about building server side code as a collection
of discrete applications and services. When it was released, I instantly
realized its potential, including for uses it wasn't primary intended
for, such as applications in automated build and test environments.</p>
<p>Over the months, Docker's feature set has grown and many of its
shortcomings have been addressed. It's more usable than ever. Most of my
early complaints and concerns have been addressed or are actively being
addressed.</p>
<p>But one supposedly solved part of Docker still bothers me: image
creation.</p>
<p>One of the properties that gets people excited about Docker is the
ability to ship execution environments around as data. Simply produce an
image once, transfer it to a central server, pull it down from anywhere,
and execute. That's pretty damn elegant. I dare say Docker has solved
the image <em>distribution</em> problem. (Ignore for a minute that the
implementation detail of how images map to filesystems still has a few
quirks to work out. But they'll solve that.)</p>
<p>The ease at which Docker manages images is brilliant. I, like many, was
overcome with joy and marvelled at how amazing it was. But as I started
producing more and more images, my initial excitement turned to
frustration.</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me most about images is that the de facto and
recommended method for producing images is neither deterministic nor
results in minimal images. I strongly believe that the current
recommended and applied approach is far from optimal and has too many
drawbacks. Let me explain.</p>
<p>If you look at the Dockerfiles from the official
<a href="https://github.com/docker-library">Docker library</a>
(examples: <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/node/blob/51b1dd1984e287189106884c453ca506737eed78/0.11/Dockerfile">Node</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/master/5.7/Dockerfile">MySQL</a>),
you notice something in common: they tend to use <em>apt-get update</em> as one
of their first steps. For those not familiar with Apt, that command will
synchronize the package repository indexes with a remote server. In
other words, depending on when you run the command, different versions
of packages will be pulled down and the result of image creation will
differ. The same thing happens when you clone a Git repository. Depending
on when you run the command - when you create the image - you may get
different output. If you create an image from scratch today, it could have
a different version of say Python than it did the day before. This can be
a big deal, especially if you are trying to use Docker to accurately
reproduce environments.</p>
<p>This non-determinism of building Docker images really bothers me. It
seems to run counter to Docker's goal of facilitating reliable
environments for running applications. Sure, one person can
produce an image once, upload it to a Docker Registry server, and have
others pull it. But there are applications where independent production
of the same base image is important.</p>
<p>One area is the security arena. There are many people who are
justifiably paranoid about running binaries produced by others and
pre-built Docker images set off all kinds of alarms. So, these people
would rather build an image from source, from a Dockerfile, than pull
binaries. Except then they build the image from a Dockerfile and the
application doesn't run because of an incompatibility with a new
version of some random package whose version wasn't pinned. Of course,
you probably lost numerous hours tracing down this obscure reason. How
frustrating! Determinism and verifiability as part of Docker image
creation help solve this problem.</p>
<p>Deterministic image building is also important for disaster recovery.
What happens if your Docker Registry and all hosts with copies of its
images go down? If you go to build the images from scratch again, what
guarantee do you have that things will behave the same? Without
determinism, you are taking a risk that things will be different and
your images won't work as intended. That's scary. (Yes, Docker is no
different here from existing tools that attempt to solve this problem.)</p>
<p>What if your open source product relies on a proprietary component that
can't be legally distributed? So much for Docker image distribution. The
best you can do is provide a base image and instructions for completing
the process. But if that doesn't work deterministically, your users now
have varying Docker images, again undermining Docker's goal of
increasing consistency.</p>
<p>My other main concern about Docker images is that they tend to be large,
both in size and in scope. Many Docker images use a full Linux install
as their base. A lot of people start with a base e.g. Ubuntu or Debian
install, <em>apt-get install</em> the required packages, do some extra
configuration, and call it a day. Simple and straightforward, yes. But
this practice makes me more than a bit uneasy.</p>
<p>One of the themes surrounding Docker is minimalism. Containers are
lighter than VMs; just ship your containers around; deploy dozens or
hundreds of containers simultaneously; compose your applications of
many, smaller containers instead of larger, monolithic ones. I get it
and am totally on board. So why are Docker images built on top of the
bloaty excess of a full operating system (modulo the kernel)? Do I
really need a package manager in my Docker image? Do I need a compiler
or header files so I can e.g. build binary Python extensions? No, I
don't, thank you.</p>
<p>As a security-minded person, I want my Docker images to consist of only
the files they need, especially binary files. By leaving out
non-critical elements from your image and your run-time environment,
you are reducing the surface area to attack. If your application
doesn't need a shell, don't include a shell and don't leave yourself
potentially vulnerable to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29">shellshock</a>.
I want the attacker who inevitably breaks out of my application into the
outer container to get nothing, not something that looks like an operating
system and has access to tools like curl and wget that could potentially
be used to craft a more advanced attack (which might even be able to
exploit a kernel vulnerability to break out of the container). Of
course, you can and should pursue additional security protections in
addition to attack surface reduction to secure your execution
environment. Defense in depth. But that doesn't give Docker images a
free pass on being bloated.</p>
<p>Another reason I want smaller containers is... because they are smaller.
People tend to have relatively slow upload bandwidth. Pushing Docker
images that can be hundreds of megabytes clogs my tubes. However, I'll
gladly push 10, 20, or even 50 megabytes of only the necessary data.
When you factor in that Docker image creation isn't deterministic, you
also realize that different people are producing different versions of
images from the same Dockerfiles and that you have to spend extra
bandwidth transferring the different versions around. This bites me all
the time when I'm creating new images and am experimenting with the
creation steps. I tend to bypass the fake caching mechanism (fake
because the output isn't deterministic) and this really results in data
explosion.</p>
<p>I understand why Docker images are neither deterministic nor minimal:
making them so is a hard problem. I think Docker was right to prioritize
solving distribution (it opens up many new possibilities). But I really
wish some effort could be put into making images deterministic (and thus
verifiable) and more minimal. I think it would make Docker an even more
appealing platform, especially for the security conscious. (As an aside,
I would absolutely love if we could ship a
<a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/01/trust-but-verify/">verifiable Firefox</a>
build, for example.)</p>
<p>These are hard problems. But they are solvable. Here's how I would do
it.</p>
<p>First, let's tackle deterministic image creation. Despite computers and
software being ideally deterministic, building software tends not to be,
so deterministic image creation is a hard problem. Even
tools like Puppet and Chef which claim to solve aspects of this problem
don't do a very good job with determinism. Read my post on
<a href="/blog/2013/06/24/the-importance-of-time-on-automated-machine-configuration/">The Importance of Time on Machine Provisioning</a>
for more on the topic. But there are solutions. <a href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>
and the <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a> package manager have the potential
to be used as the basis of a deterministic image building platform.
The <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/about.html">high-level overview of Nix</a> is
that the inputs and contents of a package determine the package ID. If
you know how Git or Mercurial get their commit SHA-1's, it's pretty much
the same concept. In theory, two people on different machines start with
the same environment and bootstrap the exact same packages, all from
source. <a href="https://gitian.org/">Gitian</a> is a similar solution. Although I
prefer Nix's content-based approach and how it goes about managing
packages and environments. Nix feels so right as a base for
deterministically building software. Anyway, yes, fully verifiable
build environments are turtles all the way down (I recommend reading
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">Tor's overview of the problem and their approach</a>.
However, Nix's approach addresses many of the turtles and silences most
of the critics. I would absolutely love if more and more Docker images
were the result of a deterministic build process like Nix. Perhaps you
could define the full set of packages (with versions) that would be
used. Let's call this the package manifest. You would then PGP sign and
distribute your manifest. You could then have Nix step through all the
dependencies, compiling everything from source. If PGP verification
fails, compilation output changes, or extra files are needed, the build
aborts or issues a warning. I have a feeling the security-minded
community would go crazy over this. I know I would.</p>
<p>OK, so now you can use Nix to produce packages (and thus images)
(more) deterministically. How do you make them minimal? Well, instead of
just packaging the entire environment, I'd employ tools like
<a href="http://www.floc.net/makejail/">makejail</a>. The purpose of makejail is to
create minimal chroot <em>jail</em> environments. These are very similar to
Docker/LXC containers. In fact, you can often take a tarball of a chroot
directory tree and convert it into a Docker container! With makejail,
you define a configuration file saying among other things what binaries
to run inside the jail. makejail will trace file I/O of that binary and
copy over accessed files. The result is an execution environment that
(hopefully) contains only what you need. Then, create an archive of that
environment and pipe it into <em>docker build</em> to create a minimal Docker
image.</p>
<p>In summary, Nix provides you with a reliable and verifiable build
environment. Tools like makejail pair down the produced packages into
something minimal, which you then turn into your Docker image. Regular
people can still pull binary images, but they are much smaller and more
in tune with Docker's principles of minimalism. The paranoid among us can
produce the same bits from source (after verifying the inputs look
credible and waiting through a few hours of compiling). Or, perhaps
the individual files in the image could be signed and thus verified via
trust somehow? The company deploying Docker can have peace of mind
that disaster scenarios resulting in Docker image loss should not
result in total loss of the image (just rebuild it exactly as it was
before).</p>
<p>You'll note that my proposed solution does not involve Dockerfiles as
they exist today. I just don't think Dockerfile's design of stackable
layers of commands is the right model, at least for people who care
about determinism and minimalism. You really want a recipe that
knows how to create a set of relevant files and some metadata like what
ports to expose, what command to run on container start, etc and turn
that into your Docker image. I suppose you could accomplish this all
inside Dockerfiles. But that's a pretty radical departure from how
Dockerfiles work today. I'm not sure the two solutions are compatible.
Something to think about.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure of what it would take to add deterministic and verifiable
building of minimal and more secure Docker images. And, if someone
solved this problem, it could be applicable outside of Docker (again,
Docker images are essentially chroot environments plus metadata).
As I was putting the finishing touches on this article, I discovered
<a href="http://zef.me/6049/nix-docker/">nix-docker</a>. It looks very promising!
I hope the Docker community latches on to these ideas and makes
deterministic, verifiable, and minimal images the default, not the
exception.</p>

  <p>I recently gained SSH access to Mozilla's Mercurial servers. This allows
me to run some custom queries directly against the data. I was
interested in some high-level numbers and thought I'd share the results.</p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org hosts a total of 3,445 repositories. Of these, there are
1,223 distinct root commits (i.e. distinct graphs). Altogether, there
are 32,123,211 commits. Of those, there are 865,594 distinct commits (not
double counting commits that appear in multiple repositories).</p>
<p>We have a high ratio of total commits to distinct commits (about 37:1).
This means we have high duplication of data on disk. This basically
means a lot of repos are clones/forks of existing ones. No big surprise
there.</p>
<p>What is surprising to me is the low number of total distinct commits. I
was expecting the number to run into the millions. (Firefox itself
accounts for ~240,000 commits.) Perhaps a lot of the data is sitting in
Git, Bitbucket, and GitHub. Sounds like a good data mining expedition...</p>

  <p>When companies or organizations deploy version control, they have to
make many choices. One of them is how many repositories to create.
Your choices are essentially a) a single, monolithic repository that
holds everything b) many separate, smaller repositories that hold
all the individual parts c) something in between.</p>
<p>The prevailing convention today (especially in the open source
realm) is to create many separate and loosely coupled repositories,
each repository mapping to a specific product or service. That does
seem reasonable: if you were organizing files on your filesystem,
you would group them by functionality or role (photos, music,
documents, etc). And, version control tools are functionally
filesystems. So it makes sense to draw repository boundaries at
directory/role levels.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the separate repository convention is the
scaling behavior of our version control tools. Git, the popular
tool in open source these days, doesn't scale well to very large
repositories due to - among other things - not having narrow clones
(fetching a subset of files). It scales well enough to the
overwhelming majority of projects. But if you are a large
organization generating lots of data (read: gigabytes of data over
hundreds of thousands of files and commits) for version control,
Git is unsuitable in its current form. Other tools (like Mercurial)
don't currently fare that much better (although Mercurial has plans
to tackle these scaling vectors).</p>
<p>Despite popular convention and even limitations in tools, companies
like Google and Facebook opt to run large, monolithic repositories.
Google runs Perforce.
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook is on Mercurial</a>,
or at least is in the process of migrating to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Why do these companies run monolithic repositories?
In <a href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Google's words</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have a single large depot with almost all of Google's projects
on it. This aids agile development and is much loved by our users,
since it allows almost anyone to easily view almost any code, allows
projects to share code, and allows engineers to move freely from
project to project. Documentation and data is stored on the server
as well as code.</em></p>
<p>So, monolithic repositories are all about moving fast and getting things
done more efficiently. In other words, <strong>monolithic repositories
increase developer productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, monolithic repositories are also more compatible with
the ebb and flow of large organizations and large software projects.
Components, features, products, and teams come and go, merge and split.
The only constant is change. And if you are maintaining separate
repositories that attempt to map to this ever-changing organizational
topology, you are going to have a bad time. Either you'll be
constantly copying, moving, merging, splitting, etc data and repositories.
Or your repositories will be organized in a very non-logical and
non-intuitive manner. That translates to overhead and lost productivity.
I think that monolithic repositories handle the realities of large
organizations much better. Big change or reorganization you want
to reflect? You can make a single, atomic, history-preserving commit
to move things around. I think that's much more manageable, especially
when you consider the difficulty and annoyance of history-preserving
changes across repositories.</p>
<p>Naysayers will decry monolithic repositories on principled and practical
grounds.</p>
<p>The principled camp will say that separate repositories
constitute a loosely coupled (dare I say service oriented) architecture
that maps better to how software is consumed, assembled, and deployed
and that erecting barriers in the form of separate repositories
deliberately enforces this architecture. I agree. However, you can
still maintain a loosely coupled architecture with monolithic
repositories. The Subversion model of checking out a single tree
<em>from a larger repository</em> proves this. Furthermore, I would say
architecture decisions should be enforced by people (via code review,
etc), not via version control repository topology. I believe this
principled argument against monolithic repositories to be rather weak.</p>
<p>The principled camp living in the open source realm may also decry
monolithic repositories as an affront to the spirit of open source.
They would say that a monolithic repository creates unfairly strong
ties to the organization that operates it and creates barriers to
forking, etc. This may be true. But monolithic repositories don't
intrinsically infringe on the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">basic software freedoms</a>,
organizations do. Therefore, I find this principled argument rather
weak.</p>
<p>The practical camp will say that monolithic repositories just don't
scale or aren't suitable for general audiences. These concerns are
real.</p>
<p><em>Fully</em> distributed version control systems (every commit on every
machine) definitely don't scale past certain limits. Depending on your
repository and user base, your scaling limits include disk space
(repository data terabytes in size), bandwidth (repository data terabytes
in size), filesystem (repository hundreds of thousands or millions of
files), CPU and memory (operations on large repositories take too
many system resources), and many heads/branches (tools like Git and
Mercurial don't scale well to tens of thousands of heads/branches).
These limitations with fully distributed version
control are why distributed version control tools like Git and
Mercurial support a partially-distributed mode that behaves more like
your classical server-client model, like those employed by Subversion,
Perforce, etc. Git supports shallow clone and sparse checkout.
Mercurial supports shallow clone (via remotefilelog) and has planned
support for narrow clone and sparse checkout by the end of 2015.
Of course, you can avoid the scaling limitations of distributed
version control by employing a non-distributed tool, such as Subversion.
Many companies continue to reach this conclusion today. However,
users adapted to the distributed workflow would likely be
up in arms (they would probably use tools like hg-subversion or git-svn
to maintain their workflows). So, while scaling of version control
can be a real concern, there are solutions and workarounds. However,
they do involve falling back to a partially-distributed model.</p>
<p>Another concern with monolithic repositories is user access control. You
inevitably have code or data that is more sensitive and want to limit
who can change or even access it. Separate repositories seem to
facilitate a simpler model: per-repository access control. With
monolithic repositories, you have to worry about per-directory/subtree
permissions, an increased risk of data leaking, etc. This concern is
more real with distributed version control, as distributed data and
access control aren't naturally compatible. But these issues can be
resolved. And if the tooling supports it, there is only a semantic
difference between managing access control between repositories versus
components of a single repository.</p>
<p>When it comes to repository hosting conversions, I agree with Google
and Facebook: <strong>I prefer monolithic repositories</strong>. When I am interacting
with version control, I just want to get stuff done. I don't want to
waste time dealing with multiple commands to manage multiple
repositories. I don't want to waste time or expend cognitive load
dealing with submodule, subrepository, or big files management. I
don't want to waste time trying to find and reuse code, data, or
documentation. I want everything at my fingertips, where it can be
easily discovered, inspected, and used. Monolithic repositories
facilitate these workflows more than separate repositories and make
me more productive as a result.</p>
<p>Now, if only all the tools and processes we use and love would work
with monolithic repositories...</p>

  <small>September 05, 2014 at 02:50 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Of of my first tasks in my
<a href="/blog/2014/09/05/new-job-role/">new role</a> as a <em>Developer Productivity
Engineer</em> is to help make Mozilla's Mercurial server better. Many of the
awesome things we have planned rely on features in newer versions of
Mercurial. It's therefore important for us to upgrade our Mercurial
server to a modern version (we are currently running 2.5.4) and to keep
our Mercurial server upgraded as time passes.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why we haven't historically upgraded our
Mercurial server. First, as anyone who has maintained high-availability
systems will tell you, there is the attitude of <em>if it isn't broken,
don't fix it.</em> In other words, Mercurial 2.5.4 is working fine, so why
mess with a good thing. This was all fine and dandy - until Mercurial
started falling over in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>But the blocker towards upgrading that I want to talk about today is
systems verification. There has been extreme caution around upgrading
Mercurial at Mozilla because it is a critical piece of Mozilla's
infrastructure and if the upgrade were to not go well, the outage
would be disastrous for developer productivity and could even jeopardize
an emergency Firefox release.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like to say that a modern version of Mercurial on the
server would be a drop-in replacement (Mercurial has a great committment
to backwards compatibility and has loose coupling between clients and
servers such that upgrading servers should not impact clients), there is
always a risk that something will change. And that risk is compounded by
the amount of custom code we have running on our server.</p>
<p>The way you protect against unexpected changes is testing. In the ideal
world, you have a robust test suite that you run against a staging
instance of a service to validate that any changes have no impact. In
the absence of testing, you are left with fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
FUD is an especially horrible philosophy when it comes to managing
servers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have a great testing infrastructure for
Mozilla's Mercurial server. And I want to change that.</p>
<h2>Reproducing the Server Environment</h2>
<p>When writing tests, it is important for the thing being tested to be as
similar as possible to the real thing. This is why so many people have
an aversion to mocking: every time you alter the test environment, you run
the risk that those differences from reality will mask changes seen in
the real environment.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that a good first goal for creating a test suite against
our Mercurial server should be to reproduce the production server and
environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a Vagrant environment that attempts to
reproduce the official environment as closely as possible. It starts
one virtual machine for the SSH/master server. It starts a separate
virtual machine for the hgweb/slave servers. The virtual machines are
booting CentOS. This is different than production, where we run RHEL.
But they are similar enough (and can share the same packages) that the
differences shouldn't matter too much, at least for now.</p>
<h2>Using Puppet</h2>
<p>In production, Mozilla is using Puppet to manage the Mercurial servers.
Unfortunately, the actual Puppet configs that Mozilla is running are
behind a firewall, mainly for security reasons. This is potentially
a huge setback for my reproducibility effort, as I'd like to have
my virtual machines use the same exact Puppet configs as whats used
in production so the environments match as closely as possible. This
would also save me a lot of work from having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ben Kero has extracted the Mercurial-relevant Puppet
config files into a
<a href="https://github.com/bkero/puppet-module-hg">standalone repository</a>.
Apparently that repository gets rolled into the production Puppet
configs periodically. So, my virtual machines and production can share
the same Mercurial Puppet files. Nice!</p>
<p>It wasn't long after starting to use the standalone Puppet configs that
I realized this would be a rabbit hole. This first manifests in the
standalone Puppet code referencing things that exist in the hidden
Mozilla Puppet files. So the liberation was only partially successful.
Sad panda.</p>
<p>So, I'm now in the process of creating a <em>fake Mozilla</em> Puppet
environment that mimics the base Mozilla environment (from the closed
repo) and am modifying the shared Puppet Mercurial code to work with
both versions. This is a royal pain, but it needs to be done if we want
to reproduce production and maintain peace of mind that test results
reflect reality.</p>
<p>Because reproducing runtime environments is important for reproducing
and solving bugs and for testing, <strong>I call on the maintainers of
Mozilla's closed Puppet repository to liberate it from behind its
firewall</strong>. I'd like to see a public Puppet configuration tree available
for all to use so that anyone anywhere can reproduce the state of a
server or service operated by Mozilla to within reasonable
approximation. Had this already been done, it would have saved me hours
of work. As it stands, I'm reverse engineering systems and trying to
cobble together understanding of how the Mozilla Puppet configs
work and what parts of them can safely be ignored to reproduce an
approximate testing environment.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I finally got access to Mozilla's internal Puppet
repository. This took a few meetings and apparently a lot of
backroom chatter was generated - "developer's don't normally get access,
oh my!" All I wanted was to see how systems are configured so I can
help improve them. Instead, getting access felt like pulling teeth.
This feels like a major roadblock towards productivity, reproducibility,
and testing.</p>
<p>Facebook gives its developers access to most production machines and
trusts them to not be stupid. I know we (Mozilla) like to hold
ourselves to a high standard of security and privacy. But not giving
developers access to the configurations for the systems their code
runs on feels like a very silly policy. I hope Mozilla invests in
opening up this important code and data, if not to the world, at least
to its trusted employees.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully I'll soon have a Vagrant environment that allows
people to build a standalone instance of Mozilla's Mercurial server.
And once that's in place, I can start writing tests that basic services
and workflows (including repository syncing) work as expected. Stay
tuned.</p>
