  <p>Mercurial 3.5 was released today. I contributed some small
improvements to this version that I thought I'd share with the world.</p>
<p>The feature I'm most proud of adding to Mercurial 3.5 is what I'm
referring to as <em>auto share</em>. The existing <em>hg share</em> extension/command
enables multiple checkouts of a repository to share the same backing
repository store. Essentially the <em>.hg/store</em> directory is a symlink
to shared directory. This feature has existed in Mercurial for years
and is essentially identical to the <em>git worktree</em> feature just
recently added in Git 2.5.</p>
<p>My addition to the <em>share</em> extension is the ability for Mercurial to
automatically perform an <em>hg clone</em> + <em>hg share</em> in the same operation.
If the <em>share.pool</em> config option is defined, <em>hg clone</em>
will automatically clone or pull the repository data somewhere inside
the directory pointed to by <em>share.pool</em> then create a new working copy
from that shared location. But here's the magic: <strong>Mercurial can
automatically deduce that different remotes are the same logical
repository (by looking at the root changeset) and automatically have
them share storage</strong>. So if you first <em>hg clone</em> the <em>canonical</em>
repository then later do a <em>hg clone</em> of a <em>fork</em>, Mercurial will
pull down the changesets unique to the fork into the previously
created shared directory and perform a checkout from that. Contrast
with performing a full clone of the fork. <strong>If you are cloning multiple
repositories that are logically derived from the same original one,
this can result in a significant reduction of disk space and network
usage.</strong> I wrote this feature with automated consumers in mind,
particularly continuous integration systems. However, there is also
mode more suitable for humans where repositories are pooled not by their
root changeset but by their URL. For more info, see <em>hg help -e share</em>.</p>
<p>For Mercurial 3.4, I contributed changes that refactored how Mercurial's
tags cache works. This cache was a source of performance problems at
Mozilla's scale for many years. Since upgrading to Mercurial 3.4,
Mozilla has not encountered any significant performance problems with
the cache on either client or server as far as I know.</p>
<p>Building on this work, Mercurial 3.5 supports transferring tags cache
entries from server to client when clients clone/pull. Before, clients
would have to recompute tags cache entries for pulled changesets. On
repositories that are very large in terms of number of files (over 50,000)
or heads (hudreds or more), this could take several dozen seconds or
even minutes. This would manifest as a delay either during or after
initial clone. In Mercurial 3.5 - assuming both client and server
support the new <em>bundle2</em> wire protocol - the cache entries are
transferred from server to client and no extra computation needs to
occur. The client does pay a very small price for transferring this
additional data over the wire, but the payout is almost always worth it.
<strong>For large repositories, this feature means clones are usable sooner.</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a coworker told me that connections to a Mercurial
server were timing out mid clone. We investigated and discovered a
potential for a long CPU-intensive pause during clones where Mercurial
would not touch the network. On this person's under-powered EC2
instance, the pause was so long that the server's inactivity timeout
was triggered and it dropped the client's TCP connection. I refactored
Mercurial's cloning code so there is no longer a pause. There should
be no overall change in clone time, but there is no longer a perceivable
delay between applying changesets and manifests where the network could
remain idle. This investigation also revealed some potential follow-up
work for Mercurial to be a bit smarter about how it interacts with
networks.</p>
<p>Finally, I contributed <em>hg help scripting</em> to Mercurial's help database.
This help topic covers how to use Mercurial from scripting and other
automated environments. It reflects knowledge I've learned from seeing
Mercurial used in automation at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of other changes in Mercurial 3.5. Stay
tuned for another blog post.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Earlier this week, I landed some changes to the Firefox development
environment that aggressively make <em>mach</em> prompt to run <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em>. Full details in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1182677">bug 1182677</a>.</p>
<p>As expected, the change resulted in a fair amount of whining and
bemoaning among various Firefox developers. I wanted to take some time
to explain why we moved forward, even though we knew not everyone would
like the feature.</p>
<p>My official job title at Mozilla is <em>Developer Productivity Engineer</em>.
My job is to make you do your job better.</p>
<p>I've been an employee at Mozilla for four years and in that time I've
witnessed a surprising lack of understanding around version control
tools. (I don't think Mozilla is significantly different from most
other companies here.) I find that a significant number of people
are practicing sub-optimal version control workflows because they don't
know any better (common) or because they are unwilling to change from
learned habits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mercurial is a highly customizable tool. A lot of
Mozillians have spent a lot of time developing useful extensions to
Mercurial that enable Mozillians to use Mercurial more effectively and
to thus become more productive. The latest epic time-saving hack
is <a href="http://www.ncalexander.net/blog/2015/07/02/build-fennec-frontend-fast-with-mach-artifact/">Nick Alexander's work to make Fennec build 80% faster by
having deep integration with version control</a>.</p>
<p><em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is almost
<a href="/blog/2013/07/29/mercurial-setup-wizard-for-firefox-development/">two years old</a>.
Yet, when assisting my fellow Mozillians with Mercurial issues, my
"have you run mach mercurial-setup?" question is still often met with
blank stares followed by "wait, there's a mach mercurial-setup?!" What's
even more frustrating is people wrongly believing that Mercurial can't
do things like rebasing and then spreading misinformation about the
lackings of Mercurial. (Mercurial has many advanced features disabled
out of the box so new users don't footgun themselves.)</p>
<p>Just like Firefox would be irrelevant if it didn't have millions of users,
your awesome tool is mostly irrelevant if you are its only user. That's
why when I hear of someone say they created an amazing tool for
themselves or modified a third party tool without sending the improvements
upstream, my blood pressure rises a little. It rises because here this
person did something awesome and they or some limited subset of people
who happened to be following the person on Twitter or reading their blog
at that point in time managed to a) know about the tool b) take the
effort to install it. The uptake rate is insanely low and return on
investment for that tool is low. It results in duplication of effort.
I find this painfully frustrating because I want everyone to have easy
access to the best tools available. This requires that tools are well
advertised and easy to install and use.</p>
<p>The primary goal of <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is to make it super easy for
anyone to have an optimal Mercurial experience. It was apparent to me that
despite <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> existing, numerous people didn't know it
existed or weren't using it. Your awesome tool isn't very awesome unless
people are using it. And a lot of the awesome tools people have built
around Mercurial at Mozilla weren't being utilized and lots of
productivity wins were thus being unrealized. Forcefully pushing <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em> onto people is thus an attempt to unlock unrealized
productivity wins and to make people happier about the state of their
tools.</p>
<p>I'm not thrilled that mach's prompting to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is
as disruptive as it is. It's bad user experience. I know better. But,
(and this is explained somewhat in the bug), other solutions are more
complicated and have other gotchas. The current, invasive implementation
was the easiest to implement and has the biggest bang for the buck in
terms of adoption. We knew people would complain about it. But from
my perspective, it was do this or do nothing. And nothing hadn't been
very effective. So we did something.</p>
<p>There has been lots of feedback about the change this week. Most
surprising to me is the general sentiment of "I don't want something
automatically changing my hgrc file." I find this surprising because
<em>mach mercurial-setup</em> puts the user firmly in control by prompting
before doing anything, thus respecting user choice and avoiding gotchas
and unwanted changes. It's clear this property needs to be advertised a
bit more so people aren't scared to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> and don't
spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the tool to others. (I also
find it somewhat surprising people would think this in the first place:
I'd like to think we'd implicitly trust most Mozillians to implement
tools that respect user choice and don't do <em>malicious</em> things.)</p>
<p>Like all software, things can and will change. The user experience of
this new feature isn't terrific. We'll iterate on it. If you want to
help enact change, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug in Core :: mach</a>
(for now) and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and your understanding.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As of today, ~15.6% of commits landing in Firefox in July have gone
through <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/">MozReview</a> or have been produced
on machines that have used MozReview. This is still a small percentage
of overall commits. But, signs are that the percentage is going up. Last
month, about half as many commits exhibited the same signature. It's
only July 16 and we've already passed the total from June.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the differences between commits that have
gone through MozReview versus the rest. When you look at the diff
statistics (a quick proxy of change size), we find that MozReview
commits tend to be smaller. The median <em>adds</em> as reported by diff stat
(basically lines that were changed) is 12 for MozReview versus 17
elsewhere. The average is 58 for MozReview versus 100 elsewhere. For
number of files modified, MozReview averages 2.59 versus elsewhere's
2.71. (These numbers exclude some specific large commits that appeared to
be bulk imports of external projects and drove up the non-MozReview
figures.)</p>
<p>It's entirely possible the root cause behind the discrepancy is a
side-effect of the population of MozReview users: perhaps MozReview
users just write smaller commits. However, I'd like to think it's because
MozReview makes it easier to manage multiple commits and people are taking
advantage of that (this is an explicit design goal of MozReview). Whatever
the root cause, I'm glad diffs are smaller.
As I've <a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written about before</a>,
smaller commits are easier to review and land, thus enabling projects to
move faster.</p>
<p>I have a quarterly goal to remove the requirement for a Mozilla LDAP
account to push to MozReview. That will allow first time contributors to
use MozReview. This will be a huge win, as we can do much more magic in
the MozReview world than we can from vanilla Bugzilla (automatic bug
filing, automatic reviewer assignment, etc). Unofficially, I'd like to
have more than 50% of Firefox commits go through MozReview by the end of
the year.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A month ago, I <a href="/blog/2015/05/29/faster-cloning-from-hg.mozilla.org-with-server-provided-bundles/">blogged about faster cloning from hg.mozilla.org using
bundle files</a>.
But deploying the feature on the servers was only the tip of the
iceberg.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Firefox release automation rolled out the
<em>bundleclone</em> extension to their Linux and OS X machines. Essentially,
clones are bootstrapped from Amazon S3 automatically once this extension
is installed.</p>
<p>In just a few days of deployment, we've already seen a drastic shift in
traffic. On UTC day 2015-07-07, S3 served 1,563,014,396,236 bytes of
repository data! The hg.mozilla.org servers themselves served a total of
1,976,057,201,583 bytes.</p>
<p>But we're not done. The <em>bundleclone</em> extension
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1181597">isn't yet deployed on Windows</a>. Nor is it always used on TaskCluster. In addition, there are
still some high-use repositories that don't have bundles being
generated. Yesterday, I crunched the data and
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1181373">enabled bundles on more repositories</a>. It's too early to have conclusive data, but this should
move an additional several hundred gigabytes of traffic to S3.</p>
<p>At Whistler, I said that reducing traffic on hg.mozilla.org by 90% is
within the realm of possibility. Between a partial rollout of S3
clone offload that is already serving 44% of traffic and a
<a href="https://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2015-July/071777.html">feature I'm working on in core Mercurial to enable auto sharing of repository data</a>,
I'd say we're well on track.</p>

  <p>A lot of people contributed some really great feedback about MozReview
at Whistler. One of the most frequent requests was for the ability to
publish submitted review requests without having to open a browser.
I'm pleased to report that as of yesterday, this feature is implemented!
If reviewers have been assigned to all your review requests, Mercurial
will now prompt you to publish the review requests during <em>hg push</em>.
It should <em>just work</em>.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we also introduced more advanced feature
negotiation into the handshake between client and server. This means
we now have a mechanism for detecting out-of-date client installations.
This will enable us to more aggressively drop backwards compatibility
(making server-side development easier) while simultaneously ensuring
that more people are running modern and hopefully better versions of the
client code. This should translate to moving faster and a better
experience for everyone.</p>
