  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The ascendancy of GitHub has very little to do with its namesake tool,
Git.</p>
<p>What GitHub did that was so radical for its time and the strategy that
GitHub continues to execute so well on today is the approach of
putting <em>code first</em> and enabling change to be a frictionless process.</p>
<p>In case you weren't around for the pre-GitHub days or don't remember,
they were not pleasant. Tools around code management were a far cry
from where they are today (I still argue the tools are pretty bad, but
that's for another post). Centralized version control systems were
prevalent (CVS and Subversion in open source, Perforce, ClearCase,
Team Foundation Server, and others in the corporate world). Tools for
looking at and querying code had horrible, ugly interfaces and came out
of a previous era of web design and browser capabilities. It felt like
a chore to do anything, including committing code. Yes, the world
had awesome services like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>,
but they weren't the same as GitHub is today.</p>
<p>Before I get to my central thesis, I want to highlight some supporting
reasons for GitHub's success. There were two developments in the second
half of the 2000s the contributed to the success of GitHub: the rises
of the distributed version control system (DVCS) and the modern web.</p>
<p>While distributed version control systems like Sun WorkShop TeamWare and
BitKeeper existed earlier, it wasn't until the second half of the 2000s
that DVCS systems took off. You can argue part of the reason for this
was open source: my recollection is there wasn't a well-known DVCS
available as free software before 2005. Speaking of 2005, it was a big
year for DVCS projects: Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar all had initial
releases. Suddenly, there were old-but-new ideas on how to do source
control being exposed to new and willing-to-experiment audiences. DVCS
were a critical leap from traditional version control because they
(theoretically) impose less process and workflow limitations on users.
With traditional version control, you needed to be online to commit,
meaning you were managing patches, not commits, in your local
development workflow. There were some forms of branching and merging,
but they were a far cry from what is available today and were often too
complex for mere mortals to use. As more and more people were exposed to
<em>distributed</em> version control, they welcomed its less-restrictive and
more powerful workflows. They realized that source control tools don't
have to be so limiting. <em>Distributed</em> version control also promised all
kinds of revamped workflows that could be harnessed. There were
potential wins all around.</p>
<p>Around the same time that open source DVCS systems were emerging, web
browsers were evolving from an application to render static pages to a
platform for running web <em>applications</em>. Web sites using JavaScript
to dynamically manipulate web page content (DHTML as it was known back
then) were starting to hit their stride. I believe it was GMail that
turned the most heads as to the full power of the <em>modern web</em>
experience, with its novel-for-its-time extreme reliance on
XMLHttpRequest for dynamically changing page content. People were
realizing that powerful, desktop-like applications could be built for
the web and could run everywhere.</p>
<p>GitHub launched in April 2008 standing on the shoulders of both the
emerging interest in the Git content tracking tool and the capabilities
of modern browsers.</p>
<p>I wasn't an early user of GitHub. My recollection is that GitHub was
mostly a Rubyist's playground back then. I wasn't a Ruby programmer, so
I had little reason to use GitHub in the early stages. But people did
start using GitHub. And in the spirit of Ruby (on Rails), GitHub moved
fast, or at least was projecting the notion that they were. While other
services built on top of DVCS tools - like Bitbucket - did exist back then,
GitHub seemed to have momentum associated with it. (Look at the archives
for <a href="https://github.com/blog">GitHub's</a> and
<a href="https://blog.bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket's</a> respective blogs. GitHub has
hundreds of blog entries; Bitbucket numbers in the dozens.) Developers
everywhere up until this point had all been dealing with sub-optimal tools
and workflows. Some of us realized it. Others hadn't. Many of those who
did saw GitHub as a beacon of hope: we have all these new ideas and new
potentials with distributed version control and here is a service under
active development trying to figure out how to exploit that. Oh, and
it's free for open source. Sign me up!</p>
<p>GitHub did capitalize on a market opportunity. They also capitalized on
the value of marketing and the perception that they were moving fast and
providing features that people - especially in open source - wanted.
This captured the early adopters market. But I think what really set
GitHub apart and led to the success they are enjoying today is their
<em>code first</em> approach and their desire to make contribution easy, and
even fun and sociable.</p>
<p>As developers, our job is to solve problems. We often do that by writing
and changing code. And this often involves working as part of a team, or
collaborating. To collaborate, we need tools. You eventually need some
processes. And as I
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">recently blogged</a>,
this can lead to <em>process debt</em> and inefficiencies associated with them.</p>
<p>Before GitHub, the <em>process debt</em> for contributing to other projects was
high. You often had to subscribe to mailing lists in order to submit
patches as emails. Or, you had to create an account on someone's bug
tracker or code review tool before you could send patches. Then you had
to figure out how to use these tools and any organization or
project-specific extensions and workflows attached to them. It was quite
involved and a lot could go wrong. Many projects and organizations (like
Mozilla) still practice this traditional methology. Furthermore (and as
I've
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written before</a>),
these traditional, single patch/commit-based tools often aren't
effective at ensuring the desired output of high quality software.</p>
<p>Before GitHub solved <em>process debt</em> via commoditization of knowledge via
market dominance, they took another approach: emphasizing <em>code first</em>
development.</p>
<p>GitHub is all about the <strong>code</strong>. You load a project page and you see
<strong>code</strong>. You may think a README with basic project information would be
the first thing on a <em>project</em> page. But it isn't. <em>Code</em>, like data,
is king.</p>
<p>Collaboration and contribution on GitHub revolve around the <em>pull
request</em>. It's a way of saying, <em>hey, I made a change, will you take
it?</em> There's nothing too novel in the concept of the <em>pull request</em>:
it's fundamentally no different than sending emails with patches to a
mailing list. But what is so special is GitHub's execution. Gone are
the days of configuring and using one-off tools and processes. Instead,
we have the friendly confines of a clean, friendly, and modern web
experience. While GitHub is built upon the Git tool, you don't even
need to use Git (a tool
<a href="http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">lampooned</a>
for its
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/">horrible usability and approachability</a>)
to contribute on GitHub! Instead, you can
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/">do everything from your browser</a>.
That warrants repeating: <strong>you don't need to leave your browser to
contribute on GitHub</strong>. GitHub has essentially reduced <em>process debt</em>
to <em>edit a text document</em> territory, and pretty much anybody who has
used a computer can do that. This has enabled GitHub to dabble into
non-code territory, such as its
<a href="https://government.github.com/">GitHub and Government</a> initiative to
foster community involvement in government. (GitHub is really a platform
for easily seeing and changing <em>any</em> content or data. But, please, let
me continue using <em>code</em> as a stand-in, since I want to focus on the
developer audience.)</p>
<p>GitHub took an overly-complicated and fragmented world of varying
contribution processes and made the new world revolve around code and a
unified and simple process for change - the <em>pull request</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, there are other reasons for GitHub's success. You can make strong
arguments that GitHub has capitalized on the social and psychological
aspects of coding and human desire for success and happiness. I agree.</p>
<p>You can also argue GitHub succeeded because of Git. That statement is
more or less technically accurate, but I don't think it is a sound
argument. Git may have been the most feature complete open source
DVCS at the time GitHub came into existence. But that doesn't mean there
is something special about Git that no other DVCS has that makes GitHub
popular. Had another tool been more feature complete or had the backing
of a project as large as Linux at the time of GitHub's launch, we could
very well be looking at a successful service built on something that
isn't Git. Git had early market advantage and I argue its popularity
today - a lot of it via GitHub - is largely a result of its early
advantages over competing tools. And, I would go so far to say that when
you consider the poor usability of Git and the pain that its users go
through when first learning it, more accurate statements would be that
<em>GitHub succeeded in spite of Git</em> and <em>Git owes much of its success to
GitHub</em>.</p>
<p>When I look back at the rise of GitHub, I see a service that has
succeeded by putting people first by allowing them to capitalize
on more productive workflows and processes. They've done this by
emphasizing <em>code</em>, not process, as the means for change. Organizations
and projects should take note.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As I was
<a href="/blog/2014/12/30/firefox-source-documentation-versus-mdn/">playing around with source-derived documentation</a>,
I grasped the reality that any attempt to move documentation out of
MDN's wiki and into something derived from source code (despite the
argued technical and quality advantages) would likely be met with fierce
opposition because the change process for Firefox is much more involved
than <em>edit a wiki</em>.</p>
<p>This observation casts light on something important: <strong>the very act of
contributing <em>any</em> change to Firefox is too damn hard.</strong></p>
<p>I've always believed this statement to be true. I even like to think I'm
one of the few people that has consistently tried to do something about
it (inventing mach, overhauling the build system, bootstrap scripting,
MozReview, etc). But I, like many of the seasoned Firefox developers,
often lose sight of this grim reality. (I think it's fair to say that
new contributors often complain about the development experience and
as we grow accustomed to it, the complaint volume and intensity wanes).</p>
<p><strong>But when you have the simplicity of editing a wiki page on MDN juxtaposed
against the Firefox change contribution process of today, the inefficiency
of the Firefox process is clearly seen.</strong></p>
<p>The amount of knowledge required to change Firefox is obscenely absurd. Sure,
some complex components will always be difficult to change. But I'm talking
about <em>any</em> component: the base set of knowledge required to contribute
<em>any</em> change to Firefox is vast. This is <strong>before</strong> we get into any
domain-specific knowledge inside Firefox. <strong>I have always believed and
will continue to believe that this is a grave institutional issue for
Mozilla.</strong> It should go without saying that I believe this is an issue worth
addressing. After all, <strong>any piece of knowledge required for
contribution is essentially an obstacle to completion. Elimination of
required knowledge lowers the barrier to contribution.</strong> This, in turn,
allows increased contribution via more and faster change. This advances
the quality and relevance of Firefox, which enables Mozilla to advance
its <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">Mission</a>.</p>
<p>Seasoned contributors have probably internalized most of the knowledge
required to contribute to Firefox. Here is a <strong>partial</strong> list to remind

</ul>

<p>Holy #$%@, that's a lot of knowledge. Not only is this list incomplete,
it's also not encompassing a lot of the domain-specific knowledge around
the content being changed.</p>
<p>Every item on this list represents a point where a potential contributor
could throw up their arms out of despair and walk away, giving their
time and talents to another project. Every item on this list that takes
10 minutes instead of 5 could be the tipping point. For common actions,
things that take 5 seconds instead of 1 could be the difference maker.
<strong>This list thus represents reasons that people do not contribute to
Firefox or contribute ineffectively (in the case of common contributors,
like paid Mozilla staff).</strong></p>
<p>I view items on this list as <strong>process debt</strong>. <em>Process debt</em> is a term
I'm coining (perhaps someone has beat me to it - I'm writing this on a
plane without Internet access) that is a sibling of <em>technical debt</em>.
<em>Process debt</em> is overhead and inefficiency associated with <em>processes</em>.
The border between <em>process debt</em> and <em>technical debt</em> in computers is
the code itself (although that border may sometimes not be very
well-defined, as code and process are oftentimes similar, such as most
interactions with version control or code review tools).</p>
<p>When I see this list of <em>process debt</em>, I'm inspired by the opportunity
to streamline the processes and bask in the efficiency gains. But I am
also simultaneously overwhelmed by the vast scope of things that need
improved. When I think about the amount of energy that will need to be
exerted to fight the <em>OMG change</em> crowd, the list becomes <em>depressing</em>.
But discussing institutional resistance to change, the <em>stop energy</em>
associated with it, and Mozilla's historical record of failing to invest
in fixing process (and technical) debt is for another post.</p>
<p>When looking at the above list, I can think of the following general
ways to make it more approachable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove an item completely. If it isn't on the list, there is nothing
   to know and no overhead. The best way to solve a problem is to make
   it not exist.</li>
<li>Automate an item and makes its existence largely transparent. If an
   item is invisible, does it exist in the mind of a contributor? (This
   is also known as solving the problem by adding a layer of
   indirection.)</li>
<li>Change an item so that it is identical to another, more familiar
   process. If you use a well-defined process, there is no new knowledge
   that must be learned and the cost of on-boarding someone already
   familiar with that knowledge is practically zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you start staring at this list of Firefox contribution process debt,
you start thinking about priorities, groupings, and strategies. You look
around at what others are doing to see if you can borrow good ideas.</p>
<p>I've done a lot of thinking on the subject and have some ideas and
recommendations. Stay tuned for some additional posts on the topic.</p>

  <p>Starting today and continuing through next week, there will be a number
of styling changes made to <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the work is to bring the style up-to-date with upstream
Mercurial. This will result in more features being available to the web
interface, hopefully making it more useful. This includes display of
bookmarks and the Mercurial help documentation. As part of this work,
we're also removing some files on the server that shouldn't be used. If
you start getting 404s or notice an unexpected theme change, this is
probably the reason why.</p>
<p>If you'd like to look over the changes before they are made or would
like to file a bug against a regression (we suspect there will be
minor regressions due to the large nature of the changes), head on
over to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1117021">bug 1117021</a>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org">hg.mozilla.org</a> - Mozilla's Mercurial server -
has functionality called the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/pushlog.html">pushlog</a>
which records who pushed what when. Essentially, it's a log of when
a repository was changed. This is separate from the commit log because
the commit log can be spoofed and the commit log doesn't record when
commits were actually pushed.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the pushlog has suffered from data consistency
issues. If you aborted the push at a certain time, data was not inserted
in the pushlog. If you aborted the push at another time, data existed in
the pushlog but not in the repository (the repository would get rolled
back but the pushlog data wouldn't).</p>
<p><strong>I'm pleased to announce that the pushlog is now robust against
interruptions and its updates are consistent with what is recorded by
Mercurial.</strong> The pushlog database commit/rollback is tied to Mercurial's
own transaction API. What Mercurial does to the push transaction, the
pushlog follows.</p>
<p>This former inconsistency has caused numerous problems over the years.
When data was inconsistent, we often had to close trees until someone
could SSH into the machines and manually run SQL to fix the problems.
This also contributed to a culture of <em>don't press ctrl+c during push:
it could corrupt Mercurial.</em> (Ctrl+c should be safe to press any time: if
it isn't, there is a bug to be filed.)</p>
<p>Any time you remove a source of tree closures is a cause for celebration.
Please join me in celebrating your new freedom to abort pushes without
concern for data inconsistency.</p>
<p>In case you want to test things out, aborting pushes and (and rolling
back the pushlog) should now result in something like:</p>
<pre><code>pushing to ssh://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
searching for changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
Trying to insert into pushlog.
Inserted into the pushlog db successfully.
^C
rolling back pushlog
transaction abort!
rollback completed
</code></pre>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The Firefox source tree has had in-tree documentation powered by
<a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Sphinx</a> for a while now.
However, its canonical home has been a
<a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/mozilla-central-docs/Tree_Documentation/index.html">hard-to-find URL on ci.mozilla.org</a>.
I finally <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115278">scratched an itch</a>
and wrote patches to enable the docs to be built easier. So,
starting today, the docs are now available on Read the Docs at
<a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">https://gecko.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a>!</p>
<p>While I was scratching itches, I decided to play around with another
documentation-related task: automatic API documentation. I have a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115452">limited proof-of-concept for automatically generating XPIDL interface
documentation</a>.
Essentially, we use the in-tree XPIDL parser to parse <em>.idl</em> files and
turn the Python object representation into reStructured Text, which Sphinx
parses and renders into pretty HTML for us. The concept can be applied to any
source input, such as WebIDL and JavaScript code. I chose XPIDL because a
parser is readily available and I know Joshua Cranmer has expressed
interest in automatic XPIDL documentation generation. (As an aside,
JavaScript tooling that supports the flavor of JavaScript used
internally by Firefox is very limited. We need to prioritize removing
Mozilla extensions to JavaScript if we ever want to start using awesome
tooling that exists in the wild.)</p>
<p>As I was implementing this proof-of-concept, I was looking at XPIDL
interface documentation on MDN to see how things are presented today.
After perusing MDN for a bit and comparing its content against what I
was able to derive from the source, something became extremely clear:
MDN has significantly more content than the canonical source code.
Obviously the <em>.idl</em> files document the interfaces, their attributes,
their methods, and all the types and names in between: that's the very
definition of an IDL. But what was generally missing from the source
code is comments. <em>What does this method do?</em> <em>What is each argument
used for?</em> Things like example usage are almost non-existent in the
source code. MDN, by contrast, typically has no shortage of all these
things.</p>
<p>As I was grasping the reality that MDN has a lot of out-of-tree
supplemental content, I started asking myself <em>what's the point
in automatic API docs? Is manual document curation on MDN good
enough?</em> <strong>This question has sort of been tearing me apart.</strong> Let me try
to explain.</p>
<p>MDN is an amazing site. You can tell a lot of love has gone into making
the experience and much of its content excellent. However, the content
around the technical implementation / internals of Gecko/Firefox generally
sucks. There are some exceptions to the rule. But I find that things like
internal API documentation to be lackluster on average. It is rare for
me to find documentation that is up-to-date and useful. It is common to
find documentation that is partial and incomplete. It is very common to
find things like JSMs not documented at all. <strong>I think this is a
problem.</strong> I argue the lack of good documentation raises the barrier to
contributing. <strong>Furthermore, writing and maintaining excellent
low-level documentation is too much effort.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My current thoughts on API and low-level documentation are that I
question the value of this documentation existing on MDN.</strong>
Specifically, I think things like JSM API docs
(like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Sqlite.jsm">Sqlite.jsm</a>)
and XPIDL interface documentation (like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIFile">nsIFile</a>)
don't belong on MDN - at least not in wiki form. <strong>Instead, I believe
that documentation like this should live in and be derived from source
code.</strong> Now, if the MDN site wants to expose this as read-only content
or if MDN wants to enable the content to be annotated in a wiki-like
manner (like how MSDN and PHP documentation allow user comments), that's
perfectly fine by me. Here's why.</p>
<p>First, if I must write separate-from-source-code API documentation on
MDN (or any other platform for that matter), I must now perform extra
work or forgo either the source code or external documentation. In other
words, if I write in-line documentation in the source code, I must spend
extra effort to essentially copy large parts of that to MDN. And I must
continue to spend extra effort to keep updates in sync. If I don't
want to spend that extra effort (I'm as lazy as you), I have to choose
between documenting the source code or documenting MDN. If I choose the
source code, people either have to read the source to read the docs
(because we don't generate documentation from source today) or someone
else has to duplicate the docs (overall more work). If I choose to
document on MDN, then people reading the source code (probably because
they want to change it) are deprived of additional context useful to
make that process easier. <strong>This is a lose-lose scenario and it is a
general waste of expensive people time.</strong></p>
<p>Second, I prefer having API documentation derived from source code
because I feel it results in more accurate documentation that has the
higher liklihood of remaining accurate and in sync with reality. Think
about it: when was the last time you reviewed changes to a JSM and
searched MDN for content that needed updated? I'm sure there are some
pockets of people that do this right. But I've written dozens of
JavaScript patches for Firefox and I'm pretty sure I've been asked to
update <em>external</em> documentation less than 5% of the time. Inline source
documentation, however, is another matter entirely. Because the
documentation is often proximal to code that changed, I frequently a) go
ahead and make the documentation changes because everything is right there
and it's low overhead to change as I adjust the source b) am asked to
update in-line docs when a reviewer sees I forgot to. Generally
speaking, things tend to stay in sync and fewer bugs form when
everything is proximally located. By fragmenting documentation between
source code and external services like MDN, we increase the liklihood
that things become out of sync. This results in misleading information
and increases the barriers to contribution and change. In other words,
developer inefficiency.</p>
<p>Third, having API documentation derived from source code opens up
numerous possibilities to further aid developer productivity and improve
the usefullness of documentation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can parse <em>@param</em> references out of documentation and issue
  warnings/errors when documentation doesn't match the AST.</li>
<li>We can issue warnings when code isn't documented.</li>
<li>We can include in-line examples and execute and verify these as part
  of builds/tests.</li>
<li>We can more easily cross-reference APIs because everything is
  documented consistently. We can also issue warnings when
  cross-references no longer work.</li>
<li>We can derive files so editors and IDEs can display in-line API docs
  as you type or can complete functions as you type, allowing people to
  code faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we don't generally do these things today, they are all within the
realm of possibility. Sphinx supports doing many of these things. Stop
reading and run <em>mach build-docs</em> right now and look at the warnings
from malformed documentation. I don't know about you, but I love when my
tools tell me when I'm creating a burden for others.</p>
<p>There really is so much more we could be doing with source-derived
documentation. And I argue managing it would take less overall work and
would result in higher quality documentation.</p>
<p>But the world of source-derived documentation isn't all roses. MDN has a
very important advantage: it's a wiki. Just log in, edit in a WYSIWYG,
and save. It's so easy. The moment we move to source-derived
documentation, we introduce the massive Firefox source repository, the
Firefox code review process, bugs/Bugzilla, version control overhead
(although versioning documentation is another plus for source-derived
documentation), landing changes, extra cost to Mozilla for building and
running those checkins (even if they contain docs-only changes, sadly),
and the time and cognitive burden associated with each one. That's a
lot of extra work compared to clicking a few buttons on MDN! <strong>Moving
documentation editing out of MDN and into the Firefox patch submission
world would be a step in the wrong direction in terms of fostering
contributions.</strong> Should someone really have to go through all that just
to correct a typo? I have no doubt we'd lose contributors if we switched
the change contribution process. And considering our lackluster track
record of writing inline documentation in source, I don't feel great
about losing <em>any</em> person who contributes documentation, no matter how
small the contribution.</p>
<p>And this is my dilemma: the existing source-or-MDN solution is sub-par
for pretty much everything except ease of contribution on MDN and
deploying nice tools (like Sphinx) to address the suckitude will result
in more difficulty contributing. Both alternatives suck.</p>
<p>I intend to continue this train of thought in a subsequent post. Stay
tuned.</p>
