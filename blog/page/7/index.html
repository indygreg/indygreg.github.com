  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When Firefox made the switch from CVS to Mercurial in March 2007, the
CVS history wasn't imported into Mercurial. There were good reasons for
this at the time. But it's a decision that continues to have
side-effects. I am surprised how often I hear of engineers wanting to
access blame and commit info from commits now more than 9 years old!</p>
<p>When individuals created a Git mirror of the Firefox repository a few
years ago, they correctly decided that importing CVS history would be
a good idea. They also correctly decided to combine the logically same
but physically separate <em>release</em> and <em>integration</em> repositories into a
unified Git repository. These are things we can't easily do to the
canonical Mercurial repository because it would break SHA-1 hashes,
breaking many systems, and it would require significant changes in
process, among other reasons.</p>
<p>While Firefox developers do have access to a single Firefox repository
with full CVS history (the Git mirror), they still aren't satisfied.</p>
<p>Running <em>git blame</em> (or <em>hg blame</em> for that matter) can be very
expensive. For this reason, the blame interface is disabled on many
web-based source viewers by default. On GitHub, some blame URLs for
the Firefox repository time out and cause GitHub to display an error
message. No matter how hard you try, you can't easily get blame results
(running a local Git HTTP/HTML interface is still difficult compared to
<em>hg serve</em>).</p>
<p>Another reason developers aren't satisfied with the Git mirror is that
Git's querying tools pale in comparison to Mercurial's. I've said it
before and I'll say it again: Mercurial's revision sets and templates
are incredibly useful features that enable advanced repository querying
and reporting. Git's offerings come nowhere close. (I <em>really</em> wish Git
would steal these awesome features from Mercurial.)</p>
<p>Anyway, enough people were complaining about the lack of a Mercurial
Firefox repository with full CVS history that I decided to create one.
If you point your browsers or Mercurial clients to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full">https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-full</a>,
you'll be able to access it.</p>
<p>The process used for the conversion was the simplest possible: I used
hg-git to convert the Git mirror back to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Unlike the Git mirror, I didn't include all heads in this new
repository. Instead, there is only mozilla-central's head (the current
development tip). If I were doing this properly, I'd include all heads,
like
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/gszorc_mozilla.com/gecko-aggregate">gecko-aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>I'm well aware there are oddities in the Git mirror and they now
exist in this new repository as well. My goal for this conversion was to
deliver something: it wasn't a goal to deliver the most correct result
possible.</p>
<p>At this time, this repository should be considered an unstable science
experiment. <strong>By no means should you rely on this repository.</strong> But if
you find it useful, I'd appreciate hearing about it. If enough people
ask, we could probably make this more official.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="http://git-merge.com/">Git Merge 2015</a> was a Git user conference held
in Paris on April 8 and 9, 2015.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a version control geek. I'm also responsible for a large
part of Mozilla's version control hosting. So, when the videos were
made public, you can bet I took interest.</p>
<p>This post contains my notes from a few of the Git Merge talks. I try
to separate content/facts from my opinions by isolating my opinions
(within parenthesis).</p>
<h2>Git at Google</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/git-at-google-dave-borowitz.html">Git at Google: Making Big Projects (and everyone else) Happy</a>
is from a Googler (Dave Borowitz) who works on JGit for the Git
infrastructure team at Google.</p>
<p>"Everybody in this room is going to feel some kind of pain working with
Git at scale at some time in their career."</p>
<p>First Git usage at Google in 2008 for Android. 2011 googlesource.com
launches.</p>
<p>24,000 total Git repos at Google. 77.1M requests/day. 30-40 TB/day. 2-3
Gbps.</p>
<p>Largest repo is 210GB (not public it appears).</p>
<p>800 repos in AOSP. Google maintains internal fork of all Android repos
(so they can throw stuff over the wall). Fresh AOSP tree is 17 GiB. Lots
of contracts dictating access.</p>
<p>Chrome repos include Chromium, Blink, Chromium OS. Performed giant
Subversion migration. Developers of Chrome very set in their ways. Had
many workflows integrated with Subversion web interface. Subversion
blame was fast, Git blame slow. Built caching backend for Git blame to
make developers happy.</p>
<p>Chromium 2.9 GiB, 3.6M objects, 390k commits. Blink 5.3 GiB, 3.1M
objects, 177k commits. They merged them into a monorepo. Mention of
Facebook's monorepo talk and Mercurial scaling efforts for a repo larger
then Chromium/Blink monorepo. Benefits to developers for doing atomic
refactorings, etc.</p>
<p>"Being big is hard."</p>
<p>AOSP: 1 Gbps -&gt; 2 minutes for 17 GiB. 20 Mbps -&gt; 3 hours. Flaky internet
combined with non-resumable clone results in badness. Delta resolution
can take a while. Checkout of hundreds of thousands of files can be
slow, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>"As tool developers... it's hard to tell people don't check in large
binaries, do things this way, ... when all they are trying to do is
get their job done." (I couldn't agree more: tools should ideally not
impose sub-optimal workflows.)</p>
<p>They prefer scaling pain to supporting multiple tools. (I think this
meant don't use multiple VCSs if you can just make one scale.)</p>
<p>Shallow clone beneficial. But some commands don't work. log not very
useful.</p>
<p>Narrow clones mentioned. Apparently talked about elsewhere at Git Merge
not captured on video. Non-trivial problem for Git. "We have no idea
when this is going to happen."</p>
<p>Split repos until narrow clone is available. Google wrote repo to manage
multiple repos. They view repo and multiple repos as stop-gap until
narrow clone is implemented.</p>
<p>git submodule needs some love. Git commands don't handle submodules
or multiple repos very well. They'd like to see repo features
incorporated into git submodule.</p>
<p>Transition to server operation.</p>
<p>Pre-2.0, counting objects was hard. For Linux kernel, 60s 100% CPU time
per clone to count objects. "Linux isn't even that big."</p>
<p>Traditionally Git is single homed. Load from users. Load from
automation.</p>
<p>Told anecdote about how Google's automation once recloned the repo after
a failed Git command. Accidentally made a change one day that caused a
command to persistently fail. DoS against server. (We've had this at
Mozilla.)</p>
<p>Garbage collection on server is CPU intensive and necessary. Takes cores
away from clients.</p>
<p>Reachability bitmaps implemented in JGit, ported to Git 2.0. Counting
objects for Linux clones went from 60s CPU to ~100ms.</p>
<p>Google puts static, pre-generated bundles on a CDN. Client downloads
bundle then does incremental fetch. Massive reduction in server load.
Bundle files better for users. Resumable.</p>
<p>They have ideas for integrating bundles into git fetch, but it's
"a little way's off." (This feature is partially implemented in
Mercurial 3.4 and we have plans for using it at Mozilla.) It's feature
in repo today.</p>
<p>Shared filesystem would be really nice to spread CPU load. NFS "works."
Performance problems with high throughput repositories.</p>
<p>Master-mirror replication can help. Problems with replication lag.
Consistency is hard.</p>
<p>Google uses a distributed Git store using Bigtable and GFS built on
JGit. Git-aware load balancer. Completely separate pool of garbage
collection workers. They do replication to multiple datacenters before
pushes. 6 datacenters across world. Some of their stuff is open source.
A lot isn't.</p>
<p>Humans have difficulty managing hundreds of repositories. "How do you as
a human know what you need to modify?" Monorepos have this problem too.
Inherent with lots of content. (Seemed to imply it is worse with
multiple repos than with a monorepo.)</p>
<p>Porting changes between forks is hard. e.g. cherry picking between
internal and external Android repos.</p>
<p>ACLs are a mess.</p>
<p>Google built Gerrit code review. It does ACLs, auto rebasing, release
branch management. It's a swiss army knife. (This aligns with my
vision for MozReview and code-centric development.)</p>
<h2>Scaling Git at Twitter</h2>
<p>Wilhelm Bierbaum from Twitter talks about
<a href="http://git-merge.com/videos/scaling-git-at-twitter-wilhelm-bierbaum.html">Scaling Git at Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"We've decided it's really important to make Twitter a good place to work for
developers. Source control is one of those points where we were
lacking. We had some performance problems with Git in the past."</p>
<p>Twitter runs a monorepo. Used to be 3 repos. "Working with a single
repository is the way they prefer to develop software when developing
hundreds of services." They also have a single build system. They have
a geo diverse workforce.</p>
<p>They use normal canonical implementation of Git + some optimizations.</p>
<p>Benefits of a monorepo:</p>
<p>Visibility. Easier for people to find code in one repo. Code search tools
tailored towards single repos.</p>
<p>Single toolchain. single set of tools to build, test, and deploy. When
improvements to tools made, everyone benefits because one toolchain.</p>
<p>Easy to share code (particularly generated code like IDL). When operating
many small services, services developed together. Code duplication is
minimized. Twitter relies on IDL heavily.</p>
<p>Simpler to predict the impact of your changes. Easier to look at single
code base then to understand how multiple code bases interact. Easy to
make a change and see what breaks rather than submit changes to N repos
and do testing in N repos.</p>
<p>Makes refactoring less arduous.</p>
<p>Surfaces architecture issues earlier.</p>
<p>Breaking changes easier to coordinate</p>
<p>Drawbacks of monorepos:</p>
<p>Large disk footprint for full history.</p>
<p>Tuning filesystem only goes so far.</p>
<p>Forces some organizations to adopt sparse checkouts and shallow clones.</p>
<p>Submodules aren't good enough to use. <em>add</em> and <em>commit</em> don't recognize
submodule boundaries very well and aren't very usable.</p>
<p>"To us, using a tool such as repo that is in effect a secondary version
control tool on top of Git does not feel right and doesn't lead to a
fluid experience."</p>
<p>Twitter has centralized use of Git. Don't really benefit from
distributed version control system. Feature branches. Goal is to live as
close to master as possible. Long-running branches discouraged. Fewer
conflicts to resolve.</p>
<p>They have project-level ownership system. But any developer can change
anything.</p>
<p>They have lots of read-only replicas. Highly available writable server.</p>
<p>They use reference repos heavily so object exchange overhead is
manageable.</p>
<p>Scaling issues with many refs. Partially due to how refs are stored on
disk. File locking limits in OS. Commands like status, add, and commit
can be slow, even with repo garbage collected and packed. Locking issues
with garbage collection.</p>
<p>Incorporated file alteration monitor to make status faster. Reference to
Facebook's work on watchman and its Mercurial integration. Significant
impact on OS X. "Pretty much all our developers use OS X." (I assume
they are using Watchman with Git - I've seen patches for this on the Git
mailing list but they haven't been merged into core yet.)</p>
<p>They implemented a custom index format. Adopted faster hashing
algorithm that uses native instructions.</p>
<p>Discovery with many refs didn't scale. 13 MB of raw data for refs
exchange at Twitter. (!!) Experimenting with clients sending a bloom
filter of refs. Hacked it together via HTTP header.</p>
<p>Fetch protocol is expensive. Lots of random I/O. Can take minutes
to do incremental fetches. Bitmap indices help, but aren't good enough
for them. Since they have central and well-defined environment, they
changed fetch protocol to work like a journal: send all changed data since
client's last fetch. Server work is essentially a sendfile system call.
git push appends push packs to a log-structured journal. On fetch,
clients "replay" the transactions from the journal. Similar to MySQL
binary log replication. (This is very similar to some of the Mercurial
replication work I'm doing at Mozilla. Yay technical validation.)
(Append only files are also how Mercurial's storage model works by
default.)</p>
<p>Log-structured data exchange means server side is cheap. They can insert
HTTP caches to handle Range header aware requests.</p>
<p>Without this hack, they can't scale their servers.</p>
<p>Initial clone is seeded by BitTorrent.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone's unmerged feature branches are on the one
central repo and get transferred everywhere by default. Their journal
fetch can selectively fetch refs so this isn't a huge problem.</p>
<p>They'd like to experiment with sparse repos. But they haven't gotten to
that yet. They'd like a better storage abstraction in Git to enable
necessary future scalability. They want a network-aware storage backend.
Local objects not necessary if the network has them.</p>
<p>They are running a custom Git distribution/fork on clients. But they
don't want to maintain forever. Prefer to send upstream.</p>

  <p>As of a few minutes ago, we explicitly dropped support for Mercurial 3.0
for all the Mercurial code in the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools">version-control-tools</a>
repository. File issues in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1162304">bug 1162304</a>.</p>
<p>Code may still work against Mercurial 3.0. But it isn't supported and
could break hard at any time.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple versions of <em>any</em> software carries
with it some cost. The people writing tooling around Mercurial are busy.
It is a waste of our time to bend over backwards to support old versions
of software that <strong>all</strong> users should have upgraded from months ago.
Still using older Mercurial versions means you aren't getting the best
performance and may encounter bugs that have since been fixed.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mozilla tailored Mercurial installation instructions</a>

  <p>I semi-frequently stumble upon conversations in hallways and
on irc.mozilla.org about issues people are having with Mercurial.
These conversations periodically involve a legitimate bug with
Mercurial. Unfortunately, these conversations frequently end
without an actionable result. Unless someone files a bug, pings me,
etc, the complaints disappear into ether. That's not good for
anyone and only results in bugs living longer than they should.</p>
<p>There are posters around Mozilla offices that say
<em>if you see something, file something.</em> This advice does not just
apply to Mozilla projects!</p>
<p><strong>If you encounter an issue in Mercurial, please take the time
to report it somewhere meaningful.</strong> The
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/issues.html">Reporting Issues with Mercurial</a>
page from the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/index.html">Mercurial for Mozillians</a>
guide tells you how to do this.</p>
<p>It is OK to complain about something. But if you don't inform
someone empowered to do something about it, you are part of the
problem without being part of the solution. Please make the
incremental effort to be part of the solution.</p>

 | <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2015/05/04/mercurial-3.4-released#disqus_thread">View Comments</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.4 was released on May 1 (following Mercurial's time-based
schedule of releasing a new version every 3 months).</p>
<p>3.4 is a significant release for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the next version of the wire protocol (<em>bundle2</em>) has been
marked as non-experimental on servers. This version of the protocol
paves over a number of deficiencies in the classic protocol. I won't
go into low-level details. But I will say that the protocol enables
some rich end-user experiences, such as having the server hand out URLs
for pre-generated bundles (e.g. offload clones to S3), atomic push
operations, and advanced workflows, such as having the server rebase
automatically on push. Of course, you'll need a server running 3.4
to realize the benefits of the new protocol. hg.mozilla.org won't be
updated until at least June 1.</p>
<p>Second, Mercurial 3.4 contains improvements to the tags cache to make
performance concerns a thing of the past. Due to the structure of the
Firefox repositories, the previous implementation of the tags cache
could result in pauses of dozens of seconds during certain workflows.
The problem should go away with Mercurial 3.4. <strong>Please note that on
first use of Mercurial 3.4, your repository may perform a one-time
upgrade of the tags cache. This will spin a full CPU core and will
take up to a few minutes to complete on Firefox repos. Let it run to
completion and performance should not be an issue again.</strong> I wrote the
patches to change the tags cache (with lots of help from Pierre-Yves
David, a Mercurial core contributor). So if you find anything wrong,
I'm the one to complain to.</p>
<p>Third, the HTTP interface to Mercurial (hgweb) now has JSON output
for nearly every endpoint. The implementation isn't yet complete,
but it is better than nothing. But, it should be good enough for
services to start consuming it. Again, this won't be available on
hg.mozilla.org until the server is upgraded on June 1 at the earliest.
This is a feature I added to core Mercurial. If you have feature
requests, send them my way.</p>
<p>Fourth, a number of performance regressions introduced in Mercurial
3.3 were addressed. These performance issues frequently manifested
during <em>hg blame</em> operations. Many Mozillians noticed them on
hg.mozilla.org when looking at blame through the web interface.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive list of changes, see
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.version-control/z4aWvBoAGYw/d0hUGKJU_psJ">my post about the 3.4 RC</a>
and the
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_3.4_.282015-05-01.29">official release notes</a>.</p>
<p>3.4 was a significant release. There are compelling reasons to upgrade.
That being said, there were a lot of changes in 3.4. If you want to wait
until 3.4.1 is released (scheduled for June 1) so you don't run into
any regressions, nobody can fault you for that.</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, I recommend reading the
<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mercurial for Mozillians Installation Page</a>.</p>
