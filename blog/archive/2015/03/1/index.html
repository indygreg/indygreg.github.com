  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Any time Facebook talks about technical matters I tend to listen.
They have a track record of demonstrating engineering leadership
in several spaces. And, unlike many companies that just talk, Facebook
often gives others access to those ideas via source code and healthy
open source projects. It's rare to see a company operating on the
frontier of the computing field provide so much insight into their
inner workings. You can gain so much by riding their cotails and
following their lead instead of clinging to and cargo culting from
the past.</p>
<p>The Facebook F8 developer conference was this past week. All the
talks are <a href="https://developers.facebooklive.com/">now available online</a>.
<strong>I encourage you to glimpse through the list of talks and watch
whatever is relevant to you.</strong> There's really a little bit for
everyone.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to me is the
<a href="https://developers.facebooklive.com/videos/561/big-code-developer-infrastructure-at-facebook-s-scale">Big Code: Developer Infrastructure at Facebook's Scale</a>
talk. This is highly relevant to my job role as Developer Productivity
Engineer at Mozilla.</p>
<p>My notes for this talk follow.</p>
<p><strong>"We don't want humans waiting on computers. We want computers waiting
on humans."</strong> (This is the common theme of the talk.)</p>
<p>In 2005, Facebook was on Subversion. In 2007 moved to Git. Deployed
a bridge so people worked in Git and had distributed workflow but
pushed to Subversion under the hood.</p>
<p>New platforms over time. Server code, iOS, Android. One Git repo
per platform/project -&gt; 3 Git repos. Initially no code sharing, so
no problem. Over time, code sharing between all repos. Lots of code
copying and confusion as to what is where and who owns what.</p>
<p>Facebook is mere weeks away from completing their migration to
consolidate the big three repos to a Mercurial monorepo. (See also
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">my post about monorepos</a>.)</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easier code sharing.</li>
<li>Easier large-scale changes. Rewrite the universe at once.</li>
<li>Unified set of tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook employees run &gt;1M source control commands per day. &gt;100k
commits per week. VCS tool needs to be fast to prevent distractions
and context switching, which slow people down.</p>
<p>Facebook implemented sparse checkout and shallow history in Mercurial.
Necessary to scale distributed version control to large repos.</p>
<p><strong>Quote from Google: "We're excited about the work Facebook is doing with
Mercurial and glad to be collaborating with Facebook on Mercurial
development."</strong> (Well, I guess the cat is finally out of the bag:
Google is working on Mercurial. This was kind of an open secret for
months. But I guess now it is official.)</p>
<p>Push-pull-rebase bottleneck: if you rebase and push and someone beats
you to it, you have to pull, rebase, and try again. This gets worse
as commit rate increases and people do needless legwork. <strong>Facebook
has moved to server-side rebasing on push</strong> to mostly eliminate this
pain point. (This is part of a still-experimental feature in Mercurial,
which should hopefully lose its experimental flag soon.)</p>
<p>Starting 13:00 in we have a speaker change and move away from version
control.</p>
<p>IDEs don't scale to Facebook scale. <strong>"Developing in Xcode at Facebook
is an exercise in frustration."</strong> On average 3.5 minutes to open
Facebook for iOS in Xcode. 5 minutes on average to index. Pegs CPU
and makes not very responsive. 50 Xcode crashes per day across all
Facebook iOS developers.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook measures everything about tools. Mercurial operation times.
Xcode times. Build times. Data tells them what tools and workflows
need to be worked on.</strong></p>
<p>Facebook believes IDEs are worth the pain because they make people
more productive.</p>
<p>Facebook wants to support all editors and IDEs since people want to
use whatever is most comfortable.</p>
<p>React Native changed things. Supported developing on multiple
platforms, which no single IDE supports. People launched several
editors and tools to do React Native development. People needed 4
windows to do development. That experience was "not acceptable."
So they built their own IDE. Set of plugins on top of ATOM. Not
a fork. They like hackable and web-y nature of ATOM.</p>
<p>The demo showing iOS development looks very nice! Doing Objective-C,
JavaScript, simulator integration, and version control in one window!</p>
<p>It can connect to remote servers and transparently save and
deploy changes. It can also get real-time compilation errors and hints
from the remote server! (Demo was with Hack. Not sure if others langs
supported. Having beefy central servers for e.g. Gecko development
would be a fun experiment.)</p>
<p>Starting at 32:00 presentation shifts to continuous integration.</p>
<p>Number one goal of CI at Facebook is developer efficiency. <strong>We
don't want developers waiting on computers to build and test diffs.</strong></p>
<p>3 goals for CI:</p>
<ol>
<li>High-signal feedback. Don't want developers chasing failures that
   aren't their fault. Wastes time.</li>
<li>Must provide rapid feedback. Developers don't want to wait.</li>
<li>Provide frequent feedback. Developers should know as soon as
   possible after they did something. (I think this refers to local
   feedback.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sandcastle is their CI system.</p>
<p>Diff lifecycle discussion.</p>
<p>Basic tests and lint run locally. (My understanding from talking
with Facebookers is "local" often means on a Facebook server, not
local laptop. Machines at developers fingertips are often dumb
terminals.)</p>
<p>They appear to use code coverage to determine what tests to run.
"We're not going to run a test unless your diff might actually have
broken it."</p>
<p>They run flaky tests less often.</p>
<p>They run slow tests less often.</p>
<p><strong>Goal is to get feedback to developers in under 10 minutes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If they run fewer tests and get back to developers quicker,
things are less likely to break than if they run more tests but
take longer to give feedback.</strong></p>
<p>They also want feedback quickly so reviewers can see results at
review time.</p>
<p>They use Web Driver heavily. Love cross-platform nature of Web Driver.</p>
<p>In addition to test results, performance and size metrics are reported.</p>
<p>They have a "Ship It" button on the diff.</p>
<p>Landcastle handles landing diff.</p>
<p>"It is not OK at Facebook to land a diff without using Landcastle."
(Read: developers don't push directly to the master repo.)</p>
<p>Once Landcastle lands something, it runs tests again. If an issue
is found, a task is filed. Task can be "push blocking."
Code won't ship to users until the "push blocking" issue resolved.
(Tweets confirm they do backouts "fairly aggressively." A valid
resolution to a push blocking task is to backout. But fixing forward
is fine as well.)</p>
<p>After a while, branch cut occurs. Some cherry picks onto release
branches.</p>
<p>In addition to diff-based testing, they do continuous testing runs.
Much more comprehensive. No time restrictions. Continuous runs on
master and release candidate branches. Auto bisect to pin down
regressions.</p>
<p>Sandcastle processes &gt;1000 test results per second. 5 years of machine
work per day. Thousands of machines in 5 data centers.</p>
<p>They started with buildbot. Single master. Hit scaling limits of
single thread single master. Master could not push work to workers
fast enough. Sandcastle has distributed queue. Workers just pull
jobs from distributed queue.</p>
<p>"High-signal feedback is critical." "Flaky failures erode developer
confidence." "We need developers to trust Sandcastle."</p>
<p>Extremely careful separating infra failures from other failures.
Developers don't see infra failures. Infra failures only reported
to Sandcastle team.</p>
<p>Bots look for flaky tests. Stress test individual tests. Run tests
in parallel with themselves. Goal: developers don't see flaky tests.</p>
<p>There is a "not my fault" button that developers can use to report
bad signals.</p>
<p><strong>"Whatever the scale of your engineering organization, developer
efficiency is the key thing that your infrastructure teams should be
striving for. This is why at Facebook we have some of our top
engineers working on developer infrastructure."</strong> (Preach it.)</p>
<p>Excellent talk. <strong>Mozillians doing infra work or who are in charge
of head count for infra work should watch this video.</strong></p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>It's been a <a href="/blog/2015/03/18/network-events/">rough week</a>.</p>
<p>The very short summary of events this week is that both the Firefox
and Firefox OS release automation has been performing a denial of
service attack against
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is nothing new. The release automation
is by far the top consumer of hg.mozilla.org data, requesting several
terabytes per day via several million HTTP requests from thousands of
machines in multiple data centers. The very nature of their existence
makes them a significant denial of service threat.</p>
<p>Lots of things went wrong this week. While a post mortem will shed
light on them, many fall under the umbrella of <em>release automation was
making more requests than it should have and was doing so in a way
that both increased the chances of an outage occurring and increased
the chances of a prolonged outage.</em> This resulted in the hg.mozilla.org
servers working harder than they ever have. As a result, we have some
new <em>high scores</em> to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On UTC day March 19, hg.mozilla.org transferred 7.4 TB of data.
  This is a significant increase from the ~4 TB we expect on a typical
  weekday. (Even more significant when you consider that most load is
  generated during peak hours.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 1300 UTC hour of March 17, the cluster received 1,363,628
  HTTP requests. No HTTP 503 Service Not Available errors were
  encountered in that window! 300,000 to 400,000 requests per hour is
  typical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 0800 UTC hour of March 19, the cluster transferred 776 GB
  of repository data. That comes out to at least 1.725 Gbps on average
  (I didn't calculate TCP and other overhead). Anything greater than 250
  GB per hour is not very common. No HTTP 503 errors were served from
  the origin servers during this hour!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encountered many periods where hg.mozilla.org was operating more than
twice its normal and expected operating capacity and it was able to
handle the load just fine. As a server operator, I'm proud of this.
The servers were provisioned beyond what is normally needed of them and
it took a truly exceptional event (or two) to bring the service down.
This is generally a good way to do hosted services (you rarely want to be
barely provisioned because you fall over at the slighest change and you
don't want to be grossly over-provisioned because you are wasting money
on idle resources).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hg.mozilla.org service did fall over. Multiple times,
in fact. There is room to improve. As proud as I am that the service
operated well beyond its expected limits, I can't help but feel ashamed
that it did eventual cave in under even extreme load and that people are
probably making under-informed general assumptions like <em>Mercurial can't
scale</em>. The simple fact of the matter is that clients cumulatively
generated an exceptional amount of traffic to hg.mozilla.org this week.
All servers have capacity limits. And this week we encountered the limit
for the current configuration of hg.mozilla.org. Cause and effect.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The Firefox source repositories and automation have been closed the past
few days due to a couple of outages.</p>
<p>Yesterday, aggregate CPU usage on many of the machines in the hg.mozilla.org
cluster hit 100%. Previously, whenever hg.mozilla.org was under high load,
we'd run out of network bandwidth before we ran out of CPU on the machines.
In other words, Mercurial was generating data faster than the network could
accept it.</p>
<p>When this happened, the service started issuing HTTP 503 Service Not
Available responses. This is the universal server signal for <em>I'm down, go
away</em>. Unfortunately, not all clients did this.</p>
<p>Parts of Firefox's release automation retried failing requests
immediately, or with insufficient jitter in their backoff interval.
Actively retrying requests against a server that's experiencing load
issues only makes the problem worse. This effectively prolonged the
outage.</p>
<p>Today, we had a similar but different network issue. The load balancer
fronting hg.mozilla.org can only handle so much bandwidth. Today, we hit
that limit. The load balancer started throttling connections. Load on
hg.mozilla.org skyrocketed and request latency increased. From the
perspective of clients, the service grinded to a halt.</p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org was partially sharing a load balancer with
ftp.mozilla.org. That meant if one of the services experienced very high
load, the other service could effectively be <em>locked out</em> of bandwidth.
We saw this happening this morning. ftp.mozilla.org load was high (it
looks like downloads of Firefox Developer Edition are a major
contributor - these don't go through the CDN for reasons unknown to me)
and there wasn't enough bandwidth to go around.</p>
<p>Separately today, hg.mozilla.org again hit 100% CPU. At that time, it
also set a new record for network throughput: ~3 Gbps. It normally
consumes between 200 and 500 Mbps, with periodic spikes to 750 Mbps.
(Yesterday's event saw a spike to around ~2 Gbps.)</p>
<p>Going back through the hg.mozilla.org server logs, an offender is
quite obvious. Before March 9, total outbound transfer for the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/">build/tools</a> repo was around
1 tebibyte per day. Starting on March 9, it increased to 3 tebibytes per
day! This is quite remarkable, as a clone of this repo is only about
20 MiB. This means the repo was getting cloned about 150,000 times per
day! (Note: I think all these numbers may be low by ~20% - stay tuned
for the final analysis.)</p>
<p>2 TiB/day is statistically significant because we transfer less than 10
TiB/day across all of hg.mozilla.org. And, 1 TiB/day is close to 100
Mbps, assuming requests are evenly spread out (which of course they
aren't).</p>
<p>Multiple things went wrong. If only one or two happened, we'd likely be
fine. Maybe there would have been a short blip. But not the major event
we've been firefighting the last ~24 hours.</p>
<p>This post is only a summary of what went wrong. I'm sure there will be a
post-mortem and that it will contain lots of details for those who want
to know more.</p>
