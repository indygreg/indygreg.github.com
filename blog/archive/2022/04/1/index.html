  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>A little over one year ago, I
<a href="/blog/2021/04/14/pure-rust-implementation-of-apple-code-signing/">announced a project to implement Apple code signing in pure Rust</a>.
There have been quite a number of developments since that post and I thought
a blog post was in order. So here we are!</p>
<p>But first, some background on why we're here.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>(Skip this section if you just want to get to the technical bits.)</p>
<p>Apple runs some of the largest and most profitable software application
ecosystems in existence. Gaining access to these ecosystems has traditionally
required the use of macOS and membership in the Apple Developer Program.</p>
<p>For the most part this makes sense: if you want to develop applications for
Apple operating systems you will likely utilize Apple's operating systems
and Apple's official tooling for development and distribution. Sticking to
the paved road is a good default!</p>
<p>But many people want more... flexibility. Open source developers, for example,
often want to distribute cross-platform applications with minimal effort.
There are entire programming language ecosystems where the operating system
you are running on is abstracted away as an implementation detail for many
applications. <strong>By creating a de facto requirement that macOS, iOS, etc
development require the direct access to macOS and (often above market priced)
Apple hardware, the distribution requirements imposed by Apple's software
ecosystems are effectively exclusionary and prevent interested parties
from contributing to the ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>One of the aspects of software distribution on Apple platforms that trips
a lot of people up is code signing and notarization. Essentially, you need
to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embed a cryptographic signature in applications that effectively attests
   to its authenticity from an Apple Developer Program associated account.
   (This is signing.)</li>
<li>Upload your application to Apple so they can inspect it, verify it meets
   requirements, likely store a copy of it. Apple then issues their own
   cryptographic signature called a <em>notarization ticket</em> which then needs
   to be <em>stapled</em>/attached to the application being distributed so Apple
   operating systems can trust it. (This is notarization.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Historically, these steps required Apple proprietary software run exclusively
from macOS. This means that even if you are in a software ecosystem like Rust,
Go, or the web platform where you can cross-compile apps without direct access
to macOS (testing is obviously a different story), you would still need macOS
somewhere if you wanted to sign and notarize your application. And signing and
notarization is effectively required on macOS due to default security settings.
On mobile platforms like iOS, it is impossible to distribute applications that
aren't signed and notarized unless you are running a jailbreaked device.</p>
<p>A lot of people (myself included) have grumbled at these requirements.
Why should I be forced to involve an Apple machine as part of my software
release process if I don't need macOS to build my application? Why do I have
to go through a convoluted dance to sign and notarize my application at
release time - can't it be more streamlined?</p>
<p>When I looked at this space last year, I saw some obvious inefficiencies
and room to improve. So as I said then, I <em>foolishly</em> set out to reimplement
Apple code signing so developers would have more flexibility and opportunity
for distributing applications to Apple's ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>The ultimate goal of this work is to expand Apple ecosystem access to more
developers.</strong> A year later, I believe I'm delivering a product capable of
doing this.</p>
<h2>One Year Later</h2>
<p><strong>Foremost, I'm excited to announce release of
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign/0.14.0">rcodesign 0.14.0</a>.
This is the first time I'm publishing pre-built binaries (Linux, Windows, and macOS)
of <code>rcodesign</code>. This reflects my confidence in the relative maturity of the
software.</strong></p>
<p>In case you are wondering, yes, the macOS <code>rcodesign</code> executable is self-signed:
it was signed by a GitHub Actions Linux runner using a code signing certificate
exclusive to a YubiKey. That YubiKey was plugged into a Windows 11 desktop next to
my desk. The <code>rcodesign</code> executable was not copied between machines as part of the
signing operation. Read on to learn about the sorcery that made this possible.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/tree/main/apple-codesign">apple-codesign</a>
project / Rust crate in the last year! Just look at the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/blob/main/apple-codesign/CHANGELOG.rst">changelog</a>!</p>
<p>The project was renamed from <code>tugger-apple-codesign</code>.</p>
<p>(If you installed via <code>cargo install</code>, you'll need to
<code>cargo install --force apple-codesign</code> to force Cargo to overwrite the <code>rcodesign</code>
executable with one from a different crate.)</p>
<p>The <code>rcodesign</code> CLI executable is still there and more powerful than ever.
You can still sign Apple applications from Linux, Windows, macOS, and any other
platform you can get the Rust program to compile on.</p>
<p>There is now <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign.html">Sphinx documentation for the project</a>.
This is published on readthedocs.io alongside PyOxidizer's documentation (because
I'm using a monorepo). There's some general documentation in there, such as a
guide on how to
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_custom_assessment_policies.html">selectively bypass Gatekeeper</a>
by deploying your own alternative code signing PKI to parallel Apple's. (This
seems like something many companies would want but for whatever reason I'm
not aware of anyone doing this - possibly because very few people understand
how these systems work.)</p>
<p>There are bug fixes galore. When I look back at the state of <code>rcodesign</code>
when I first blogged about it, I think of how naive I was. There were a myriad
of applications that wouldn't pass notarization because of a long tail of bugs.
There are still known issues. But <strong>I believe many applications will
successfully sign and notarize now.</strong> I consider failures novel and worthy of
bug reports - so please <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">report them</a>!</p>
<p>Read on to learn about some of the notable improvements in the past year (many
of them occurring in the last two months).</p>
<h2>Support for Signing Bundles, DMGs, and <code>.pkg</code> Installers</h2>
<p>When I announced this project last year, only Mach-O binaries and trivially
simple <code>.app</code> bundles were signable. And even then there were a ton of subtle
issues.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign sign</code> can now sign more complex bundles, including many nested
bundles. There are reports of iOS app bundles signing correctly! (However, we
don't yet have good end-user documentation for signing iOS apps. I will gladly
accept PRs to improve the documentation!)</p>
<p>The tool also gained support for signing <code>.dmg</code> disk image files and <code>.pkg</code>
flat package installers.</p>
<p>Known limitations with signing are now
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_quirks.html">documented</a>
in the Sphinx docs.</p>
<p><strong>I believe <code>rcodesign</code> now supports signing all the major file formats used
for Apple software distribution.</strong> If you find something that doesn't sign
and it isn't documented as a known issue with an existing GitHub issue tracking
it, please report it!</p>
<h2>Support for Notarization on Linux, Windows, and macOS</h2>
<p>Apple publishes a Java tool named
<a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/">Transporter</a> that enables you
to upload artifacts to Apple for notarization. They make this tool available for
Linux, Windows, and of course macOS.</p>
<p>While this tool isn't open source (as far as I know), usage of this tool enables
you to notarize from Linux and Windows while still using Apple's official
tooling for communicating with their servers.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign</code> now has support for invoking Transporter and uploading artifacts
to Apple for notarization. We now support notarizing bundles, <code>.dmg</code> disk
images, and <code>.pkg</code> flat installer packages. I've successfully notarized all
of these application types from Linux.</p>
<p>(I'm capable of implementing
an alternative uploader in pure Rust but without assurances that Apple won't
bring down the ban hammer for violating terms of use, this is a bridge I'm
not yet willing to cross. The requirement to use Transporter is literally the
only thing standing in the way of making <code>rcodesign</code> an all-in-one single
file executable tool for signing and notarizing Apple software and I <strong>really</strong>
wish I could deliver this user experience win without reprisal.)</p>
<p><strong>With support for both signing and notarizing all application types, it is
now possible to release Apple software without macOS involved in your release
process.</strong></p>
<h2>YubiKey Integration</h2>
<p>I try to use my YubiKeys as much as possible because a secret or private key
stored on a YubiKey is likely more secure than a secret or private key sitting
around on a filesystem somewhere. If you hack my machine, you can likely
gain access to my private keys. But you will need physical access to my
YubiKey and to compel or coerce me into unlocking it in order to gain access
to its private keys.</p>
<p><strong><code>rcodesign</code> now has support for using YubiKeys for signing operations.</strong></p>
<p>This does require an off-by-default <code>smartcard</code> Cargo feature. So if
building manually you'll need to e.g.
<code>cargo install --features smartcard apple-codesign</code>.</p>
<p>The YubiKey integration comes courtesy of the amazing
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/yubikey">yubikey</a> Rust crate. This crate will speak
directly to the smartcard APIs built into macOS and Windows. So if you have an
<code>rcodesign</code> build with YubiKey support enabled, YubiKeys should
<em>just work</em>. Try it by plugging in your YubiKey and running
<code>rcodesign smartcard-scan</code>.</p>
<p>YubiKey integration has its
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_smartcard.html">own documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I even implemented some commands to make it easy to manage the code signing
certificates on your YubiKey. For example, you can run
<code>rcodesign smartcard-generate-key --smartcard-slot 9c</code> to generate a new private
key directly on the device and then
<code>rcodesign generate-certificate-signing-request --smartcard-slot 9c --csr-pem-path csr.pem</code>
to export that certificate to a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which you can
exchange for an Applie-issued signing certificate at developer.apple.com. <strong>This
means you can easily create code signing certificates whose private key was
generated directly on the hardware device and can never be exported.</strong>
Generating keys this way is widely considered to be more secure than storing
keys in software vaults, like Apple's Keychains.</p>
<h2>Remote Code Signing</h2>
<p>The feature I'm most excited about is what I'm calling
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing.html">remote code signing</a>.</p>
<p>Remote code signing allows you to delegate the low-level cryptographic signature
operations in code signing to a separate machine.</p>
<p>It's probably easiest to just demonstrate what it can do.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier today I signed a macOS universal Mach-O executable from a GitHub-hosted
Linux GitHub Actions runner using a YubiKey physically attached to the
Windows 11 machine next to my desk at home. The signed application was not
copied between machines.</strong></p>
<p>Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>I have a GitHub Actions workflow that calls <code>rcodesign sign --remote-signer</code>.
I manually triggered that workflow and started watching the near real time
job output with my browser. Here's a screenshot of the job logs:</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions initiating remote code signing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_sjs_join.png" /></p>
<p><code>rcodesign sign --remote-signer</code> prints out some instructions (including a
wall of base64 encoded data) for what to do next. Importantly, it requests that
someone else run <code>rcodesign remote-sign</code> to continue the signing process.</p>
<p>And here's a screenshot of me doing that from the Windows terminal:</p>
<p><img alt="Windows terminal output from running remote-sign command" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_signer_output.png" /></p>
<p>This log shows us connecting and authenticating with the YubiKey along
with some status updates regarding speaking to a remote server.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a screenshot of the GitHub Actions job output after
I ran that command on my Windows machine:</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions initiating machine output" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/058f718641ad47b39ccf54346f0f0ad6e91bd09b/apple-codesign/docs/apple_codesign_actions_initiator_output.png" /></p>
<p><em>Remote signing</em> enabled me to sign a macOS application from a GitHub Actions
runner operated by GitHub while using a code signing certificate securely
stored on my YubiKey plugged into a Windows machine hundreds of kilometers away
from the GitHub Actions runner. Magic, right?</p>
<p>What's happening here is the 2 <code>rcodesign</code> processes are communicating
with each other via websockets bridged by a central relay server.
(I operate a
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html#default-remote-code-signing-server">default server free of charge</a>.
The server is open source and a Terraform module is available if you want
to run your own server with hopefully just a few minutes of effort.)
When the initiating machine wants to create a signature, it sends a
message back to the <em>signer</em> requesting a cryptographic signature. The
signature is then sent back to the initiator, who incorporates it.</p>
<p><strong>I designed this feature with automated releases from CI systems (like
GitHub Actions) in mind. I wanted a way where I could streamline the
code signing and release process of applications without having to give
a low trust machine in CI ~unlimited access to my private signing key.
But the more I thought about it the more I realized there are likely
many other scenarios where this could be useful. Have you ever emailed
or Dropboxed an application for someone else to sign because you don't
have an Apple issued code signing certificate? Now you have an alternative
solution that doesn't require copying files around!</strong> As long as you
can see the log output from the initiating machine or have that output
communicated to you (say over a chat application or email), you can
remotely sign files on another machine!</p>
<h3>An Aside on the Security of Remote Signing</h3>
<p>At this point, I'm confident the more security conscious among you have
been grimacing for a few paragraphs now. Websockets through a central
server operated by a 3rd party?! Giving remote machines access to perform
code signing against arbitrary content?! Your fears and skepticism are
100% justified: I'd be thinking the same thing!</p>
<p>I fully recognize that a service that facilitates remote code signing makes
for a very lucrative attack target! If abused, it could be used to coerce
parties with valid code signing certificates to sign unwanted code, like
malware. There are many, many, many <em>wrong</em> ways to implement such a feature.
I pondered for hours about the threat modeling and how to make this feature
as secure as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html">Remote Code Signing Design and Security Considerations</a>
captures some of my high level design goals and security assessments.
And <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_protocol.html">Remote Code Signing Protocol</a>
goes into detail about the communications protocol, including the
crypto (actual cryptography, not the fad) involved. The key takeaways are
the protocol and server are designed such that a malicious server or
man-in-the-middle can not forge signature requests. Signing sessions expire
after a few minutes and 3rd parties (or the server) can't inject malicious
messages that would result in unwanted signatures. There is an initial
handshake to derive a session ephemeral shared encryption key and from
there symmetric encryption keys are used so all meaningful messages between
peers are end-to-end encrypted. About the worst a malicious server could do
is conduct a denial of service. This is by design.</p>
<p>As I argue in <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_design.html#security-analysis-in-the-bigger-picture">Security Analysis in the Bigger Picture</a>,
I believe that my implementation of <em>remote signing</em> is <strong>more</strong> secure than
many common practices because common practices today entail making copies
of private keys and giving low trust machines (like CI workers) access to
private keys. Or files are copied around without cryptographic chain-of-custody
to prove against tampering. Yes, <em>remote signing</em> introduces a vector for remote
access to <em>use</em> signing keys. But practiced as I intended, <em>remote signing</em> can
eliminate the need to copy private keys or grant ~unlimited access to them.
From a threat modeling perspective, I think the net restriction in key
access makes <em>remote signing</em> more secure than the private key management
practices by many today.</p>
<p><strong>All that being said, the giant asterisk here is I implemented my own
cryptosystem to achieve end-to-end message security. If there are bugs in
the design or implementation, that cryptosystem could come crashing down,
bringing defenses against message forgery with it.</strong> At that point, a
malicious server or privileged network actor could potentially coerce
someone into signing unwanted software. But this is likely the extent of
the damage: an offline attack against the signing key should not be
possible since signing requires presence and since the private key is
never transmitted over the wire. Even without the end-to-end encryption,
the system is <em>arguably</em> more secure than leaving your private key
lingering around as an easily exfiltrated CI secret (or similar).</p>
<p>(I apologize to every cryptographer I worked with at Mozilla who beat into me
the commandment that <em>thou shall not roll their own crypto</em>: I have sinned
and I feel remorseful.) </p>
<p>Cryptography is hard. And I'm sure I made plenty of subtle mistakes.
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/552">Issue #552</a> tracks
getting an audit of this protocol and code performed. And the aforementioned
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing_protocol.html">protocol design docs</a>
call out some of the places where I question decisions I've made.</p>
<p><strong>If you would be interested in doing a security review on this feature,
please get in touch on issue #552 or
<a href="mailto:gregory.szorc@gmail.com">send me an email</a>. If there's one immediate
outcome I'd like from this blog post it would be for some white hat^Hknight
to show up and give me peace of mind about the cryptosystem implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Until then, please assume the end-to-end encryption is completely flawed.</strong>
Consider asking someone with <em>security</em> or <em>cryptographer</em> in their job title
for their opinion on whether this feature is safe for you to use. Hopefully
we'll get a security review done soon and this caveat can go away!</p>
<p>If you do want to use this feature,
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_remote_signing.html">Remote Code Signing</a>
contains some usage documentation, including how to use it with GitHub
Actions. (I could also use some help productionizing a reusable GitHub Action
to make this more turnkey! Although I'm hesitant to do it before I know the
cryptosystem is sound.)</p>
<p>That was a long introduction to <em>remote code signing</em>. But I couldn't
in good faith present the feature without addressing the security aspect.
Hopefully I didn't scare you away! <strong>Traditional / local signing should
have no security concerns</strong> (beyond the willingness to run software written
by somebody you probably don't know, of course).</p>
<h2>Apple Keychain Support</h2>
<p>As of today's 0.14 release we now have early support for signing with code signing
certificates stored in Apple Keychains! If you created your Apple code signing
certificates in Keychain Access or Xcode, this is probably where you code
signing certificates live.</p>
<p>I held off implementing this for the longest time because I didn't perceive
there to be a benefit: if you are on macOS, just use Apple's official tooling.
But with <code>rcodesign</code> gaining support for remote code signing and some other
features that could make it a compelling replacement for Apple tooling on
all platforms, I figured we should provide the feature so we stop discouraging
people to export private keys from Keychains.</p>
<p>This integration is very young and there's still a lot that can be done,
such as automatically using an appropriate signing certificate based on
what you are signing. Please file feature request issues if there's
a must-have feature you are missing!</p>
<h2>Better Debugging of Failures</h2>
<p>Apple's code signing is complex. It is easy for there to be subtle differences
between Apple's tooling and <code>rcodesign</code>.</p>
<p><code>rcodesign</code> now has <code>print-signature-info</code> and <code>diff-signatures</code> commands to
dump and compare YAML metadata pertinent to code signing to make it easier to
compare behavior between code signing implementations and even multiple
signing operations.</p>
<p>The documentation around
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">debugging and reporting bugs</a>
now emphasizes using these tools to help identify bugs.</p>
<h2>A Request For Users and Feedback</h2>
<p>I now believe <code>rcodesign</code> to be generally usable. I've thrown a lot of
random software at it and I feel like most of the big bugs and major missing
features are behind us.</p>
<p>But I also feel it hasn't yet received wide enough attention to have confidence
in that assessment.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to help the development of this tool, the most important
actions you can take are to attempt signing / notarization operations with it
and report your results.</strong></p>
<p>Does <code>rcodesign</code> spark joy? Please leave a comment in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/discussions/556">GitHub discussion for the latest release</a>!</p>
<p>Does <code>rcodesign</code> not work? I would very much appreciate a bug report!
Details on how to file good bugs are
<a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_debugging.html">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>Have general feedback? UI is confusing? Documentation is insufficient?
Leave a comment in the aforementioned discussion. Or
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/new">create a GitHub issue</a> if
you think it is actionable. I can't fix what I don't know about!</p>
<p>Have private feedback? <a href="mailto:gregory.szorc@gmail.com">Send me an email</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I could write thousands of words about all I learned from hacking on this
project.</p>
<p>I've learned way too much about too many standards and specifications in the
crypto space. RFCs 2986, 3161, 3280, 3281, 3447, 4210, 4519, 5280, 5480,
5652, 5869, 5915, 5958, and 8017 plus probably a few more. How cryptographic
primitives are stored and expressed: ASN.1, OIDs, BER, DER, PEM, SPKI,
PKCS#1, PKCS#8. You can show me the raw parse tree for an ASN.1 data structure
and I can probably tell you what RFC defines it. I'm not proud of this. But
I will say actually knowing what every field in an X.509 certificate does
or the many formats that cryptographic keys are expressed in seems empowering.
Before, I would just search for the <code>openssl</code> incantation to do something.
Now, I know which ASN.1 data structures are involved and how to manipulate
the fields within.</p>
<p>I've learned way too much around minutia around how Apple code signing
actually works. The mechanism is way too complex for something in the security
space. There was at least one high profile Gatekeeper bug in the past year
allowing improperly signed code to run. I suspect there will be more: the
surface area to exploit is just too large.</p>
<p><strong>I think I'm proud of building an open source implementation of Apple's code
signing. To my knowledge nobody else has done this outside of Apple. At least
not to the degree I have.</strong> Then factor in that I was able to do this without
access (or willingness) to look at Apple source code and much of the progress was
achieved by diffing and comparing results with Apple's tooling. Hours of
staring at diffoscope and comparing binary data structures. Hours of trying
to find the magical settings that enabled a SHA-1 or SHA-256 digest to agree.
It was tedious work for sure. I'll likely never see a financial return on
the time equivalent it took me to develop this software. But, I suppose I
can nerd brag that I was able to implement this!</p>
<p><strong>But the real reward for this work will be if it opens up avenues to more
(open source) projects distributing to the Apple ecosystems.</strong> This has
historically been challenging for multiple reasons and many open source
projects have avoided official / proper distribution channels to avoid the
pain (or in some cases because of philosophical disagreements with the premise
of having a walled software garden in the first place). I suspect things
will only get worse, as I feel it is inevitable Apple clamps down on signing
and notarization requirements on macOS due to the rising costs of malware
and ransomware. <strong>So having an alternative, open source, and multi-platform
implementation of Apple code signing seems like something important that
should exist in order to provide opportunities to otherwise excluded
developers. I would be humbled if my work empowers others. And this is
all the reward I need.</strong></p>
