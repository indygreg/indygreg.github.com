  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I have just released
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zstandard/0.9.0">python-zstandard 0.9.0</a>. You can
install the latest release by running <code>pip install zstandard==0.9.0</code>.</p>
<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstandard</a> is a highly tunable and therefore
flexible compression algorithm with support for modern features such as
multi-threaded compression and <em>dictionaries</em>. Its performance is remarkable
and if you use it as a drop-in replacement for zlib, bzip2, or other common
algorithms, you'll frequently see more than a doubling in performance.</p>
<p>python-zstandard provides rich bindings to the zstandard C library without
sacrificing performance, safety, features, or a Pythonic feel. The bindings
run on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 using either a C extension or CFFI
bindings, so it works with CPython and PyPy.</p>
<p>I can make a compelling argument that python-zstandard is one of the
richest compression packages available to Python programmers. Using it, you
will be able to leverage compression in ways you couldn't with other packages
(especially those in the standard library) all while achieving ridiculous
performance. Due to my focus on performance, python-zstandard is able to
outperform Python bindings to other compression libraries that <em>should</em> be
faster. This is because python-zstandard is very diligent about minimizing
memory allocations and copying, minimizing Python object creation, reusing
state, etc.</p>
<p>While python-zstandard is formally marked as a beta-level project and hasn't
yet reached a 1.0 release, it is suitable for production usage.
python-zstandard 0.8 shipped with Mercurial and is in active production
use there. I'm also aware of other consumers using it in production, including
at Facebook and Mozilla.</p>
<p>The sections below document some of the new features of python-zstandard 0.9.</p>
<h2>File Object Interface for Reading</h2>
<p>The 0.9 release contains a <code>stream_reader()</code> API on the compressor and
decompressor objects that allows you to treat those objects as readable file
objects. This means that you can pass a <code>ZstdCompressor</code> or <code>ZstdDecompressor</code>
around to things that accept file objects and things generally <em>just work</em>.
e.g.:</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>   <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">compressed_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rb&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">ifh</span><span class="p">:</span>
       <span class="n">cctx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">zstd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ZstdDecompressor</span><span class="p">()</span>
       <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">cctx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stream_reader</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ifh</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>
           <span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
               <span class="n">chunk</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32768</span><span class="p">)</span>
               <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">chunk</span><span class="p">:</span>
                   <span class="k">break</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is probably the most requested python-zstandard feature.</p>
<p>While the feature is usable, it isn't complete. Support for <code>readline()</code>,
<code>readinto()</code>, and a few other APIs is not yet implemented. In addition,
you can't use these <em>reader</em> objects for opening zstandard compressed
tarball files because Python's <code>tarfile</code> package insists on doing
backward seeks when reading. The current implementation doesn't support
backwards seeking because that requires buffering decompressed output and that
is not trivial to implement. I recognize that all these features are useful
and I will try to work them into a subsequent release of 0.9.</p>
<h2>Negative Compression Levels</h2>
<p>The 1.3.4 release of zstandard (which python-zstandard 0.9 bundles) supports
negative compression levels. I won't go into details, but negative compression
levels disable extra compression features and allow you to trade compression
ratio for more speed.</p>
<p>When compressing a 6,472,921,921 byte uncompressed bundle of the Firefox
Mercurial repository, the previous fastest we could go with level 1 was
~510 MB/s (measured on the input side) yielding a 1,675,227,803 file (25.88%
of original).</p>
<p>With level <code>-1</code>, we compress to 1,934,253,955 (29.88% of original) at
~590 MB/s. With level <code>-5</code>, we compress to 2,339,110,873 bytes (36.14% of
original) at ~720 MB/s.</p>
<p>On the decompress side, level 1 decompresses at ~1,150 MB/s (measured at
the output side), -1 at ~1,320 MB/s, and -5 at ~1,350 MB/s (generally speaking,
zstandard's decompression speeds are relatively similar - and fast - across
compression levels).</p>
<p>And that's just with a single thread. zstandard supports using multiple
threads to compress a single input and python-zstandard makes this feature
easy to use. Using 8 threads on my 4+4 core i7-6700K, level 1 compresses
at ~2,000 MB/s (3.9x speedup), -1 at ~2,300 MB/s (3.9x speedup), and -5
at ~2,700 MB/s (3.75x speedup).</p>
<p>That's with a large input. What about small inputs?</p>
<p>If we take 456,599 Mercurial commit objects spanning 298,609,254 bytes from
the Firefox repository and compress them individually, at level 1 we yield
a total of 133,457,198 bytes (44.7% of original) at ~112 MB/s. At level -1,
we compress to 161,241,797 bytes (54.0% of original) at ~215 MB/s. And at
level -5, we compress to 185,885,545 bytes (62.3% of original) at ~395 MB/s.</p>
<p>On the decompression side, level 1 decompresses at ~260 MB/s, -1 at
~1,000 MB/s, and -5 at ~1,150 MB/s.</p>
<p>Again, that's 456,599 operations on a single thread with Python.</p>
<p>python-zstandard has an <em>experimental</em> API where you can pass in a collection
of inputs and it batch compresses or decompresses them in a single operation.
It releases and GIL and uses multiple threads. It puts the results in shared
buffers in order to minimize the overhead of memory allocations and Python
object creation and garbage collection. Using this mode with 8 threads on
my 4+4 core i7-6700K, level 1 compresses at ~525 MB/s, -1 at ~1,070 MB/s,
and -5 at ~1,930 MB/s. On the decompression side, level 1 is ~1,320 MB/s,
-1 at ~3,800 MB/s, and -5 at ~4,430 MB/s.</p>
<p>So, my consumer grade desktop i7-6700K is capable of emitting decompressed
data at over 4 GB/s with Python. That's pretty good if you ask me. (Full
disclosure: the timings were taken just around the compression operation
itself: overhead of loading data into memory was not taken into account. See
the <code>bench.py</code> script in the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">source repository</a> for more.</p>
<h2>Long Distance Matching Mode</h2>
<p>Negative compression levels take zstandard into performance territory that
has historically been reserved for compression formats like lz4 that are
optimized for that domain. <em>Long distance matching</em> takes zstandard in the
other direction, towards compression formats that aim to achieve optimal
compression ratios at the expense of time and memory usage.</p>
<p>python-zstandard 0.9 supports long distance matching and all the configurable
parameters exposed by the zstandard API.</p>
<p>I'm not going to capture many performance numbers here because python-zstandard
performs about the same as the C implementation because <em>LDM</em> mode spends
most of its time in zstandard C code. If you are interested in numbers, I
recommend reading the zstandard
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.2">1.3.2</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.4">1.3.4</a> release notes.</p>
<p>I will, however, underscore that zstandard can achieve close to lzma's
compression ratios (what the <code>xz</code> utility uses) while completely smoking
lzma on decompression speed. For a bundle of the Firefox Mercurial repository,
zstandard level 19 with a long distance window size of 512 MB using 8 threads
compresses to 1,033,633,309 bytes (16.0%) in ~260s wall, 1,730s CPU.
<code>xz -T8 -8</code> compresses to 1,009,233,160 (15.6%) in ~367s wall, ~2,790s CPU.</p>
<p>On the decompression side, zstandard takes ~4.8s and runs at ~1,350 MB/s as
measured on the output side while <code>xz</code> takes ~54s and runs at ~114 MB/s.
Zstandard, however, does use a lot more memory than <code>xz</code> for decompression,
so that performance comes with a cost (512 MB versus 32 MB for this
configuration).</p>
<h2>Other Notable Changes</h2>
<p>python-zstandard now uses the <em>advanced</em> compression and decompression APIs
everywhere. All tunable compression and decompression parameters are available
to python-zstandard. This includes support for disabling magic headers in frames
(saves 4 bytes per frame - this can matter for very small inputs, especially when
using dictionary compression).</p>
<p>The full dictionary training API is exposed. Dictionary training can now use
multiple threads.</p>
<p>There are a handful of utility functions for inspecting zstandard frames,
querying the state of compressors, etc.</p>
<p>Lots of work has gone into shoring up the code base. We now build with warnings
as errors in CI. I performed a number of focused auditing passes to fix
various classes of deficiencies in the C code. This includes use of the
<em>buffer protocol</em>: python-zstandard is now able to accept <em>any</em> Python
object that provides a view into its underlying raw data.</p>
<p>Decompression contexts can now be constructed with a max memory threshold
so attempts to decompress something that would require more memory will
result in error.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since I last released a major version of python-zstandard, a lot has changed in
the zstandard world. As I
<a href="/blog/2017/03/07/better-compression-with-zstandard/">blogged last year</a>,
zstandard circa early 2017 was a very compelling compression format: it already
outperformed popular compression formats like zlib and bzip2 across the board.
As a <em>general purpose</em> compression format, it made a compelling case for itself.
In my mind, <em>brotli</em> was its only real challenger.</p>
<p>As I wrote then, zstandard isn't perfect. (Nothing is.) But a year later, it
is refreshing to see advancements.</p>
<p>A criticism one year ago was zstandard was pretty good as a general purpose
compression format but it wasn't great if you live at the fringes. If you were
a speed freak, you'd probably use lz4. If you cared about compression ratios,
you'd probably use lzma. But recent releases of zstandard have made huge strides
into the territory of these niche formats. Negative compression levels allow
zstandard to flirt with lz4's performance. Long distance matching allows
zstandard to achieve close to lzma's compression ratios. <strong>This is a big friggin
deal because it makes it much, much harder to justify a domain-specific compression
format over zstandard.</strong> I think lzma still has a significant edge for ultra
compression ratios when memory utilization is a concern. But for many consumers,
memory is readily available and it is easy to justify trading potentially hundreds
of megabytes of memory to achieve a 10x speedup for decompression. Even if you
aren't willing to sacrifice more memory, the ability to tweak compression
parameters is huge. You can do things like store multiple versions of a
compressed document and conditionally serve the one most appropriate for the
client, all while running the same zstandard-only code on the client. That's
huge.</p>
<p>A year later, zstandard continues to impress me for its set of features and its
versatility. The library is continuing to evolve - all while maintaining
backwards compatibility on the decoding side. (That's a sign of a good
format design if you ask me.) I was honestly shocked to see that zstandard
was able to change its compression settings in a way that allowed it to compete
with lz4 and lzma without requiring a format change.</p>
<p>The more I use zstandard, the more I think that <em>everyone should use this</em> and
that popular compression formats just aren't cut out for modern computing any
more. Every time I download a zlib/gz or bzip2 compressed archive, I'm thinking
<em>if only they used zstandard this archive would be smaller, it would have
decompressed already, and I wouldn't be thinking about how annoying it is
to wait for compression operations to complete</em>. In my mind, zstandard is such
an obvious advancement over the status quo and is such a versatile format -
now covering the gamut of super fast compression to ultra ratios - that it is
bordering on negligent to not use zstandard. With the removal of the controversial
patent rights grant license clause in zstandard 1.3.1, that justifiable
resistance to widespread adoption of zstandard has been eliminated. Zstandard
is objectively superior for many workloads and I heavily encourage its use. I
believe python-zstandard provides a high-quality interface to zstandard and
I encourage you to give it and zstandard a try the next time you compress data.</p>
<p>If you run into any problems or want to get involved with development,
python-zstandard lives at
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard">indygreg/python-zstandard</a> on
GitHub.</p>
<p>*(I updated the post on 2018-05-16 to remove a paragraph about zstandard
competition. In the original post, I unfairly compared zstandard to Snappy
instead of Brotli and made some inaccurate statements around that comparison.)</p>
