  <p>The other day I looked at a full Firefox build log from TBPL and noticed
that ~84,000 of the ~170,000 lines in the log I looked at was output
from archive processes. We were printing thousands of lines showing the
files that were being added and extracted from the archives that contain
test files!</p>
<p>I thought this was wasteful, so I filed
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757397">bug 757397</a> and
coded up a patch. Ted agreed that these lines were rather worthless and
the patch has landed in mozilla-inbound.</p>
<p>The result of the patch is build logs are about half as big in terms of
lines. And, it appears at least 500kb is shaved off the compressed log
files as well.</p>
<p>The real world impact is you should be able to load build logs from
the server faster because they are smaller.</p>
<p>If you were parsing this data before and are impacted by this, please
leave a comment on the aforementioned bug and we'll go from there.</p>

</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> 3.1 is scheduled to be released any hour
now. And, I'm proud to say that I've contributed to it! Specifically,
I've contributed improvements to the Python bindings, which are an
interface to
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html">libclang</a>, the C
interface to Clang.</p>
<p>Since 3.1 is being released today, I wanted to share some of the new
features in this release. An exhaustive list of newly supported APIs is
available in the
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#pythonchanges">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Diagnostic Metadata</h2>
<p><em>Diagnostics</em> are how Clang represents warnings and errors during
compilation. The Python bindings
now allow you to get at more metadata. Of particilar interest is
<strong>Diagnostic.option</strong>. This property allows you to see the compiler flag
that triggered the diagnostic. Or, you could query
<strong>Diagnostic.disable_option</strong> for the compiler flag that would silence
this diagnostic.</p>
<p>These might be useful if you are analyzing diagnostics produced by the
compiler. For example, you could parse source code using the Python
bindings and collect aggregate information on all the diagnostics
encountered.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import Index

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('hello.c')

for diag in tu.diagnostics:
    print diag.severity
    print diag.location
    print diag.spelling
    print diag.option
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you are using the Python bindings from trunk:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import TranslationUnit

tu = TranslationUnit.from_source('hello.c')
...
</code></pre>
<p>Sadly, the patch that enabled this simpler usage did not make the 3.1
branch.</p>
<h2>Finding Entities from Source Location</h2>
<p>Two new APIs, <strong>SourceLocation.from_position</strong> and
<strong>Cursor.from_location</strong>, allow you to easily extract a cursor in the AST
from any arbitrary point in a file.</p>
<p>Say you want to find the element in the AST that occupies column 6 of
line #10 in the file <em>foo.c</em>:</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import Cursor
from clang.cindex import Index
from clang.cindex import SourceLocation

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('foo.c')

f = File.from_name(tu, 'foo.c')

location = SourceLocation.from_position(tu, f, 10, 6)
cursor = Cursor.from_location(tu, location)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you could do this by iterating over cursors in the AST until
one with the desired source range is found. But, that would involve more
API calls.</p>
<p>I would like to say that these APIs feel klunky to me. There is lots of
redundancy in there. In my opinion, there should just be a
<strong>TranslationUnit.get_cursor(file='foo.c', line=10, column=6)</strong> that
does the right thing. Maybe that will make it into a future release.
Maybe it won't. After all, the Python bindings are really a thin wrapper
around the C API and an argument can be made that there should be
minimal extra logic and complexity in the Python bindings. Time will
tell.</p>
<h2>Type Metadata</h2>
<p>It is now possible to access more metadata on <strong>Type</strong> instances. For
example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>See what the elements of an array are using <strong>Type.get_array_element_type</strong></li>
<li>See how many elements are in a static array using
  <strong>Type.get_array_element_count</strong></li>
<li>Determine if a function is variadic using <strong>Type.is_function_variadic</strong></li>
<li>Inspect the Types of function arguments using <strong>Type.argument_types</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, I will show how to iterate over all the functions
declared in a file and to inspect their arguments.</p>
<pre><code>from clang.cindex import CursorKind
from clang.cindex import Index
from clang.cindex import TypeKind

index = Index.create()
tu = index.parse('hello.c')

for cursor in tu.cursor.get_children():
    # Ignore AST elements not from the main source file (e.g.
    # from included files).
    if not cursor.location.file or cursor.location.file.name != 'hello.c':
        continue

    # Ignore AST elements not a function declaration.
    if cursor.kind != CursorKind.FUNCTION_DECL:
        continue

    # Obtain the return Type for this function.
    result_type = cursor.type.get_result()

    print 'Function: %s' % cursor.spelling
    print '  Return type: %s' % result_type.kind.spelling
    print '  Arguments:'

    # Function has no arguments.
    if cursor.type.kind == TypeKind.FUNCTIONNOPROTO:
        print '    None'
        continue

    for arg_type in cursor.argument_types():
        print '    %s' % arg_type.kind.spelling
</code></pre>
<p>This example is overly simplified. A more robust solution would also
inspect the Type instances to see if they are constants, check for
pointers, check for variadic functions, etc.</p>
<p>An example application of these APIs is to build a tool which
automatically generated
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> or similar
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>
bindings. Many of these tools today use custom parsers. Why invent a
custom (and likely complex) parser when you can call out into Clang and
have it to all the heavy lifting for you?</p>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<p>As I write this, there are already a handful of Python binding features
checked into Clang's SVN trunk that were made after the 3.1 branch was cut.
And, I'm actively working at integrating many more.</p>
<p>Still to come to the Python bindings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better memory management support (currently, not all references are
  kept everywhere, so it is possible for a GC to collect and dispose of
  objects that should be alive, even though they are not in scope).</li>
<li>Support for token API (lexer output)</li>
<li>More complete coverage of Cursor and Type APIs</li>
<li>More friendly APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a personal goal for the Python bindings to cover 100% of the
functionality in libclang. My work towards that goal is captured in my
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/clang/tree/python_features/">python features</a>
branch on GitHub. I periodically clean up a patch, submit it for review,
apply feedback, and commit. That branch is highly volatile and I do
rebase. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to add additional functionality to libclang
[and expose it to Python]. For example, I would love for libclang to
support code generation (i.e. compiling), not just parsing. This would
enable all kinds of nifty scenarios (like channeling your build system's
compiler calls through a proxy which siphons off metadata such as
diagnostics).</p>
<h2>Credits and Getting Involved</h2>
<p>I'm not alone in my effort to improve Clang's Python bindings.
Anders Waldenborg has landed a number of patches to add functionality
and tests. He has also been actively reviewing patches and implementing
official LLVM Python bindings! On the reviewing front, Manuel Klimek has been
invaluable. I've lost track of how many bugs he's caught and good
suggestions he's made. Tobias Grosser and Chandler Carruth have also
reviewed their fair share of patches and handled community contributions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the Python bindings, we could
use your help! You can find me in <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/#irc">#llvm</a> as
IndyGreg. If I'm not around, the LLVM community is generally pretty helpful,
so I'm sure you'll get an answer. If you prefer email, send it to the
<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev">cfe-dev</a> list.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, leave them in the comments or ask using one
of the methods above.</p>

  <p>Just <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&amp;rev=b063ba6dd084">landed</a>
in mozilla-inbound (Firefox's integration tree) is
support for test-only JavaScript modules. That is, JavaScript modules
that are utilized by just test code. This is being tracked in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748490">bug 748490</a>.</p>
<p>The use case for this feature is sharing common test code, mock types,
etc between tests. For example, in the Services code, we have a number
of mock types (like a JS implementation of the Sync HTTP server) that
need to be utilized across sub-modules. With test-only modules, it is
now possible to publish these modules to a common location and import
them using the familiar Cu.import() syntax. Previously, you had to
perform the equivalent of a <em>#include</em> (possibly by utilizing the
<em>[head]</em> section of xpcshell.ini files). The previous method of
importing is dirty because you pollute the global object. Furthermore,
it is really inconvenient when you wish to utilize shared files from
different directories. See
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/f80568dba010/services/sync/tests/unit/xpcshell.ini#l2">this file</a>
for an example.</p>
<p>The new method of publishing and consuming test-only JavaScript modules
is clean and simple. From your Makefile, define <strong>TESTING_JS_MODULES</strong> to
a list of (JavaScript) files to publish. Optionally, define
<strong>TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR</strong> to the relative path they should be published
to. If the directory variable is not defined, they will be published to
the root directory. Here is an example Makefile.in:</p>
<pre><code>DEPTH     = ../..
topsrcdir = @top_srcdir@
srcdir    = @srcdir@

include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

TESTING_JS_MODULES = mockserver.js common.js
TESTING_JS_MODULE_DIR = foobar
</code></pre>
<p>All test modules are installed to a common directory somewhere in the
object directory. Where is not relevant. Just know it is outside the
normal distribution directory, so the test modules aren't packaged. This
common directory is registered with the resource manager under
<em>resource://testing/</em>. So, once a build is performed, you can import these
files via Components.utils.import():</p>
<pre><code>Cu.import("resource://testing-common/foobar/mockserver.js");
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this feature facilitates better reuse of test code. So, next time
you are writing test code, please consider writing writing and publishing it
as a module so others can utilize it.</p>
<p>One more thing. Currently, integration with the resource manager is only
implemented for xpcshell tests. I'd like to see this supported in all
the test runners eventually. I implemented xpcshell support because a)
that is the test harness I use almost exclusively and b) it is the only
one I'm comfortable modifying. If you want to implement support in
another test runner, please have a go at it!</p>

  <p><em>tl;dr User experience matters and developers are people too. I
have proposed a tool to help developers interact with the Firefox build
system and source tree.</em></p>
<p>I don't think I have to make my case when I state that Mozilla's build
system end-user experience is lacking. There are lots of hurdles to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine where to obtain the source code.</li>
<li>Install a source control system (possibly).</li>
<li>Wait a <em>long</em> time for the large source repository to download.</li>
<li>Figure out how to launch the build process (unlike many other build
  systems, it isn't as simple as <code>configure</code> or <code>make</code> - although it is
  close).</li>
<li>Determine which dependencies need to be installed and install them
  (this can also take a long time).</li>
<li>Create a configuration file (mozconfig).</li>
<li>Build the tree (another long process).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to contribute patches, there are additional steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure Mercurial with your personal info.</li>
<li>Configure Mercurial to generate patches in proper format.</li>
<li>Create a Bugzilla account (made simpler through Persona!).</li>
<li>Figure out the proper Bugzilla product/component (even I still
  struggle at this) so you can file a bug.</li>
<li>Figure out how to attach a patch to a bug and request review (it isn't
  intuitive if you've never used Bugzilla before).</li>
<li>Figure out who should review patch.</li>
<li>Learn how tests work so you can:</li>
<li>Write new tests.</li>
<li>Run existing tests to verify your changes.</li>
<li>Obtain commit access (so at least you can push to Try).</li>
<li>Learn how to push to Try.</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://tbpl.mozilla.org/">TBPL</a>.</li>
<li>Discover and use some of the amazing tools to help you
  (<a href="https://mxr.mozilla.org/">MXR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>,
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sfink/mqext">mqext</a>, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted, not all of these are required. But, they will be for returning
contributors. My point is that there are lots of steps here. And, every
one of them represents a point where someone could get frustrated and
bail -- a point where Mozilla loses a potential contributor.</p>
<p>Ever since I started at Mozilla, I've been thinking of ways this could
be done better. While the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide">Developer Guide</a>
on MDN has improved drastically in the last year, there are still many
ways the process could be improved and streamlined.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a>,
I've put forward the groundwork of a tool to make the developer
experience more user friendly. Yes, this is a vague goal, so let me go
in to further detail.</p>
<p>What I've submitted in the bug is essentially a framework for
performing common actions related to the build system and source tree.
These actions are defined as methods in Python code. Hooking it all
together is a command-line interface which is launched via a short
script in the root directory called <em>mach</em> (<em>mach</em> is German for <em>do</em>).
Since actions speak louder than words, here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach

usage: mach command [command arguments]

This program is your main control point for the Mozilla source tree.

To perform an action, specify it as the first argument. Here are some common
actions:

  mach build         Build the source tree.
  mach help          Show full help.
  mach xpcshell-test Run xpcshell test(s).

To see more help for a specific action, run:

  mach &lt;command&gt; --help

e.g. mach build --help
</code></pre>
<p>And, going into a sub-command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach xpcshell-test --help

usage: mach xpcshell-test [-h] [--debug] [TEST]

positional arguments:
  TEST         Test to run. Can be specified as a single JS file, an
               xpcshell.ini manifest file, a directory, or omitted. If
               omitted, the entire xpcshell suite is executed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --debug, -d  Run test in debugger.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I've focused effort at this stage on performing actions after the
initial build environment is configured. The reason is this is
low-hanging fruit and easily allows me to create a proof-of-concept.
But, I have many more ideas that I'd eventually like to see implemented.</p>
<p>One of my grand ideas is to have some kind of setup wizard guide
you through the first time you use <em>mach</em>. It can start by asking the
basics: "Which application do you want to build?" "Release or Debug?"
"Clang or GCC?" "Should I install Clang for you?" It could also be more
intelligent about installing dependencies. "I see you are using Ubuntu
and are missing required packages X and Y. Would you like me to install
them?" And, why stop at a command-line interface? There's no reason a
graphical frontend (perhaps Tcl/Tk) couldn't be implemented!</p>
<p>The setup wizard could even encompass configuring your source control
system for proper patch generation by ensuring your tree-local <em>.hg/hgrc</em>
or <em>.git/config</em> files have the proper settings. We could even ask you
for Bugzilla credentials so you could interact with Bugzilla directly
from the command-line.</p>
<p>Once we have all of the basic configs in place, it's just a matter of
hooking up the plumbing. Want to submit a patch for review? We could
provide a command for that:</p>
<pre><code>./mach submit-patch

"refactor-foo" is currently on top of your patch queue.

Submit "refactor-foo"?
y/n: y

Enter bug number for patch or leave empty for no existing bug.
Bug number:

OK. A new bug for this patch will be created.

Please enter a one-line summary of the patch:
Summary: Refactor foo subsystem

Is the patch for (r)eview, (f)eedback, or (n)either?
r/f/n: r

I've identified Gregory Szorc (:gps) as a potential reviewer for
this code. If you'd like someone else, please enter their IRC
nickname or e-mail address. Otherwise, press ENTER.
Reviewer:

I'm ready to submit your patch. Press ENTER to continue or CTRL+C to
abort.

Bug 700000 submitted! You can track it at
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=700000
</code></pre>
<p>The framework is extremely flexible and extensible for a few reasons.
First, it encourages all of the core <em>actions</em> to be implemented as
Python modules/methods. Once you have things defined as API calls (not
shell scripts), the environment feels like a cohesive library rather than
a loose collection of shell scripts. Shell scripts have a place, don't get
me wrong. But, they are hard to debug and test (not to mention performance
penalties on Windows). Writing code as reusable libraries with shell
scripts only being the frontend is a more robust approach to software
design.</p>
<p>Second, the command-line driver is implemented as a collection of
sub-commands. This is similar to how version control systems like Git,
Mercurial, and Subversion work. This makes discovery of features
extremely easy: just list the supported commands! Contrast this to our
current build system, where the answer is to consult a wiki (with likely
out-of-date and fragmented information) or <em>gasp</em> try to read the
makefiles in the tree.</p>
<p>My immediate goal for
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=751795">bug 751795</a> is to
get a minimal framework checked in to the tree with a core design people
are content with. Once that is done, <strong>I'm hoping other people will come
along and implement additional features and commands.</strong> Specifically, I'd
like to see some of the awesome tools like <em>mqext</em> integrated such that
their power can be harnessed without requiring people to first discover
they exist and second install and configure them. I think it is silly for
these obvious productivity wins to go unused by people ignrant of their
existence. If they are valuable, let's ship them as part of a batteries
included environment.</p>
<p>In the long run, I think there are many more uses for this framework.
For starters, it gives us a rallying point around which to organize all
of the Python support/tools code in the tree. Currently, we have things
spread all over the place. Quite frankly, it is a mess. I'd like to have
a unified <em>site-packages</em> tree with all our Python so things are easier to
locate and thus improve.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the tool provides a framework for logging and
formatting activities in a unified way. There are separate log streams:
one for humans, one for machines. Under the hood, they both use the
saming logging infrastructure. When messages are logged, the human
stream is formatted as simple sentences (complete with terminal
encodings and colorization). The machine-destined log stream is
newline-delimited JSON containing the fields that were logged. This
allows analysis of output without having to parse strings. This is how
all log analysis should be done. But, that's for another post. Anyway,
what this all means is that the output for humans can be more readable.
Colors, progress bars: we can do that now.</p>
<p>Over time, I imagine some may want to move logic out of configure and
makefiles and into this tool (because Python is easier to maintain and
debug, IMO). I would love to see that too. But, I want to stress that this
isn't a focus right now. I believe this framework should be supplemental
in the beginning and the official build system should not rely on it. Maybe
that changes in the future. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Anyway, this project is currently just my solo effort. This isn't
captured on a roadmap or anyone's quarterly goals. There is no project page
listing planned features. If you are interested in helping, drop me a line
and/or join in on the bug. Hopefully the core framework will land soon.
Once it does, I'm hoping for an explosion of new, user-friendly
features/commands to make the overall Firefox development experience
smoother.</p>
