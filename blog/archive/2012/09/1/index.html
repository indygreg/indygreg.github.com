  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Hacking on Firefox is <em>hard</em>. Compiling the source tree for the first
time is a daunting experience. If you manage to do that, you still need
to figure out how to submit patches, write and run tests, etc. There is
no shortage of points where people can get confused, make mistakes, or
just give up because the barrier is too high.</p>
<p>I have strong convictions about making the overall developer experience
better (developers are users too, after all). The easier you make the
developer experience, the greater the chances of retaining developers.
And retaining developers means more contributions: more features and
fewer bugs. This translates to a better state for the Mozilla Project.
This makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Since practically my first day working at Mozilla, I've been
experimenting with ways to make contributing to Firefox easier by
improving the build system or interaction with it.</p>
<p>With a lot of help, I've finally succeeded in landing something into the
Firefox source tree that I think will ultimately lead to a much better
developer experience.</p>
<p>It's called <strong>mach</strong> (German for <em>do</em>) and if you pull the latest
version of <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a>
(Firefox's main source code repository), you can run mach today.</p>
<h2>Running Mach</h2>
<p>You can run Mach by simply executing it from the root directory in the
repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./mach
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, I shouldn't have to tell you anything else: mach's output
should provide you all the instruction you need to use it. If it
doesn't, that is a bug and it should be fixed.</p>
<p>Realistically, mach is still in early development and its user
experience still leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Because technical usage docs belong in a medium that is easily
discoverable and where the community can improve on them (not a
post on a personal blog), you can find additional usage information in
the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/mach">mach article</a> on
MDN. The
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mach/README.rst">mach README</a>
holds more technical information for people wanting to poke at the inner
workings.</p>
<p>Mach does require Python 2.7. The build system will likely soon require
Python 2.7 as well. So, if you don't have Python 2.7, you should upgrade
now before you lose the ability to build the tree. Conveniently, the
tree now has a
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/09/18/bootstrap-your-system-to-build-firefox">bootstrap script</a>
which covers the installation of Python. So, Python 2.7 should just be a
simple command away.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Why would you use mach? Good question! Compared to the existing
out-of-the-box experience, mach adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run xpcshell and mochitest tests from the source directory.
  This means you can tab-complete test filenames in your shell and it
  <em>just works</em>.</li>
<li>Parsing of compiler warnings (currently supports Clang 3.1 and MSVC
  formats) into a unified warnings database (actually a JSON file).
  After builds you can run <em>./mach warnings-list</em> or <em>./mach
  warnings-summary</em> to get a concise list without having to look at
  build logs.</li>
<li>A single command-line interface where you can easily discover new
  functionality. Just run <em>./mach help</em> (try doing that with make!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Naysayers will say this is a paltry list. They are correct. I have
bigger plans. But, you have to start somewhere.</p>
<h2>Goals and Future Ideas</h2>
<p>The overall goal of mach is to improve the developer experience of
developing Firefox and other Gecko applications. It does this by
providing a convenient, central command in the root directory of
the repository that acts as both an oracle to discover new commands
and functionality (<em>./mach help</em>) as well as a proxy to execute them.
You don't need to worry about environment variables, working directories,
or finding some random script hidden in the bowells of the source tree.
You just run a single command and the world is brought to you. No build
documentation. No outdated wikis. No copying commands into your shell.
No having to scour random blogs for useful tools. You just clone the
repository, run a command, see what you can do, and get stuff done. Your
shell-literate grandmother could do it.</p>
<p>Mach should be your springboard to in-tree developer tools and increased
productivity. You shouldn't need anything except a copy of the source
tree and mach.</p>
<p>Like Git and Mercurial, mach is powered by the concept of
sub-commands/actions. So, one simply needs to register a new sub-command
with the mach driver. This involves writing a Python class. Once you do
that, people can discover and use that functionality. All batteries are
included with a copy of mozilla-central.</p>
<p>As stated above, the current set of commands is rather small. But, the
sky is the limit. Here are some of my ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to upload, download, and apply patches from Bugzilla (Burak
  YiÄŸit Kaya, Jeff Hammel, Clint Talbert and I have already talked about
  this -- progress tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774141">bug 774141</a>).</li>
<li>Automatically configure Mercurial with optimal settings (ensure user
  info is set, proper lines of diff context, enable mqext, etc). Tracked
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=794580">bug 794580</a>.</li>
<li>Submit Try builds. The <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/trychooser">trychooser</a>
  Mercurial extension could easily live as a mach subcommand! Tracked in
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774137">bug 774137</a>.</li>
<li>Identify Bugzilla components and/or reviewers from files touched by
  patch. It's all in the history of the touched files and the history of
  the old bugs referenced by those commits!
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774145">Bug 774145</a>.</li>
<li>Interaction with the <em>self-serve</em> build API. That thing on TBPL to
  control individual builds - we could make a CLI interface for it.
  (Steve Fink and/or Jeff Hammel already have
  <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/josh_joshmatthews.net/self-serve-tools">code</a>
  for this - it just needs to be integrated).
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774147">Bug 774147</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an idea for a feature, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug</a>.
Please note there are many features on file already. However, some
obvious ones such as integration with missing test suites have yet to be
filed (at least at the time I wrote this post).</p>
<p>If you wrote an awesome developer tool and would like others to use it
(without having to rely on people discovering it by reading a corner of the
Internet), add it to mach! Use mach as a wedge to get more exposure and
users. File a bug. I will happily r+ patches that add useful developer
functionality to the tree.</p>
<h2>What this Means / Longer Term Future</h2>
<p>While there is no timetable, mach will eventually replace <em>client.mk</em>.
client.mk, like mach, is essentially a CLI driver for the build
system. Having the driver implemented in Python rather than make has many
compelling advantages. I could probably write a whole post on it, but
I'll spare the world from my ranting.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all means that you may want to start re-training your
muscle memory now. Stop typing <em>make</em> and start typing <em>mach</em>. If you
need to type <em>make</em> because mach does not provide a feature, this is a
missing feature from mach.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">File a bug</a>
and request a new mach feature!</p>
<p>I want to condition people to stop typing <em>make</em>, especially in the object
directory. There are drastic changes to the build system in the works
(<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841">bug 784841</a> is
the tip of the iceburg). These changes will require the build system to
be treated as a black box. So, things like invoking make from the object
directory will eventually break. You'll need to go through an
intelligent tool to invoke the build system. Mach will be that tool.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>I would like to single out the following individuals for helping to land
mach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeff Hammel for doing the bulk of the reviewing. He shares my vision
  for mach and how it will make the overall developer experience much
  more pleasant and how this will translate to better things for The
  Project. In my mind, Jeff deserves as much credit for landing mach as
  I do.</li>
<li>Mike Hommey and Ms2ger for review help. Mike Hommey helped identify a
  lot of issues with build system integration. Ms2ger provided lots of
  general feedback on Python issues and API design.</li>
<li>Mike Connor (my manager) for allowing me to work on this. It's not
  related to my job description in any way so he <em>could</em> say I shouldn't
  be spending time on this. But, he realizes the positive impact this can
  have and has been supportive of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you find mach useful!</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>If you've looked at the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build">build instructions</a>
for Firefox lately, you may have noticed something new: support for
system bootstrapping!</p>
<p>Now checked in to mozilla-central is a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozboot/">framework</a>
for ensuring your system is capable of building mozilla-central and
Firefox. You just need to download and run a single Python script and it
performs magic.</p>
<p>Kudos go out to a community contributor, kmm (name wasn't revealed) for
doing the legwork for tracking down and verifying things worked on all
the Linux distros. Richard Newman and Jeff Hammel also helped with code
reviews. Just hours after it landed, Landry Breuil contributed support
for OpenBSD!</p>
<p>Currently, bootstrapping works for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>CentOS 6.x</li>
<li>Fedora</li>
<li>OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8</li>
<li>OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add support for an additional OS, please file a
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">Core : Build Config</a>
bug. Likewise, if you encounter an issue, please file a bug so others
don't get tripped up by it!</p>
<p>Bootstrap support is definitely in its infancy. It still needs features
like better prompting and opportunities for user choice (e.g. support
MacPorts on OS X - currently it only works with Homebrew). But, I think
it is much better than what existed previously, especially on OS X.</p>
<p>I consider this bootstrapping component just one piece in a larger
mission to make developing and building Firefox (and other Gecko
applications) easier. This should (hopefully) lead to more development
involvement. The next component to land will likely be
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2012/07/25/mozilla-build-system-plan-of-attack">mach</a>.
It's (finally) been getting some review love (thanks Jeff Hammel!), so
I'm optimistic it will land in the next few weeks.</p>
