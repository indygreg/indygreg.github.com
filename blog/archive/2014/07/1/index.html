  <p>Hey there, Firefox developer! Do you use Mercurial? Please take the time
right now to run <strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> from your Firefox clone.</p>
<p>It's been updated to ensure you are running a modern Mercurial version.
More awesomely, it has support for a couple of new extensions to make
you more productive. I think you'll like what you see.</p>
<p><strong>mach mercurial-setup</strong> doesn't change your <em>hgrc</em> without
confirmation. So it is safe to run to see what's available. You should
consider running it periodically, say once a week or so. I wouldn't
be surprised if we add a notification to mach to remind you to do this.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I was editing a wiki page yesterday and I think I coined a new term
which I'd like to enter the common nomenclature: <em>repository-centric
development</em>. The term refers to development/version control
workflows that place repositories - not patches - first.</p>
<p>When collaborating on version controlled code with modern tools like
Git and Mercurial, you essentially have two choices on how to
share version control data: patches or repositories.</p>
<p>Patches have been around since the dawn of version control. Everyone
knows how they work: your version control system has a copy of
the canonical data and it can export a view of a specific change
into what's called a patch. A patch is essentially a diff with
extra metadata.</p>
<p>When distributed version control systems came along, they brought
with them an alternative to patch-centric development:
repository-centric development. You could still exchange patches if you
wanted, but distributed version control allowed you to <em>pull</em> changes
directly from multiple <em>repositories</em>. You weren't limited to a single
master server (that's what the <em>distributed</em> in <em>distributed version
control</em> means). You also didn't have to go through an intermediate
transport such as email to exchange patches: you communicate directly
with a peer repository instance.</p>
<p>Repository-centric development eliminates the <em>middle man</em> required
for patch exchange: instead of exchanging derived data, you exchange
the actual data, speaking the repository's native language.</p>
<p>One advantage of repository-centric development is it eliminates the
problem of patch non-uniformity. Patches come in many different flavors.
You have plain diffs. You have diffs with metadata. You have Git style
metadata. You have Mercurial style metadata. You can produce patches
with various lines of context in the diff. There are different methods
for handling binary content. There are different ways to express
file adds, removals, and renames. It's all a hot mess. Any system
that consumes patches needs to deal with the non-uniformity. Do you
think this isn't a problem in the real world? Think again. If you are
involved with an open source project that collects patches via email
or by uploading patches to a bug tracker, have you ever seen someone
accidentally upload a patch in the wrong format? That's patch
non-uniformity. New contributors to Firefox do this all the time. I
also see it in the Mercurial project. With repository-centric
development, patches never enter the picture, so patch non-uniformity
is a non-issue. (Don't confuse the superficial formatting of patches
with the content, such as an incorrect commit message format.)</p>
<p>Another advantage of repository-centric development is it makes the
act of exchanging data easier. Just have two repositories talk to
each other. This used to be difficult, but hosting services like
GitHub and Bitbucket make this easy. Contrast with patches, which
require hooking your version control tool up to wherever those patches
are located. The Linux Kernel, like so many other projects,
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">uses email for contributing changes</a>.
So now Git, Mercurial, etc all fulfill Zawinski's law. This means your
version control tool is talking to your inbox to send and receive code.
Firefox development uses Bugzilla to hold patches as attachments. So now your
version control tool needs to talk to your issue tracker. (Not the worst
idea in the world I will concede.) While, yes, the tools around using
email or uploading patches to issue trackers or whatever else you are
using to exchange patches exist and can work pretty well, the grim
reality is that these tools are all reinventing the wheel of repository
exchange and are solving a problem that has already been solved by
<em>git push</em>, <em>git fetch</em>, <em>hg pull</em>, <em>hg push</em>, etc. Personally, I would
rather <em>hg push</em> to a remote and have tools like issue trackers and
mailing lists pull directly from repositories. At least that way they
have a direct line into the source of truth and are guaranteed a
consistent output format.</p>
<p>Another area where direct exchange is huge is multi-patch commits
(<em>branches</em> in Git parlance) or where commit data is fragmented. When
pushing patches to email, you need to insert metadata saying which patch
comes after which. Then the email import tool needs to reassemble things
in the proper order (remember that the typical convention is one email
per patch and email can be delivered out of order). Not the most
difficult problem in the world to solve. But seriously, it's been
solved already by <em>git fetch</em> and <em>hg pull</em>! Things are worse for
Bugzilla. There is no bullet-proof way to order patches there. The
convention at Mozilla is to add <em>Part N</em> strings to
commit messages and have the Bugzilla import tool do a sort (I assume it
does that). But what if you have a logical commit series spread across
multiple bugs? How do you reassemble everything into a linear series of
commits? You don't, sadly. Just today I wanted to apply a somewhat
complicated series of patches to the Firefox build system I was asked to
review so I could jump into a debugger and see what was going on so I
could conduct a more thorough review. There were 4 or 5 patches spread
over 3 or 4 bugs. Bugzilla and its patch-centric workflow prevented me
from importing the patches. Fortunately, this patch series was pushed to
Mozilla's Try server, so I could pull from there. But I haven't always
been so fortunate. This limitation means developers have to make
sacrifices such as writing fewer, larger patches (this makes code review
harder) or involving unrelated parties in the same bug and/or review.
In other words, deficient tools are imposing limited workflows. No bueno.</p>
<p>It is a fair criticism to say that not everyone can host a server or
that permissions and authorization are hard. Although I think concerns
about impact are overblown. If you are a small project, just create a
GitHub or Bitbucket account. If you are a larger project, realize that
people time is one of your largest expenses and invest in tools like
proper and efficient repository hosting (often this can be GitHub) to
reduce this waste and keep your developers happier and more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the clearest examples of repository-centric development is
GitHub. There are no patches in GitHub. Instead, you <em>git push</em>
and <em>git fetch</em>. Want to apply someone else's work? Just add a remote
and <em>git fetch</em>! Contrast with first locating patches, hooking up
Git to consume them (this part was always confusing to me - do you
need to retroactively have them sent to your email inbox so you can
import them from there), and finally actually importing them. Just
give me a URL to a repository already. But the benefits of
repository-centric development with GitHub don't stop at pushing and
pulling. GitHub has built code review functionality into pushes. They
call these <em>pull requests</em>. While I have significant issues with
GitHub's implemention of pull requests (I need to blog about those some
day), I can't deny the utility of the repository-centric workflow and
all the benefits around it. Once you switch to GitHub and its
repository-centric workflow, you more clearly see how lacking
patch-centric development is and quickly lose your desire to go back
to the 1990's state-of-the-art methods for software development.</p>
<p>I hope you now know what repository-centric development is and will join
me in championing it over patch-based development.</p>
<p>Mozillians reading this will be very happy to learn that work is under
way to shift Firefox's development workflow to a more repository-centric
world. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>My <a href="/blog/2014/06/23/please-stop-using-mq/">Please Stop Using MQ</a> post,
has been generating a lot of interest for bookmark-based workflows at
Mozilla. To make adoption easier, I
<a href="/blog/2014/06/30/track-firefox-repositories-with-local-only-mercurial-tags/">quickly authored</a>
an <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/default/hgext/firefoxtree/__init__.py">extension</a>
to add <em>remote refs</em> of Firefox repositories to Mercurial.</p>
<p>There was still a bit of confusion and gripes about workflows that I
thought it would be best to update the extension to make things more
pleasant.</p>
<h2>Automatic tree names</h2>
<p>People wanted an ability to easy pull/aggregate the various Firefox
trees without additional configuration to an hgrc file.</p>
<p>With <em>firefoxtree</em>, you can now <em>hg pull central</em> or <em>hg pull inbound</em>
or <em>hg pull aurora</em> and it just works.</p>
<p>Pushing with aliases doesn't yet work. It is slightly harder to do in
the Mercurial API. I have a solution, but I'm validating some code paths
to ensure it is safe. This feature will likely appear soon.</p>
<h2>fxheads commands</h2>
<p>Once people adopted unified repositories with heads from multiple
repositories, they asked how they could quickly identify the heads of
the pulled Firefox repositories.</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> now provides a <em>hg fxheads</em> command that prints a
concise output of the commits constituting the heads of the Firefox
repos. e.g.</p>
<div class="pygments_murphy"><pre><span></span>$ hg fxheads
<span class="m">224969</span>:0ec0b9ac39f0 aurora <span class="o">(</span>sort of<span class="o">)</span> bug <span class="m">898554</span> - raise expected hazard count <span class="k">for</span> b2g to <span class="m">4</span> <span class="k">until</span> they are fixed, <span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span>bustage+hazbuild-only

</pre></div>

<p>Please note that the output is based upon local-only knowledge: you'll
need to pull to ensure data is current.</p>
<h2>Reject pushing multiple heads</h2>
<p>People were complaining that bookmark-based workflows resulted in
Mercurial trying to push multiple heads to a remote. This complaint
stems from the fact that Mercurial's default push behavior is to find
all commits missing from the remote and push them. This behavior is
extremely frustrating for Firefox development because the Firefox repos
only have a single head and pushing multiple heads will only result in
a server hook rejecting the push (after wasting a lot of time
transferring that commit data).</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> now will refuse to push multiple heads to a known Firefox
repo before any commit data is sent. In other words, we fail fast so
your time is saved.</p>
<p><em>firefoxtree</em> also changes the default behavior of <em>hg push</em> when
pushing to a Firefox repo. If no <em>-r</em> argument is specified, <em>hg push</em>
to a Firefox repo will automatically remap to <em>hg push -r .</em>. In other
words, we attempt to push the working copy's commit by default. This
change establishes sensible default and likely working behavior when
typing just <em>hg push</em>.</p>
<p>I am a bit on the fence about changing the default behavior of <em>hg
push</em>. On one hand, it makes total sense. On the other, silently
changing the default behavior of a built-in command is a little
dangerous. I can easily see this backfiring when people interact with
non-Firefox repos. I encourage people to get in the habit of typing
<em>hg push -r <rev></em> because that's what you should be doing.</p>
<h2>Installing firefoxtree</h2>
<p>Within the next 48 hours, <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> should prompt to
install <em>firefoxtree</em>. Until then, clone
<em>https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools</em> and ensure your
<em>~/.hgrc</em> file has the following:</p>
<pre><code>[extensions]
firefoxtree = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/firefoxtree
</code></pre>
<p>You likely already have a copy of version-control-tools
in <em>~/.mozbuild/version-control-tools</em>.</p>
<p>It is completely safe to install <em>firefoxtree</em> globally: the extension
will only modify behavior of repositories that are clones of Firefox
repositories.</p>

  <p>Are you someone who casually interacts with Python but don't know the
inner workings of Python? Then this post is for you. Read on to learn
why some things are the way they are and how to avoid making some
common mistakes.</p>
<h2>Always use Virtualenvs</h2>
<p>It is an easy trap to view <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html">virtualenvs</a>
as an obstacle, a distraction towards accomplishing something. People
see me adding virtualenvs to build instructions and they say <em>I don't
use virtualenvs, they aren't necessary, why are you doing that?</em></p>
<p>A virtualenv is effectively an overlay on top of your system Python
install. Creating a virtualenv can be thought of as copying your system
Python environment into a local location. When you modify virtualenvs,
you are modifying an isolated container. Modifying virtualenvs has no
impact on your system Python.</p>
<p>A goal of a virtualenv is to isolate your system/global Python install
from unwanted changes. When you accidentally make a change to a
virtualenv, you can just delete the virtualenv and start over from
scratch. When you accidentally make a change to your system Python, it
can be much, much harder to recover from that.</p>
<p>Another goal of virtualenvs is to allow different versions of packages
to exist. Say you are working on two different projects and each
requires a specific version of Django. With virtualenvs, you install one
version in one virtualenv and a different version in another virtualenv.
Things happily coexist because the virtualenvs are independent.
Contrast with trying to manage both versions of Django in your system
Python installation. Trust me, it's not fun.</p>
<p>Casual Python users may not encounter scenarios where virtualenvs make
their lives better... until they do, at which point they realize their
system Python install is beyond saving. People who eat, breath, and die
Python run into these scenarios all the time. We've learned how bad life
without virtualenvs can be and so we use them everywhere.</p>
<p>Use of virtualenvs is a best practice. Not using virtualenvs will result
in something unexpected happening. It's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Please use virtualenvs.</p>
<h2>Never use sudo</h2>
<p>Do you use sudo to install a Python package? You are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>If you need to use sudo to install a Python package, that almost
certainly means you are installing a Python package to your
system/global Python install. And this means you are modifying your
system Python instead of isolating it and keeping it pristine.</p>
<p>Instead of using sudo to install packages, create a virtualenv and
install things into the virtualenv. There should never be permissions
issues with virtualenvs - the user that creates a virtualenv has full
realm over it.</p>
<h2>Never modify the system Python environment</h2>
<p>On some systems, such as OS X with Homebrew, you don't need sudo to
install Python packages because the user has write access to the Python
directory (<em>/usr/local</em> in Homebrew).</p>
<p>For the reasons given above, don't muck around with the system Python
environment. Instead, use a virtualenv.</p>
<h2>Beware of the package manager</h2>
<p>Your system's package manager (apt, yum, etc) is likely using root and/or
installing Python packages into the system Python.</p>
<p>For the reasons given above, this is bad. Try to use a virtualenv, if
possible. Try to not use the system package manager for installing
Python packages.</p>
<h2>Use pip for installing packages</h2>
<p>Python packaging has historically been a mess. There are a handful of
tools and APIs for installing Python packages. As a casual Python user,
you only need to know of one of them:
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/">pip</a>.</p>
<p>If someone says <em>install a package</em>, you should be thinking <em>create a
virtualenv, activate a virtualenv, <code>pip install &lt;package&gt;</code></em>. <strong>You
should never run <code>pip install</code> outside of a virtualenv.</strong> (The exception
is to install virtualenv and pip itself, which you almost certainly want
in your system/global Python.)</p>
<p>Running <em>pip install <package></em> will install packages from
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, the Python Packaging Index by
default. It's Python's official package repository.</p>
<p>There are a lot of old and outdated tutorials online about Python
packaging. Beware of bad content. For example, if you see documentation
that says <em>use easy_install</em>, you should be thinking, <em>easy_install is
a legacy package installer that has largely been replaced by pip, I
should use pip instead</em>. When in doubt, consult the
<a href="https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Python packaging user guide</a>
and do what it recommends.</p>
<h2>Don't trust the Python in your package manager</h2>
<p>The more Python programming you do, the more you learn to not trust the
Python package provided by your system / package manager.</p>
<p>Linux distributions such as Ubuntu that sit on the forward edge of
versions are better than others. But I've run into enough problems with
the OS or package manager maintained Python (especially on OS X), that
I've learned to distrust them.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a> for installing and managing
Python distributions from source. pyenv also installs virtualenv and
pip for me, packages that I believe should be in all Python installs
by default. As a more experienced Python programmer, I find pyenv 
<em>just works</em>.</p>
<p>If you are just a beginner with Python, it is probably safe to ignore
this section. Just know that as soon as something weird happens, start
suspecting your default Python install, especially if you are on OS X.
If you suspect trouble, use something like pyenv to enforce a buffer so
the system can have its Python and you can have yours.</p>
<h2>Recovering from the past</h2>
<p>Now that you know the preferred way to interact with Python, you are
probably thinking <em>oh crap, I've been wrong all these years - how do I
fix it?</em></p>
<p>The goal is to get a Python install <em>somewhere</em> that is as pristine as
possible. You have two approaches here: cleaning your existing Python or
creating a new Python install.</p>
<p>To clean your existing Python, you'll want to purge it of pretty much
all packages not installed by the core Python distribution. The
exception is virtualenv, pip, and setuptools - you almost certainly want
those installed globally. On Homebrew, you can uninstall everything related to
Python and blow away your Python directory, typically
/usr/local/lib/python*. Then, <em>brew install python</em>. On Linux distros,
this is a bit harder, especially since most Linux distros rely on Python
for OS features and thus they may have installed extra packages. You
could try a similar approach on Linux, but I don't think it's worth it.</p>
<p>Cleaning your system Python and attempting to keep it pure are ongoing
tasks that are very difficult to keep up with. All it takes is one
dependency to get pulled in that trashes your system Python. Therefore,
I shy away from this approach.</p>
<p>Instead, I install and run Python from my user directory. I use
<a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a>. I've also heard great things
about <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>. With either
solution, you get a Python in your home directory that starts clean and
pure. Even better, it is completely independent from your system Python.
So if your package manager does something funky, there is a buffer. And,
if things go wrong with your userland Python install, you can always
nuke it without fear of breaking something in system land. This seems to
be the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Please note that installing packages in the system Python shouldn't be
evil. When you create virtualenvs, you can - and should - tell
virtualenv to not use the system site-packages (i.e. <em>don't use
non-core packages from the system installation</em>). This is the default
behavior in virtualenv. It should provide an adequate buffer. But from
my experience, things still manage to bleed through. My userland Python
install is extra safety. If something wrong happens, I can only blame
myself.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Python's long and complicated history of package management makes it
very easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot. The long list of
outdated tutorials on The Internet make this a near certainty for casual
Python users. Using the guidelines in this post, you can adhere to best
practices that will cut down on surprises and rage and keep your Python
running smoothly.</p>
