  <p>I recently gained SSH access to Mozilla's Mercurial servers. This allows
me to run some custom queries directly against the data. I was
interested in some high-level numbers and thought I'd share the results.</p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org hosts a total of 3,445 repositories. Of these, there are
1,223 distinct root commits (i.e. distinct graphs). Altogether, there
are 32,123,211 commits. Of those, there are 865,594 distinct commits (not
double counting commits that appear in multiple repositories).</p>
<p>We have a high ratio of total commits to distinct commits (about 37:1).
This means we have high duplication of data on disk. This basically
means a lot of repos are clones/forks of existing ones. No big surprise
there.</p>
<p>What is surprising to me is the low number of total distinct commits. I
was expecting the number to run into the millions. (Firefox itself
accounts for ~240,000 commits.) Perhaps a lot of the data is sitting in
Git, Bitbucket, and GitHub. Sounds like a good data mining expedition...</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When companies or organizations deploy version control, they have to
make many choices. One of them is how many repositories to create.
Your choices are essentially a) a single, monolithic repository that
holds everything b) many separate, smaller repositories that hold
all the individual parts c) something in between.</p>
<p>The prevailing convention today (especially in the open source
realm) is to create many separate and loosely coupled repositories,
each repository mapping to a specific product or service. That does
seem reasonable: if you were organizing files on your filesystem,
you would group them by functionality or role (photos, music,
documents, etc). And, version control tools are functionally
filesystems. So it makes sense to draw repository boundaries at
directory/role levels.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the separate repository convention is the
scaling behavior of our version control tools. Git, the popular
tool in open source these days, doesn't scale well to very large
repositories due to - among other things - not having narrow clones
(fetching a subset of files). It scales well enough to the
overwhelming majority of projects. But if you are a large
organization generating lots of data (read: gigabytes of data over
hundreds of thousands of files and commits) for version control,
Git is unsuitable in its current form. Other tools (like Mercurial)
don't currently fare that much better (although Mercurial has plans
to tackle these scaling vectors).</p>
<p>Despite popular convention and even limitations in tools, companies
like Google and Facebook opt to run large, monolithic repositories.
Google runs Perforce.
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook is on Mercurial</a>,
or at least is in the process of migrating to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Why do these companies run monolithic repositories?
In <a href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Google's words</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have a single large depot with almost all of Google's projects
on it. This aids agile development and is much loved by our users,
since it allows almost anyone to easily view almost any code, allows
projects to share code, and allows engineers to move freely from
project to project. Documentation and data is stored on the server
as well as code.</em></p>
<p>So, monolithic repositories are all about moving fast and getting things
done more efficiently. In other words, <strong>monolithic repositories
increase developer productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, monolithic repositories are also more compatible with
the ebb and flow of large organizations and large software projects.
Components, features, products, and teams come and go, merge and split.
The only constant is change. And if you are maintaining separate
repositories that attempt to map to this ever-changing organizational
topology, you are going to have a bad time. Either you'll be
constantly copying, moving, merging, splitting, etc data and repositories.
Or your repositories will be organized in a very non-logical and
non-intuitive manner. That translates to overhead and lost productivity.
I think that monolithic repositories handle the realities of large
organizations much better. Big change or reorganization you want
to reflect? You can make a single, atomic, history-preserving commit
to move things around. I think that's much more manageable, especially
when you consider the difficulty and annoyance of history-preserving
changes across repositories.</p>
<p>Naysayers will decry monolithic repositories on principled and practical
grounds.</p>
<p>The principled camp will say that separate repositories
constitute a loosely coupled (dare I say service oriented) architecture
that maps better to how software is consumed, assembled, and deployed
and that erecting barriers in the form of separate repositories
deliberately enforces this architecture. I agree. However, you can
still maintain a loosely coupled architecture with monolithic
repositories. The Subversion model of checking out a single tree
<em>from a larger repository</em> proves this. Furthermore, I would say
architecture decisions should be enforced by people (via code review,
etc), not via version control repository topology. I believe this
principled argument against monolithic repositories to be rather weak.</p>
<p>The principled camp living in the open source realm may also decry
monolithic repositories as an affront to the spirit of open source.
They would say that a monolithic repository creates unfairly strong
ties to the organization that operates it and creates barriers to
forking, etc. This may be true. But monolithic repositories don't
intrinsically infringe on the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">basic software freedoms</a>,
organizations do. Therefore, I find this principled argument rather
weak.</p>
<p>The practical camp will say that monolithic repositories just don't
scale or aren't suitable for general audiences. These concerns are
real.</p>
<p><em>Fully</em> distributed version control systems (every commit on every
machine) definitely don't scale past certain limits. Depending on your
repository and user base, your scaling limits include disk space
(repository data terabytes in size), bandwidth (repository data terabytes
in size), filesystem (repository hundreds of thousands or millions of
files), CPU and memory (operations on large repositories take too
many system resources), and many heads/branches (tools like Git and
Mercurial don't scale well to tens of thousands of heads/branches).
These limitations with fully distributed version
control are why distributed version control tools like Git and
Mercurial support a partially-distributed mode that behaves more like
your classical server-client model, like those employed by Subversion,
Perforce, etc. Git supports shallow clone and sparse checkout.
Mercurial supports shallow clone (via remotefilelog) and has planned
support for narrow clone and sparse checkout by the end of 2015.
Of course, you can avoid the scaling limitations of distributed
version control by employing a non-distributed tool, such as Subversion.
Many companies continue to reach this conclusion today. However,
users adapted to the distributed workflow would likely be
up in arms (they would probably use tools like hg-subversion or git-svn
to maintain their workflows). So, while scaling of version control
can be a real concern, there are solutions and workarounds. However,
they do involve falling back to a partially-distributed model.</p>
<p>Another concern with monolithic repositories is user access control. You
inevitably have code or data that is more sensitive and want to limit
who can change or even access it. Separate repositories seem to
facilitate a simpler model: per-repository access control. With
monolithic repositories, you have to worry about per-directory/subtree
permissions, an increased risk of data leaking, etc. This concern is
more real with distributed version control, as distributed data and
access control aren't naturally compatible. But these issues can be
resolved. And if the tooling supports it, there is only a semantic
difference between managing access control between repositories versus
components of a single repository.</p>
<p>When it comes to repository hosting conversions, I agree with Google
and Facebook: <strong>I prefer monolithic repositories</strong>. When I am interacting
with version control, I just want to get stuff done. I don't want to
waste time dealing with multiple commands to manage multiple
repositories. I don't want to waste time or expend cognitive load
dealing with submodule, subrepository, or big files management. I
don't want to waste time trying to find and reuse code, data, or
documentation. I want everything at my fingertips, where it can be
easily discovered, inspected, and used. Monolithic repositories
facilitate these workflows more than separate repositories and make
me more productive as a result.</p>
<p>Now, if only all the tools and processes we use and love would work
with monolithic repositories...</p>

  <small>September 05, 2014 at 02:50 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Of of my first tasks in my
<a href="/blog/2014/09/05/new-job-role/">new role</a> as a <em>Developer Productivity
Engineer</em> is to help make Mozilla's Mercurial server better. Many of the
awesome things we have planned rely on features in newer versions of
Mercurial. It's therefore important for us to upgrade our Mercurial
server to a modern version (we are currently running 2.5.4) and to keep
our Mercurial server upgraded as time passes.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why we haven't historically upgraded our
Mercurial server. First, as anyone who has maintained high-availability
systems will tell you, there is the attitude of <em>if it isn't broken,
don't fix it.</em> In other words, Mercurial 2.5.4 is working fine, so why
mess with a good thing. This was all fine and dandy - until Mercurial
started falling over in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>But the blocker towards upgrading that I want to talk about today is
systems verification. There has been extreme caution around upgrading
Mercurial at Mozilla because it is a critical piece of Mozilla's
infrastructure and if the upgrade were to not go well, the outage
would be disastrous for developer productivity and could even jeopardize
an emergency Firefox release.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like to say that a modern version of Mercurial on the
server would be a drop-in replacement (Mercurial has a great committment
to backwards compatibility and has loose coupling between clients and
servers such that upgrading servers should not impact clients), there is
always a risk that something will change. And that risk is compounded by
the amount of custom code we have running on our server.</p>
<p>The way you protect against unexpected changes is testing. In the ideal
world, you have a robust test suite that you run against a staging
instance of a service to validate that any changes have no impact. In
the absence of testing, you are left with fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
FUD is an especially horrible philosophy when it comes to managing
servers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have a great testing infrastructure for
Mozilla's Mercurial server. And I want to change that.</p>
<h2>Reproducing the Server Environment</h2>
<p>When writing tests, it is important for the thing being tested to be as
similar as possible to the real thing. This is why so many people have
an aversion to mocking: every time you alter the test environment, you run
the risk that those differences from reality will mask changes seen in
the real environment.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that a good first goal for creating a test suite against
our Mercurial server should be to reproduce the production server and
environment as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a Vagrant environment that attempts to
reproduce the official environment as closely as possible. It starts
one virtual machine for the SSH/master server. It starts a separate
virtual machine for the hgweb/slave servers. The virtual machines are
booting CentOS. This is different than production, where we run RHEL.
But they are similar enough (and can share the same packages) that the
differences shouldn't matter too much, at least for now.</p>
<h2>Using Puppet</h2>
<p>In production, Mozilla is using Puppet to manage the Mercurial servers.
Unfortunately, the actual Puppet configs that Mozilla is running are
behind a firewall, mainly for security reasons. This is potentially
a huge setback for my reproducibility effort, as I'd like to have
my virtual machines use the same exact Puppet configs as whats used
in production so the environments match as closely as possible. This
would also save me a lot of work from having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ben Kero has extracted the Mercurial-relevant Puppet
config files into a
<a href="https://github.com/bkero/puppet-module-hg">standalone repository</a>.
Apparently that repository gets rolled into the production Puppet
configs periodically. So, my virtual machines and production can share
the same Mercurial Puppet files. Nice!</p>
<p>It wasn't long after starting to use the standalone Puppet configs that
I realized this would be a rabbit hole. This first manifests in the
standalone Puppet code referencing things that exist in the hidden
Mozilla Puppet files. So the liberation was only partially successful.
Sad panda.</p>
<p>So, I'm now in the process of creating a <em>fake Mozilla</em> Puppet
environment that mimics the base Mozilla environment (from the closed
repo) and am modifying the shared Puppet Mercurial code to work with
both versions. This is a royal pain, but it needs to be done if we want
to reproduce production and maintain peace of mind that test results
reflect reality.</p>
<p>Because reproducing runtime environments is important for reproducing
and solving bugs and for testing, <strong>I call on the maintainers of
Mozilla's closed Puppet repository to liberate it from behind its
firewall</strong>. I'd like to see a public Puppet configuration tree available
for all to use so that anyone anywhere can reproduce the state of a
server or service operated by Mozilla to within reasonable
approximation. Had this already been done, it would have saved me hours
of work. As it stands, I'm reverse engineering systems and trying to
cobble together understanding of how the Mozilla Puppet configs
work and what parts of them can safely be ignored to reproduce an
approximate testing environment.</p>
<p>Along that vein, I finally got access to Mozilla's internal Puppet
repository. This took a few meetings and apparently a lot of
backroom chatter was generated - "developer's don't normally get access,
oh my!" All I wanted was to see how systems are configured so I can
help improve them. Instead, getting access felt like pulling teeth.
This feels like a major roadblock towards productivity, reproducibility,
and testing.</p>
<p>Facebook gives its developers access to most production machines and
trusts them to not be stupid. I know we (Mozilla) like to hold
ourselves to a high standard of security and privacy. But not giving
developers access to the configurations for the systems their code
runs on feels like a very silly policy. I hope Mozilla invests in
opening up this important code and data, if not to the world, at least
to its trusted employees.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully I'll soon have a Vagrant environment that allows
people to build a standalone instance of Mozilla's Mercurial server.
And once that's in place, I can start writing tests that basic services
and workflows (including repository syncing) work as expected. Stay
tuned.</p>

  <p>As of today, I have a new role and title at Mozilla: <em>Developer
Productivity Engineer</em>. I'll be reporting to Laura Thomson as a
member of the <em>Developer Services</em> team.</p>
<p>I have an immediate goal to make our version control work better.
This includes making Try scale and helping out with the deployment
of ReviewBoard. After that, I'm not entirely sure. But Autoland
and Firefox build system improvements have been discussed.</p>
<p>I'm really excited to be in this new role. If someone were to give me
a clean slate and tell me to design my own job role, I think I'd
answer with something very similar to the role I am now in. I am
