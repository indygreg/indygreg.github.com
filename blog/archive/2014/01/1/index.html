  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Some Mozillians recently stood up an
<a href="https://reviewboard.allizom.org/">instance</a> of
<a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a> - a web-based code review
tool for evaluation purposes. Having used Review Board at a previous
company, I can say with high confidence that when properly configured,
it beats the pants off Splinter (the code review interface baked into
Bugzilla). Here are some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTML interface is more pleasant on the eyes (subjective).</li>
<li>Interdiffs actually work.</li>
<li>Intra-line diffs are rendered.</li>
<li>You can open <em>issues</em> for individual review comments and these
  issues can be tracked during subsequent reviews (Bugzilla doesn't
  really have anything similar and review comments tend to get lost
  unless the reviewer is sharp).</li>
<li>It integrates with the VCS, so you can expand code context from the
  review interface.</li>
<li>There are buttons to toggle whitespace differences.</li>
<li>Syntax hightlighting! It even recognizes things like <em>TODO</em> in
  comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more from the <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/1.7/users/">official user guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in evaluating Review Board, the easiest way
to upload patches to Mozilla's instance is to run <strong>mach rbt</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mach rbt</strong> will launch the Review Board tools command-line client
(called RBTools). From there, you can do a number of things. Run
<strong>mach rbt help</strong> to see the full list.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code># See a diff that would be uploaded to Review Board:
$ mach rbt diff

# Create a review request based on the current Mercurial changeset:
$ mach rbt post

# That should print out a URL to the not-yet-published review
# request. If you go to that URL, you'll notice that the fields
# in that request are all empty.

# Next time, you can have some fields auto-populate by running:
$ mach rbt post --guess-summary --guess-description

# This grabs info from the commit message.

# To update an existing review request (e.g. to submit a new patch):
$ mach rbt post -r &lt;review id&gt;

# (where &lt;review ID&gt; is the ID of the review).

# You can also have it generate a "squashed" patch from multiple
# commits:
$ mach rbt post 164123::164125
</code></pre>
<p>Run <strong>mach rbt help post</strong> for more options. Also see the
<a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/docs/rbtools/dev/">RBTools documentation</a>
for more.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <strong>mach rbt</strong> will download an unreleased version
of RBTools. This is because the released version doesn't work well with
Mercurial. I contributed a handful of patches to RBTools to make
Mercurial work better.</p>
<p>Before you dive in and start using Review Board for actual code review,
there are some things you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla's Review Board instance does not yet send emails on changes.
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=958236">Bug 958236</a>
  tracks this. When it works, you'll see nice emails, just like you do
  for Bugzilla reviews.</li>
<li>Review Board doesn't currently interact with Bugzilla that well. In
  theory, we could have Review Board update corresponding Bugzilla bugs
  when actions are performed. Someone just needs to write this code
  and get it deployed.</li>
<li>If you create a Bugzilla attachment that contains the URL of a Review
  Board review (e.g. https://reviewboard.allizom.org/r/23/), Bugzilla
  will automatically set the MIME type as a Review Board review and set
  up an HTML redirect when the attachment is <em>downloaded</em> via the
  browser. You can even set <strong>r?</strong> on this attachment to have Bugzilla
  nag about reviews. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=875562">bug 875562</a>
  for an example.</li>
<li>There is currently no way to upload a patch to Review Board and update
  Bugzilla is one go. I have proof-of-concept code for this. Although,
  there is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947596">pushback</a>
  on getting that checked in.</li>
<li>Review Board 2 is in development. It has a number of new and exciting
  features. And it looks better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally and most importantly, <strong>Review Board at Mozilla is still in
evaluation mode.</strong> It's usage has not been officially blessed as far
as I know. I don't believe the SLA is as high as other services (like
Bugzilla). Nobody is really using it yet. It still needs a lot of
polish and integration for it to realize its potential. And, there is
some <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=947596">talk</a>
about the future of code review at Mozilla that may or may not involve
Review Board. In short, the future of Review Board at Mozilla is
uncertain. I wouldn't rely on it to archive review comments from super
important reviews/decisions.</p>
<p>Despite the shortcomings, I encourage people to play around with Review
Board. If nothing else, at least <a href="https://reviewboard.allizom.org/r/24/diff/">gaze upon it's patch rendering
beauty</a> and witness
what the future could hold.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Over the winter break, I set out on an ambitious project to create
a service to help developers and others manage the flury
of patches going into Firefox. While the project is far from complete,
I'm ready to unleash the first part of the project upon the world.</p>
<p>If you point your browsers to
<a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/">moztree.gregoryszorc.com</a>, you'll
hopefully see some documentation about what I've built.
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/moz-tree-utopia">Source code</a> is
available and free, of course. Patches very welcome.</p>
<p>Essentially, I built a centralized indexing service for version
control repositories with Mozilla's extra metadata thrown in.
I tell it what repositories to mirror, and it clones everything,
fetches data such as the pushlog and Git SHA-1 mappings, and
stores everything in a central database. It then exposes this
aggregated data through world-readable web services.</p>
<p>Currently, I have the service indexing the popular project branches
for Firefox (central, aurora, beta, release, esr, b2g, inbound, fx-team,
try, etc). You can view the
<a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/repos">full list</a> via the web
service. As a bonus, I'm also serving these repositories via
<a href="http://hg.gregoryszorc.com/">hg.gregoryszorc.com</a>. My server appears
to be significantly faster than
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org">hg.mozilla.org</a>. If you want to use it for
your daily needs, go for it. I make no SLA guarantees, however.</p>
<p>I'm also using this service as an opportunity to experiment with
alternate forms of Mercurial hosting. I have mirrors of mozilla-central
and the try repository with generaldelta and lz4 compression enabled.
I may blog about what those are eventually. The teaser is that they can
make Mercurial perform a lot faster under some conditions. I'm also
using ZFS under the hood to manage repositories. Each repository is a
ZFS filesystem. This means I can create repository copies on the server
(user repositories anyone?) at a nearly free cost. Contrast this to the
traditional method of full clones, which take lots of time, memory, CPU,
and storage.</p>
<p>Anyway, some things you can do with the existing web service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain metadata about Mercurial changesets.
  <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/changeset/940b2974f35b">Example</a>.</li>
<li>Look up metadata about Git commits.
  <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/git-sha1/40438af67c321">Example</a>.</li>
<li>Obtain a <a href="http://moztree.gregoryszorc.com/api/spore">SPORE descriptor</a>
  describing the web service endpoints. This allows you to auto-generate
  clients from descriptors. Yay!</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, that's not a lot. But adding new endpoints is relatively
straightforward. See the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/indygreg/moz-tree-utopia/src/tip/repodata/web/app.py">source</a>.
It's literally as easy as defining a URL mapping and writing a
database query.</p>
<p>The performance is also not the best. I just haven't put in the effort
to tune things yet. All of the querying hits the database, not
Mercurial. So, making things faster should merely be a matter of
database and hosting optimization. Patches welcome!</p>
<p>Some ideas that I haven't had time to implement yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return changests in a specific repository</li>
<li>Return recently pushed changesets</li>
<li>Return pushes for a given user</li>
<li>Return commits for a given author</li>
<li>Return commits referencing a given bug</li>
<li>Obtain TBPL URLs for pushes with changeset</li>
<li>Integrate bugzilla metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>Once those are in place, I foresee this service powering a number of
dashboards. Patches welcome.</p>
<p>Again, this service is only the tip of what's possible. There's a lot
that could be built on this service. I have ideas. Others have ideas.</p>
<p>The project includes a Vagrant file and Puppet
manifests for provisioning the server. It's a one-liner to get a
development environment up and running. It should be really easy to
contribute to this project. Patches welcome.</p>

  <small>January 17, 2014 at 03:00 PM | categories: 

<a href='/blog/category/mercurial'>Mercurial</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As I've <a href="/blog/category/mercurial/">written before</a>, Mercurial is a
highly extensible version control system. You can do things with
Mercurial you can't do in other version control systems.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll outline some of the cool things Mozilla could do with
Mercurial. But first, I want to outline some features of Mercurial that
many don't know exist.</p>
<h2>pushkey and listkeys command</h2>
<p>The Mercurial wire protocol (how two Mercurial peer repositories
talk to each other over a network) contains two very useful commands:
<em>pushkey</em> and <em>listkeys</em>. These commands allow the storage and listing
of arbitrary key-value pair metadata in the repository.</p>
<p>This generic storage mechanism is how Mercurial stores and synchronizes
bookmarks and phases information, for example.</p>
<p>By implementing a Mercurial extension, you can have Mercurial store
key-value data for any arbitrary data namespace. You can then write
a simple extension that synchronizes this data as part of the push
and pull operations.</p>
<h2>Extending the wire protocol</h2>
<p>For cases where you want to transmit arbitrary data to/from Mercurial
servers and where the <em>pushkey</em> framework isn't robust enough, it's
possible to implement custom commands in the Mercurial wire protocol.</p>
<p>A server installs an extension making the commands available. A client
installs an extension knowing how to use the commands. Arbitrary data
is transferred or custom actions are performed.</p>
<p>When it comes to custom commands, the sky is really the limit. You
could do pretty much anything from transfer extra data types (this
is how the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LargefilesExtension">largefiles extension</a>
works) to writing commands that interact with remote agents.</p>
<h2>Custom revision set queries and templating</h2>
<p>Mercurial offers a rich framework for querying repository data and
for formatting data. The querying is called <em>revision sets</em> and the
later <em>templates</em>. If you are unfamiliar with the feature, I
encourage you to run <em>hg help revset</em> and <em>hg help templates</em> right
now to discover the awesomeness.</p>
<p>As I've <a href="/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/">demonstrated</a>,
you can do some very nifty things with custom revision sets and
templating!</p>
<h2>The possibilities</h2>
<p>Now that you know some ways Mercurial can be extended, let's talk about
some cool use cases at Mozilla. I want to be clear that I'm not
advocating we do these things, just that they are possible and maybe
they are a little cool.</p>
<h3>Storing pushlog data</h3>
<p>Mozilla records information about who pushed what changesets where and
when in what's called the <em>pushlog</em>. The pushlog data is currently
stored in a SQLite database inside the repository on the server. The
data is made available via a HTTP+JSON API.</p>
<p>We could go a step further and make the pushlog data available via
<em>listkeys</em> so Mercurial clients could download pushlog data with the
same channel used to pull core repository data. (Currently, we have
to open a new TCP connection and talk to the HTTP+JSON API.) This
would make fetching of pushlog data faster, especially for clients
on slow connections.</p>
<p>I concede this is an iterative improvement and adds little value beyond
what we currently have. But if I were designing pushlog storage from
scratch, this is how I'd do it.</p>
<h3>Storing a changeset's automation results</h3>
<p>The <em>pushkey</em> framework could be used to mark specific changesets
as passing automation. When release automation or a sheriff determines
that a changeset/push is green, they could issue an authenticated
<em>pushkey</em> command to the Mercurial server stating such. Clients
could then easily obtain a list of all changesets that are green.</p>
<p>Why stop there? We could also record automation failures in Mercurial as
well. Depending on how complex this gets, we may outgrow <em>pushkey</em>
and require a separate command. But that's all doable.</p>
<p>Anyway, clients could download automation results for a specific
changeset as part of the repository data. The same extension that
pulls down that data could also monkeypatch the bisection algorithm used
by <em>hg bisect</em> to automatically skip over changesets that didn't pass
automation. You'll never bisect a backed out changeset again!</p>
<p>If this automation data were stored on the Try repository, the autoland
tool would just need to query the Mercurial repo to see which changesets
are candidates for merging into mainline - there would be no need for
a separate database and web service!</p>
<h3>Marking a changeset as reviewed</h3>
<p>Currently, Mozilla's review procedure is very patch and Bugzilla
centric. But it doesn't have to be that way. (I argue it shouldn't be
that way.)</p>
<p>Imagine a world where code review is initiated by pushing changesets
to a special server, kind of like how Try magically turns pushes into
automation jobs.</p>
<p>In this world, reviews could be initiated by issuing a <em>pushkey</em>
or custom command to the server. This could even initiate
server-side static analysis that would hold off publishing the review
unless static analysis checks passed!</p>
<p>Granted review could be recorded by having someone issue a
<em>pushkey</em> command to mark a changeset as reviewed. The channel to the
Mercurial server is authenticated via SSH, so the user behind the
current SSH key is the reviewer. The Mercurial server could store this
username as part of the repository data. The autoland tool could then
pull down the reviewer data and only consider changesets that have an
appropriate reviewer.</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> also be possible to integrate crypto magic into this
workflow so reviewers could digitally sign a changeset as reviewed.
This could help with the verification of the Firefox source code
that Brendan Eich <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/01/trust-but-verify/">recently outlined</a>.</p>
<p>Like the automation data above, no separate
database would be required: all data would be part of the repository.
All you need to build is a Mercurial extension.</p>
<h3>Encouraging best practices</h3>
<p>Mozillians have written a handful of useful Mercurial extensions to
help people become more productive. We have also noticed that many
developers are still (unknowingly?) running old, slow, and buggy
Mercurial releases. We want people to have the best experience possible.
How do we do that?</p>
<p>One idea is to install an extension on the server that strongly
recommands or even requires users follow best practices (minimal HG
version, installed extensions, etc).</p>
<p>I have developed a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=941856">proof-of-concept</a>
that does just this.</p>
<h3>Rich querying of metadata</h3>
<p>When you start putting more metadata into Mercurial (or at least write
Mercurial extensions to aggregate this metadata), all kinds of
interesting query opportunities open up. Using revsets and templates,
you can do an awful lot to use Mercurial as a database of sorts
to extract useful reports.</p>
<p>I dare say reports like
<a href="http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/12/03/infrastructure-load-for-november-2013/">John O'duinn's Monthly Infrastructure Load</a>
posts could be completely derived from Mercurial. I've
<a href="/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/">demonstrated</a>
this ability previously. That's only the tip of the iceburg.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We could enable a lot of new and useful scenarios by extending
Mercurial. We could accomplish this without introducing new
services and tools into our already complicated infrastructure
and workflows.</p>
<p>The possibilities I've suggested are by no means exhaustive. I encourage
others to dream up new and interesting ideas. Who knows, maybe some of
them may actually happen.</p>

<a href='/blog/category/python'>Python</a>, <a href='/blog/category/mozilla'>Mozilla</a>
</small><p/>
  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I see a number of open source projects supporting old versions
of Python. Mercurial supports 2.4, for example. I have to ask: why do
projects continue to support old Python releases?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.4.6/">Python 2.4</a> was last
  released on December 19, 2008 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.4</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.5.6/">Python 2.5</a> was last
  released on May 26, 2011 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.5</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.6.9/">Python 2.6</a> was last
  released on October 29, 2013 and <strong>there will be no more releases of
  Python 2.6</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Everything before Python 2.7 is end-of-lifed</strong></li>
<li>Python 2.7 continues to see periodic releases, but mostly for bug fixes.</li>
<li>Practically all of the work on CPython is happening in the 3.3 and 3.4
  branches. Other implementations continue to support 2.7.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 has been available since July 2010</li>
<li>Python 2.7 provides some very compelling language features over
  earlier releases that developers want to use</li>
<li>It's much easier to write dual compatible 2/3 Python when 2.7 is the
  only 2.x release considered.</li>
<li>Python 2.7 can be installed in userland relatively easily (see
  projects like <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv">pyenv</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these facts, I'm not sure why projects insist on supporting old
and end-of-lifed Python releases.</p>
<p><strong>I think maintainers of Python projects should seriously consider
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below.</strong> Are there really that many
people on systems that don't have Python 2.7 easily available? Why are
we Python developers inflicting so much pain on ourselves to support
antiquated Python releases?</p>
<p>As a data point, I successfully transitioned Firefox's build system
from requiring Python 2.5+ to 2.7.3+ and it was relatively
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/djN02O03APc/OS8A9LuHX0sJ">pain</a>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870420">free</a>.
Sure, a few people complained. But as far as I know, not very many new
developers are coming in and complaining about the requirement.
If we can do it with a few thousand developers, I'm guessing your
project can as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-01-09 16:05:00 PST</strong>: This post is being discussed on
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/14/01/09/1940232/why-do-projects-continue-to-support-old-python-releases">Slashdot</a>. A lot of the comments
talk about Python 3. Python 3 is its own set of
considerations. The intended focus of this post is strictly about
dropping support for Python 2.6 and below. Python 3 is related
in that porting Python 2.x to Python 3 is much easier the higher
the Python 2.x version. This especially holds true when you want
to write Python that works simultaneously in both 2.x and 3.x.</p>
