  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When I first started writing web services, I was a huge RESTful fan
boy. The architectural properties - especially the parts related to
caching and scalability - really jived with me. But as I've grown
older and gained experienced, I've realized that RESTful design,
like many aspects of software engineering, is more of a guideline
or ideal than a panacea. This post is about one of those experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/2.5/webapi/">Review Board's Web API</a>
is RESTful. It's actually one of the better examples of a RESTful API
I've seen. There is a very clear separation between <em>resources</em>. And
everything - and I mean everything - is a resource. <em>Hyperlinks</em> are
used for the purposes described in Roy T. Fielding's dissertation.
I can tell the people who authored this web API understood RESTful
design and they succeeded in transferring that knowledge to a web API.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://reviewboard.mozilla.org">MozReview code review tool</a>
is built on top of Review Board. We've made a number of customizations.
The most significant is the ability to submit a series of commits
as one logical review series. This occurs as a side-effect of a
<em>hg push</em> to the code review repository. Once your changesets
are pushed to the remote repository, that server issues a number of
Review Board Web API HTTP requests to reviewboard.mozilla.org to
create the review requests, assign reviewers, etc. This is mostly all
built on the built-in web API endpoints offered by Review Board.</p>
<p>Because Review Board's Web API adheres to RESTful design principles
so well, turning a series of commits into a series of review requests
takes a lot of HTTP requests. For each commit, we have to perform
something like 5 HTTP requests to define the server state. For
series of say 10 commits (which aren't uncommon since we try to
encourage the use of microcommits), this can add up to dozens of
HTTP requests! And that's just counting the HTTP requests to
Review Board: because we've integrated Review Board with Bugzilla,
events like publishing result in additional RESTful HTTP requests from
Review Board to bugzilla.mozilla.org.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, submitting and publishing a series of 10
commits consumes somewhere between 75 and 100 HTTP requests! While
the servers are all in close physical proximity (read: low network
latencies), we are reusing TCP connections, and each HTTP request
completes fairly quickly, the overhead adds up. <strong>It's not uncommon
for publishing commit series to take over 30s.</strong> This is unacceptable
to developers. We want them to publish commits for review as quickly
as possible so they can get on with their next task. Humans should not
have to wait on machines.</p>
<p>Over in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229468">bug 1220468</a>,
I implemented a new batch submit web API for Review Board and converted
the Mercurial server to call it instead of the classic, RESTful Review
Board web APIs. <strong>In other words, I threw away the RESTful properties
of the web API and implemented a monolith API doing exactly what we
need.</strong> The result is a drastic reduction in net HTTP requests. In our
tests, submitting a series of 20 commits for review reduced the HTTP
request count by 104! Furthermore, the new API endpoint performs
all modifications in a single database transaction. Before, each HTTP
request was independent and we had bugs where failures in the middle of
a HTTP request series left the server in inconsistent and unexpected
state. The new API is significantly faster and more atomic as a bonus.
The main reason the new implementation isn't yet nearly instantaneous
is because we're still performing several RESTful HTTP requests to
Bugzilla from Review Board. But there are plans for Bugzilla to
implement the batch APIs we need as well, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>(I don't want to blame the Review Board or Bugzilla maintainers for
their RESTful web APIs that are giving MozReview a bit of scaling pain.
MozReview is definitely abusing them almost certainly in ways that
weren't imagined when they were conceived. To their credit, the
maintainers of both products have recognized the limitations in their
APIs and are working to address them.)</p>
<p>As much as I still love the properties of RESTful design, there are
practical limitations and consequences such as what I described
above. The older and more experienced I get, the less patience I have
for tolerating architecturally pure implementations that sacrifice
important properties, such as ease of use and performance.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many of the properties of RESTful design are
applicable to <em>microservices</em> as well. When you create a new service
in a microservices architecture, you are creating more overhead for
clients that need to speak to multiple services, making changes less
transactional and atomic, and making it difficult to consolidate
multiple related requests into a higher-level, simpler, and performant
API. I recommend
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html">Microservice Trade-Offs</a>
for more on this subject.</p>
<p>There is a place in the world for RESTful and microservice
architectures. And as someone who does a lot of server-side engineering,
I sympathize with wanting scalable, fault-tolerant architectures. But
like most complex problems, you need to be cognizant of trade-offs. It is
also important to not get too caught up with architectural purity if
it is getting in the way of delivering a simple, intuitive, and fast
product for your users. So, please, follow me down from the ivory tower.
The air was cleaner up there - but that was only because it was so
distant from the swamp at the base of the tower that surrounds every
software project.</p>
