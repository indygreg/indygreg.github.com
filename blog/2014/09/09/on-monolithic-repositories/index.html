  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When companies or organizations deploy version control, they have to
make many choices. One of them is how many repositories to create.
Your choices are essentially a) a single, monolithic repository that
holds everything b) many separate, smaller repositories that hold
all the individual parts c) something in between.</p>
<p>The prevailing convention today (especially in the open source
realm) is to create many separate and loosely coupled repositories,
each repository mapping to a specific product or service. That does
seem reasonable: if you were organizing files on your filesystem,
you would group them by functionality or role (photos, music,
documents, etc). And, version control tools are functionally
filesystems. So it makes sense to draw repository boundaries at
directory/role levels.</p>
<p>Further reinforcing the separate repository convention is the
scaling behavior of our version control tools. Git, the popular
tool in open source these days, doesn't scale well to very large
repositories due to - among other things - not having narrow clones
(fetching a subset of files). It scales well enough to the
overwhelming majority of projects. But if you are a large
organization generating lots of data (read: gigabytes of data over
hundreds of thousands of files and commits) for version control,
Git is unsuitable in its current form. Other tools (like Mercurial)
don't currently fare that much better (although Mercurial has plans
to tackle these scaling vectors).</p>
<p>Despite popular convention and even limitations in tools, companies
like Google and Facebook opt to run large, monolithic repositories.
Google runs Perforce.
<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/">Facebook is on Mercurial</a>,
or at least is in the process of migrating to Mercurial.</p>
<p>Why do these companies run monolithic repositories?
In <a href="http://www.perforce.com/sites/default/files/still-all-one-server-perforce-scale-google-wp.pdf">Google's words</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have a single large depot with almost all of Google's projects
on it. This aids agile development and is much loved by our users,
since it allows almost anyone to easily view almost any code, allows
projects to share code, and allows engineers to move freely from
project to project. Documentation and data is stored on the server
as well as code.</em></p>
<p>So, monolithic repositories are all about moving fast and getting things
done more efficiently. In other words, <strong>monolithic repositories
increase developer productivity.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, monolithic repositories are also more compatible with
the ebb and flow of large organizations and large software projects.
Components, features, products, and teams come and go, merge and split.
The only constant is change. And if you are maintaining separate
repositories that attempt to map to this ever-changing organizational
topology, you are going to have a bad time. Either you'll be
constantly copying, moving, merging, splitting, etc data and repositories.
Or your repositories will be organized in a very non-logical and
non-intuitive manner. That translates to overhead and lost productivity.
I think that monolithic repositories handle the realities of large
organizations much better. Big change or reorganization you want
to reflect? You can make a single, atomic, history-preserving commit
to move things around. I think that's much more manageable, especially
when you consider the difficulty and annoyance of history-preserving
changes across repositories.</p>
<p>Naysayers will decry monolithic repositories on principled and practical
grounds.</p>
<p>The principled camp will say that separate repositories
constitute a loosely coupled (dare I say service oriented) architecture
that maps better to how software is consumed, assembled, and deployed
and that erecting barriers in the form of separate repositories
deliberately enforces this architecture. I agree. However, you can
still maintain a loosely coupled architecture with monolithic
repositories. The Subversion model of checking out a single tree
<em>from a larger repository</em> proves this. Furthermore, I would say
architecture decisions should be enforced by people (via code review,
etc), not via version control repository topology. I believe this
principled argument against monolithic repositories to be rather weak.</p>
<p>The principled camp living in the open source realm may also decry
monolithic repositories as an affront to the spirit of open source.
They would say that a monolithic repository creates unfairly strong
ties to the organization that operates it and creates barriers to
forking, etc. This may be true. But monolithic repositories don't
intrinsically infringe on the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">basic software freedoms</a>,
organizations do. Therefore, I find this principled argument rather
weak.</p>
<p>The practical camp will say that monolithic repositories just don't
scale or aren't suitable for general audiences. These concerns are
real.</p>
<p><em>Fully</em> distributed version control systems (every commit on every
machine) definitely don't scale past certain limits. Depending on your
repository and user base, your scaling limits include disk space
(repository data terabytes in size), bandwidth (repository data terabytes
in size), filesystem (repository hundreds of thousands or millions of
files), CPU and memory (operations on large repositories take too
many system resources), and many heads/branches (tools like Git and
Mercurial don't scale well to tens of thousands of heads/branches).
These limitations with fully distributed version
control are why distributed version control tools like Git and
Mercurial support a partially-distributed mode that behaves more like
your classical server-client model, like those employed by Subversion,
Perforce, etc. Git supports shallow clone and sparse checkout.
Mercurial supports shallow clone (via remotefilelog) and has planned
support for narrow clone and sparse checkout by the end of 2015.
Of course, you can avoid the scaling limitations of distributed
version control by employing a non-distributed tool, such as Subversion.
Many companies continue to reach this conclusion today. However,
users adapted to the distributed workflow would likely be
up in arms (they would probably use tools like hg-subversion or git-svn
to maintain their workflows). So, while scaling of version control
can be a real concern, there are solutions and workarounds. However,
they do involve falling back to a partially-distributed model.</p>
<p>Another concern with monolithic repositories is user access control. You
inevitably have code or data that is more sensitive and want to limit
who can change or even access it. Separate repositories seem to
facilitate a simpler model: per-repository access control. With
monolithic repositories, you have to worry about per-directory/subtree
permissions, an increased risk of data leaking, etc. This concern is
more real with distributed version control, as distributed data and
access control aren't naturally compatible. But these issues can be
resolved. And if the tooling supports it, there is only a semantic
difference between managing access control between repositories versus
components of a single repository.</p>
<p>When it comes to repository hosting conversions, I agree with Google
and Facebook: <strong>I prefer monolithic repositories</strong>. When I am interacting
with version control, I just want to get stuff done. I don't want to
waste time dealing with multiple commands to manage multiple
repositories. I don't want to waste time or expend cognitive load
dealing with submodule, subrepository, or big files management. I
don't want to waste time trying to find and reuse code, data, or
documentation. I want everything at my fingertips, where it can be
easily discovered, inspected, and used. Monolithic repositories
facilitate these workflows more than separate repositories and make
me more productive as a result.</p>
<p>Now, if only all the tools and processes we use and love would work
with monolithic repositories...</p>
