  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>We had a hiccup on hg.mozilla.org yesterday. It resulted in prolonged
tree closures for Firefox.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094922">Bug 1094922</a>
tracks the issue.</p>
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>We noticed that many HTTP requests to hg.mozilla.org were getting 503
responses. On initial glance, the servers were healthy. CPU was below
100% utilization, I/O wait was reasonable. And there was little to no
swapping. Furthermore, the logs showed a healthy stream of requests
being successfully processed at levels that are typical. In other words,
it looked like business as usual on the servers.</p>
<p>Upon deeper investigation, we noticed that the WSGI process pool on the
servers was fully saturated. There were were 24 slots/processes per server
allocated to process Mercurial requests and all 24 of them were actively
processing requests. This created a backlog of requests that had been
accepted by the HTTP server but were waiting an internal dispatch/proxy
to WSGI. To the client, this would appear as a request with a long lag
before response generation.</p>
<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>This being an emergency (trees were already closed and developers were
effectively unable to use hg.mozilla.org), we decided to increase the
size of the WSGI worker pool. After all, we had CPU, I/O, and memory
capacity to spare and we could identify the root cause later. We first
bumped worker pool capacity from 24 to 36 and immediately saw a significant
reduction in the number of pending requests awaiting a WSGI worker. We
still had spare CPU, I/O, and memory capacity and were still seeing
requests waiting on a WSGI worker, so we bumped the capacity to 48
processes. At that time, we stopped seeing worker pool exhaustion and
all incoming requests were being handed off to a WSGI worker as soon as
they came in.</p>
<p>At this time, things were looking pretty healthy from the server end.</p>
<h2>Impact on Memory and Swapping</h2>
<p>Increasing the number of WSGI processes had the side-effect of
increasing the total amount of system memory used by Mercurial
processes in two ways. First, more processes means more memory. That
part is obvious. Second, more processes means fewer requests for each
process per unit of time and thus it takes longer for each process to
reach its max number of requests being being reaped. (It is a common
practice in servers to have a single process hand multiple requests.
This prevents overhead associated with spawning a new process and
loading possibly expensive context in it.)</p>
<p>We had our Mercurial WSGI processes configured to serve 100 requests
before being reaped. With the doubling of WSGI processes from 24 to 48,
those processes were lingering for 2x as long as before. Since the
Mercurial processes grow over time (they are aggressive about caching
repository data), this was slowly exhausting our memory pool.</p>
<p>It took a few hours, but a few servers started flirting with high swap
usage. (We don't expect the servers to swap.) This is how we identified
that memory use wasn't sane.</p>
<p>We lowered the maximum requests per process from 100 to 50 to match
the ratio increase in the WSGI worker pool.</p>
<h2>Mercurial Memory "Leak"</h2>
<p>When we started looking at the memory usage of WSGI processes in more
detail, we noticed something strange: RSS of Mercurial processes was
growing steadily when processes were streaming bundle data. This seemed
very odd to me. Being a Mercurial developer, I was pretty sure the
behavior was wrong.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4443">filed a bug</a> against
Mercurial.</p>
<p>I was able to reproduce the issue locally and started running a
bisection to find the regressing changeset. To my surprise, this issue
has been around since Mercurial 2.7!</p>
<p>I looked at the code in question, identified why so much memory was
being allocated, and submitted patches to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063518.html">stop an unbounded memory growth during clone/pull</a>
and to
<a href="http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2014-November/063520.html">further reduce memory use during those operations</a>.
Both of those patches have been queued to go in the next stable release
of Mercurial, 3.2.1.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.2 is still not as memory efficient during clones as Mercurial
2.5.4. If I have time, I'd like to formulate more patches. But the
important fix - not growing memory unbounded during clone/pull - is
in place.</p>
<p>Armed with the knowledge that Mercurial is leaky (although not a leak
in the traditional sense since the memory was eventually
getting garbage collected), we further reduced the max requests per
process from 50 to 20. This will cause processes to get reaped sooner
and will be more aggressive about keeping RSS growth in check.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>We suspect the root cause of the event is a network event.</p>
<p>Before this outage, we rarely had more than 10 requests being served
from the WSGI worker pool. In other words, we were often well below 50%
capacity. But something changed yesterday. More slots were being
occupied and high-bandwidth operations were taking longer to complete.
Kendall Libby noted that outbound traffic dropped by ~800 Mbps
during the event. For reasons that still haven't been identified, the
network became slower, clones weren't being processed as quickly, and
clients were occupying WSGI processes for longer amounts of time. This
eventually exhausted the available process pool, leading to HTTP 503's,
intermittent service availability, and a tree closure.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we noticed that in-flight HTTP requests are abnormally
high again this morning. However, because the servers are now configured
to handle the extra capacity, we seem to be powering through it without
any issues.</p>
<h2>In Hindsight</h2>
<p>You can make the argument that the servers weren't configured to serve
as much traffic as possible. After all, we were able to double the
WSGI process pool without hitting CPU, I/O, and memory limits.</p>
<p>The servers were conservatively configured. However, the worker pool
was initially configured at 2x CPU core count. And as a general rule of
thumb, you don't want your worker pool to be much greater than CPU
count because that introduces context switching and can give each
individual process a smaller slice of the CPU to process requests,
leading to higher latency. Since clone operations often manage to
peg a single CPU core, there is some justification for keeping the
ratio of WSGI workers to CPU count low. Furthermore, we rarely came
close to exhausting the WSGI worker pool before. There was little
to no justification for increasing capacity to a threshold not normally
seen.</p>
<p>But at the same time, even with 4x workers to CPU cores, our CPU
usage rarely flirts with 100% across all cores, even with the
majority of workers occupied. Until we actually hit CPU (or I/O)
limits, running a high multiplier seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Long term, we expect CPU usage during clone operations to drop
dramatically. Mike Hommey has contributed a patch to Mercurial that
allows servers to hand out a URL of a bundle file to fetch during
clone. So, a server can say <em>I have your data: fetch this static file
from S3 and then apply this small subset of the data that I'll give
you.</em> When properly deployed and used at Mozilla, this will effectively
drop server-side CPU usage for clones to nothing.</p>
<h2>Where to do Better</h2>
<p>There was a long delay between the Nagios alerts firing and someone
with domain-specific knowledge looking at the problem.</p>
<p>The trees could have reopened earlier. We were pretty confident about
the state of things at 1000. Trees opened in metered mode at 1246 and
completely at 1909. Although, the swapping issue wasn't mitigated until
1615, so you can argue that being conservative on the tree reopening
was justified. There is a chance that full reopening could have
triggered excessive swap and another round of chaos for everyone
involved.</p>
<p>We need an alert on WSGI pool exhaustion. It took longer than it should
have to identify this problem. However, now that we've encountered it,
it should be obvious if/when it happens again.</p>
<p>Firefox release automation is the largest single consumer of
hg.mozilla.org. Since they are operating thousands of machines, any
reduction in interaction or increase in efficiency will result in
drastic load reductions on the server. Chris AtLee and Jordan Lund
have been working on
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1050109">bug 1050109</a> to
reduce clones of the mozharness and build/tools repositories, which
should go a long way to dropping load on the server.</p>
