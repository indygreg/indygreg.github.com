  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As I've <a href="/blog/category/mercurial/">written before</a>, Mercurial is a
highly extensible version control system. You can do things with
Mercurial you can't do in other version control systems.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll outline some of the cool things Mozilla could do with
Mercurial. But first, I want to outline some features of Mercurial that
many don't know exist.</p>
<h2>pushkey and listkeys command</h2>
<p>The Mercurial wire protocol (how two Mercurial peer repositories
talk to each other over a network) contains two very useful commands:
<em>pushkey</em> and <em>listkeys</em>. These commands allow the storage and listing
of arbitrary key-value pair metadata in the repository.</p>
<p>This generic storage mechanism is how Mercurial stores and synchronizes
bookmarks and phases information, for example.</p>
<p>By implementing a Mercurial extension, you can have Mercurial store
key-value data for any arbitrary data namespace. You can then write
a simple extension that synchronizes this data as part of the push
and pull operations.</p>
<h2>Extending the wire protocol</h2>
<p>For cases where you want to transmit arbitrary data to/from Mercurial
servers and where the <em>pushkey</em> framework isn't robust enough, it's
possible to implement custom commands in the Mercurial wire protocol.</p>
<p>A server installs an extension making the commands available. A client
installs an extension knowing how to use the commands. Arbitrary data
is transferred or custom actions are performed.</p>
<p>When it comes to custom commands, the sky is really the limit. You
could do pretty much anything from transfer extra data types (this
is how the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LargefilesExtension">largefiles extension</a>
works) to writing commands that interact with remote agents.</p>
<h2>Custom revision set queries and templating</h2>
<p>Mercurial offers a rich framework for querying repository data and
for formatting data. The querying is called <em>revision sets</em> and the
later <em>templates</em>. If you are unfamiliar with the feature, I
encourage you to run <em>hg help revset</em> and <em>hg help templates</em> right
now to discover the awesomeness.</p>
<p>As I've <a href="/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/">demonstrated</a>,
you can do some very nifty things with custom revision sets and
templating!</p>
<h2>The possibilities</h2>
<p>Now that you know some ways Mercurial can be extended, let's talk about
some cool use cases at Mozilla. I want to be clear that I'm not
advocating we do these things, just that they are possible and maybe
they are a little cool.</p>
<h3>Storing pushlog data</h3>
<p>Mozilla records information about who pushed what changesets where and
when in what's called the <em>pushlog</em>. The pushlog data is currently
stored in a SQLite database inside the repository on the server. The
data is made available via a HTTP+JSON API.</p>
<p>We could go a step further and make the pushlog data available via
<em>listkeys</em> so Mercurial clients could download pushlog data with the
same channel used to pull core repository data. (Currently, we have
to open a new TCP connection and talk to the HTTP+JSON API.) This
would make fetching of pushlog data faster, especially for clients
on slow connections.</p>
<p>I concede this is an iterative improvement and adds little value beyond
what we currently have. But if I were designing pushlog storage from
scratch, this is how I'd do it.</p>
<h3>Storing a changeset's automation results</h3>
<p>The <em>pushkey</em> framework could be used to mark specific changesets
as passing automation. When release automation or a sheriff determines
that a changeset/push is green, they could issue an authenticated
<em>pushkey</em> command to the Mercurial server stating such. Clients
could then easily obtain a list of all changesets that are green.</p>
<p>Why stop there? We could also record automation failures in Mercurial as
well. Depending on how complex this gets, we may outgrow <em>pushkey</em>
and require a separate command. But that's all doable.</p>
<p>Anyway, clients could download automation results for a specific
changeset as part of the repository data. The same extension that
pulls down that data could also monkeypatch the bisection algorithm used
by <em>hg bisect</em> to automatically skip over changesets that didn't pass
automation. You'll never bisect a backed out changeset again!</p>
<p>If this automation data were stored on the Try repository, the autoland
tool would just need to query the Mercurial repo to see which changesets
are candidates for merging into mainline - there would be no need for
a separate database and web service!</p>
<h3>Marking a changeset as reviewed</h3>
<p>Currently, Mozilla's review procedure is very patch and Bugzilla
centric. But it doesn't have to be that way. (I argue it shouldn't be
that way.)</p>
<p>Imagine a world where code review is initiated by pushing changesets
to a special server, kind of like how Try magically turns pushes into
automation jobs.</p>
<p>In this world, reviews could be initiated by issuing a <em>pushkey</em>
or custom command to the server. This could even initiate
server-side static analysis that would hold off publishing the review
unless static analysis checks passed!</p>
<p>Granted review could be recorded by having someone issue a
<em>pushkey</em> command to mark a changeset as reviewed. The channel to the
Mercurial server is authenticated via SSH, so the user behind the
current SSH key is the reviewer. The Mercurial server could store this
username as part of the repository data. The autoland tool could then
pull down the reviewer data and only consider changesets that have an
appropriate reviewer.</p>
<p>It <em>might</em> also be possible to integrate crypto magic into this
workflow so reviewers could digitally sign a changeset as reviewed.
This could help with the verification of the Firefox source code
that Brendan Eich <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/01/trust-but-verify/">recently outlined</a>.</p>
<p>Like the automation data above, no separate
database would be required: all data would be part of the repository.
All you need to build is a Mercurial extension.</p>
<h3>Encouraging best practices</h3>
<p>Mozillians have written a handful of useful Mercurial extensions to
help people become more productive. We have also noticed that many
developers are still (unknowingly?) running old, slow, and buggy
Mercurial releases. We want people to have the best experience possible.
How do we do that?</p>
<p>One idea is to install an extension on the server that strongly
recommands or even requires users follow best practices (minimal HG
version, installed extensions, etc).</p>
<p>I have developed a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=941856">proof-of-concept</a>
that does just this.</p>
<h3>Rich querying of metadata</h3>
<p>When you start putting more metadata into Mercurial (or at least write
Mercurial extensions to aggregate this metadata), all kinds of
interesting query opportunities open up. Using revsets and templates,
you can do an awful lot to use Mercurial as a database of sorts
to extract useful reports.</p>
<p>I dare say reports like
<a href="http://oduinn.com/blog/2013/12/03/infrastructure-load-for-november-2013/">John O'duinn's Monthly Infrastructure Load</a>
posts could be completely derived from Mercurial. I've
<a href="/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/">demonstrated</a>
this ability previously. That's only the tip of the iceburg.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We could enable a lot of new and useful scenarios by extending
Mercurial. We could accomplish this without introducing new
services and tools into our already complicated infrastructure
and workflows.</p>
<p>The possibilities I've suggested are by no means exhaustive. I encourage
others to dream up new and interesting ideas. Who knows, maybe some of
them may actually happen.</p>
