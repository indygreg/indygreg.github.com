  <p>Version control services and interaction with them play an important
role at any company. Despite version control being a critical part
of your infrastructure, my experience from working at a few companies
and talking with others is that version control often doesn't get the
testing love that other services do. Hooks get written, spot-tested
by the author, and deployed. Tools that interact with version control
often rely on behavior that may or may not change over time,
especially when the version of your version control software is
upgraded.</p>
<p>We've seen this pattern at Mozilla. Mercurial hooks and extensions
were written and deployed to the server without test coverage. As a
result, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1070637">things break</a>
when we try to upgrade the server. This happens a few times and you
naturally develop an attitude of fear, uncertainty, and doubt around
touching anything on the server (or the clients for that matter). <em>If
it isn't broken, why fix it</em> prevails for months or years. Then one an
enthusiastic individual comes around wanting to deploy some hot new
functionality. You tell them the path is arduous because the server is
running antiquated versions of software and nothing is tested. The
individual realizes the amazing change isn't worth the effort and
justifiably throws up their hands and gives up. This is almost a
textbook definition of how not having test coverage can result
in technical debt. This is the position Mozilla is trying to recover
from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts I've had since joining the Developer Services
Team at Mozilla a little over a month ago has been changing the story
about how we test version control at Mozilla.</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that Mozilla now has a robust enough testing
infrastructure in place around our Mercurial server that we're feeling
pretty good about silencing the doubters when it comes to changing
server behavior. Here's how we did it.</p>
<p>The genesis of this project was likely me getting involved with the
hg-git and Mercurial projects. For hg-git, I learned a bit about
Mercurial internals and how extensions work. When I looked at Mercurial
extensions and hooks used by Mozilla, I started to realize what parts
were good and what parts were bad. I realized what parts would likely
break after upgrades. When I started contributing patches to Mercurial
itself, I took notice of how Mercurial is tested. When I discovered
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests">T Tests</a>, I thought,
<em>wow, that's pretty cool: we should use them to test Mozilla's Mercurial
customizations!</em></p>
<p>After some frustrations with Mercurial extensions breaking after
Mercurial upgrades, I wanted to do something about it to prevent this from
happening again. I'm a
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">huge fan of unified repositories</a>.
So earlier this year, I reached out to the various parties who maintain
all the different components and convinced nearly everyone that
establishing a single repository for all the version control code was a
<a href="/blog/2014/02/05/new-repository-for-mozilla-version-control-tools/">good idea</a>.
The <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/">version-control-tools</a>
repository was born. Things were slow at first. It was initially pretty
much my playground for hosting Mercurial extensions that I authored.
Fast forward a few months, and the version-control-tools repository now
contains full history imports of our
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hghooks">Mercurial hooks</a>
that are deployed on <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>, the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgtemplates">templates</a>
used to render HTML on hg.mozilla.org, and pretty much every
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext">Mercurial extension</a>
authored by Mozillians, including
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/pushlog-legacy">pushlog</a>.
Having all the code in one repository has been very useful. It has
simplified server deployments: we now pull 1 repository instead of 3. If
there is a dependency between different components, we can do the update
atomically. These are all benefits of using a single repository instead
of N&gt;1.</p>
<p>While version-control-tools was still pretty much my personal
playground, I introduced a short script for running tests. It was pretty
basic: just find test files and invoke them with Mercurial's test
harness. It served my needs pretty well. Over time, as more and more
functionality was rolled into version-control-tools, we expanded the
scope of the test harness.</p>
<p>We can now run Python unit tests (in addition to Mercurial .t tests).
Test all of the things!</p>
<p>We set up <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/">continuous integration</a>
with Jenkins so tests run after check-in and alert us when things fail.</p>
<p>We added <a href="https://ci.mozilla.org/job/version-control-tools/coveragepy/?">code coverage</a>
so we can see what is and isn't being tested. Using code coverage data,
we've
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1075274">identified a server upgrade bug</a>
before it happens. We're also using the data to ensure that code is tested
as thoroughly as it needs to be. The code coverage data has been
invaluable at assessing the quality of our tests. I'm still shocked that
Firefox developers tolerate not having JavaScript code coverage when
developing Firefox features. (I'm not saying code coverage is perfect,
merely that it is a valuable tool in your arsenal.)</p>
<p>We added support for running tests against multiple versions of
Mercurial. We even test the bleeding edge of Mercurial so we know when
an upstream Mercurial change breaks our code. So, no more surprises on
Mercurial release day. I can tell you today that we have a handful of
extensions that are broken in Mercurial 3.2, due for release around
November 1. (Hopefully we'll fix them before release.)</p>
<p>We have Vagrant configurations so you can start a virtual machine that
runs the tests the same way Jenkins does.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the test harness is the ability to spin up Docker
containers as part of tests. Right now, this is limited to running
Bugzilla during tests. But I imagine the scope will only increase over
time.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I want to quickly explain how amazing Mercurial's
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WritingTests#Writing_a_shell_script_test">.t tests</a>
are. These are a flavor of tests used by Mercurial and the dominant form
of new tests added to the version-control-tools repository. These tests
are glorified shell scripts annotated with expected
command output and other metadata. It might be easier to explain by
showing. Take
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t">bzpost's tests</a>
as an example. The bzpost extension automatically posts commit URLs to
Bugzilla during push.
<a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2014/06/30/update-bugzilla-automatically-on-push/">Read more</a>
if you are interested. What I like so much about .t tests is that they
are actually testing the user experience. The test
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l69">actually runs hg push</a>
and verifies the output is exactly what is intended. Furthermore,
since we're running a Dockerized Bugzilla server during the test, we're
able to
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/573db71cdb79/hgext/bzpost/tests/test-post.t#l108">verify</a>
that the bzpost extension actually resulted in Bugzilla comments being
added to the appropriate bug(s). Contrast this with unit tests that only
test a subset of functionality. Or, contrast with writing a lot of
boilerplate and often hard-to-read code that invokes processes and uses
regular expressions, etc to compare output. I find .t tests are more
concise and they do a better job of testing user experience. More than
once I've written a .t test and thought <em>this user experience doesn't
feel right, I should change the behavior to be more user friendly</em>. This
happened because I was writing actual end-user commands as part of
writing tests and seeing the exact output the user would see. It is
much harder to attain this sense of understanding when writing unit
tests. I can name a few projects with poor command line interfaces that
could benefit from this approach... I'm not saying .t tests are perfect
or that they should replace other testing methodologies such as unit
tests. I just think they are very useful for accurately testing
higher-level functionality and for assessing user experience. I really
wish we had these tests for mach commands...</p>
<p>Anyway, with a proper testing harness in place for our version control code,
we've been pretty good about ensuring new code is properly tested. When
people submit new hooks or patches to existing hooks, we can push back and
refuse to grant review unless tests are included. When someone requests a
new deployment to the server, we can look at what changed, cross-reference
to test coverage, and assess the riskiness of the deployment. We're getting
to the point where we just trust our tests and server deployments are minor
events. Concerns over accidental regressions due to server changes are
waning. We can tell people <em>if you really care about this not breaking,
you need a test</em> and <em>if you add a test, we'll support it for you.</em>
People are often more than happy to write tests to ensure them peace of
mind, especially when that test's presence shifts maintenance
responsibility away from them. We're happy because we don't have many
surprises (and fire drills) at deployment time. It's a win-win!</p>
<p>So, what's next? Good question! We still have a number of large gaps in
our test coverage. Our code to synchronize repositories from the master
server to read-only slaves is likely the most critical omission. We also
don't yet have a good way of reproducing our server environment.
Ideally, we'd run the continuous integration in an environment that's
very similar to production. Same package versions and everything. This
would also allow us to simulate the actual hg.mozilla.org server
topology during tests. Currently, our tests are more unit-style than
integration-style. We rely on the consistent behavior of Mercurial and
other tools as sufficient proxies for test accuracy and we back those up
with running the tests on the staging server before production
deployment. But these aren't a substitute for an accurate reproduction
of the production servers, especially when it comes to things like the
replication tests. We'll get there some day. I also have plans to
improve Mercurial's test harness to better facilitate some of our
advanced use cases. I would absolutely love to make Mercurial's .t test
harness more consumable outside the context of Mercurial.
(<a href="https://bitbucket.org/brodie/cram">cram</a> is one such attempt at this.)
We also need to incorporate the Git server code into this repository.
Currently, I'm pretty sure everything Git at Mozilla is untested.
Challenge accepted!</p>
<p>In summary, our story for testing version control at Mozilla has gone
from a cobbled together mess to something cohesive and comprehensive.
This has given us confidence to move fast without breaking things. I think
the weeks of people time invested into improving the state of testing
was well spent and will pay enormous dividends going forward. Looking
back, the mountain of technical debt now looks like a mole hill. I feel
good knowing that I played a part in making this change.</p>
