  <p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a really nifty tool. It
vastly lowers the barrier to distributing and executing applications. It
forces people to think about building server side code as a collection
of discrete applications and services. When it was released, I instantly
realized its potential, including for uses it wasn't primary intended
for, such as applications in automated build and test environments.</p>
<p>Over the months, Docker's feature set has grown and many of its
shortcomings have been addressed. It's more usable than ever. Most of my
early complaints and concerns have been addressed or are actively being
addressed.</p>
<p>But one supposedly solved part of Docker still bothers me: image
creation.</p>
<p>One of the properties that gets people excited about Docker is the
ability to ship execution environments around as data. Simply produce an
image once, transfer it to a central server, pull it down from anywhere,
and execute. That's pretty damn elegant. I dare say Docker has solved
the image <em>distribution</em> problem. (Ignore for a minute that the
implementation detail of how images map to filesystems still has a few
quirks to work out. But they'll solve that.)</p>
<p>The ease at which Docker manages images is brilliant. I, like many, was
overcome with joy and marvelled at how amazing it was. But as I started
producing more and more images, my initial excitement turned to
frustration.</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me most about images is that the de facto and
recommended method for producing images is neither deterministic nor
results in minimal images. I strongly believe that the current
recommended and applied approach is far from optimal and has too many
drawbacks. Let me explain.</p>
<p>If you look at the Dockerfiles from the official
<a href="https://github.com/docker-library">Docker library</a>
(examples: <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/node/blob/51b1dd1984e287189106884c453ca506737eed78/0.11/Dockerfile">Node</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/master/5.7/Dockerfile">MySQL</a>),
you notice something in common: they tend to use <em>apt-get update</em> as one
of their first steps. For those not familiar with Apt, that command will
synchronize the package repository indexes with a remote server. In
other words, depending on when you run the command, different versions
of packages will be pulled down and the result of image creation will
differ. The same thing happens when you clone a Git repository. Depending
on when you run the command - when you create the image - you may get
different output. If you create an image from scratch today, it could have
a different version of say Python than it did the day before. This can be
a big deal, especially if you are trying to use Docker to accurately
reproduce environments.</p>
<p>This non-determinism of building Docker images really bothers me. It
seems to run counter to Docker's goal of facilitating reliable
environments for running applications. Sure, one person can
produce an image once, upload it to a Docker Registry server, and have
others pull it. But there are applications where independent production
of the same base image is important.</p>
<p>One area is the security arena. There are many people who are
justifiably paranoid about running binaries produced by others and
pre-built Docker images set off all kinds of alarms. So, these people
would rather build an image from source, from a Dockerfile, than pull
binaries. Except then they build the image from a Dockerfile and the
application doesn't run because of an incompatibility with a new
version of some random package whose version wasn't pinned. Of course,
you probably lost numerous hours tracing down this obscure reason. How
frustrating! Determinism and verifiability as part of Docker image
creation help solve this problem.</p>
<p>Deterministic image building is also important for disaster recovery.
What happens if your Docker Registry and all hosts with copies of its
images go down? If you go to build the images from scratch again, what
guarantee do you have that things will behave the same? Without
determinism, you are taking a risk that things will be different and
your images won't work as intended. That's scary. (Yes, Docker is no
different here from existing tools that attempt to solve this problem.)</p>
<p>What if your open source product relies on a proprietary component that
can't be legally distributed? So much for Docker image distribution. The
best you can do is provide a base image and instructions for completing
the process. But if that doesn't work deterministically, your users now
have varying Docker images, again undermining Docker's goal of
increasing consistency.</p>
<p>My other main concern about Docker images is that they tend to be large,
both in size and in scope. Many Docker images use a full Linux install
as their base. A lot of people start with a base e.g. Ubuntu or Debian
install, <em>apt-get install</em> the required packages, do some extra
configuration, and call it a day. Simple and straightforward, yes. But
this practice makes me more than a bit uneasy.</p>
<p>One of the themes surrounding Docker is minimalism. Containers are
lighter than VMs; just ship your containers around; deploy dozens or
hundreds of containers simultaneously; compose your applications of
many, smaller containers instead of larger, monolithic ones. I get it
and am totally on board. So why are Docker images built on top of the
bloaty excess of a full operating system (modulo the kernel)? Do I
really need a package manager in my Docker image? Do I need a compiler
or header files so I can e.g. build binary Python extensions? No, I
don't, thank you.</p>
<p>As a security-minded person, I want my Docker images to consist of only
the files they need, especially binary files. By leaving out
non-critical elements from your image and your run-time environment,
you are reducing the surface area to attack. If your application
doesn't need a shell, don't include a shell and don't leave yourself
potentially vulnerable to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29">shellshock</a>.
I want the attacker who inevitably breaks out of my application into the
outer container to get nothing, not something that looks like an operating
system and has access to tools like curl and wget that could potentially
be used to craft a more advanced attack (which might even be able to
exploit a kernel vulnerability to break out of the container). Of
course, you can and should pursue additional security protections in
addition to attack surface reduction to secure your execution
environment. Defense in depth. But that doesn't give Docker images a
free pass on being bloated.</p>
<p>Another reason I want smaller containers is... because they are smaller.
People tend to have relatively slow upload bandwidth. Pushing Docker
images that can be hundreds of megabytes clogs my tubes. However, I'll
gladly push 10, 20, or even 50 megabytes of only the necessary data.
When you factor in that Docker image creation isn't deterministic, you
also realize that different people are producing different versions of
images from the same Dockerfiles and that you have to spend extra
bandwidth transferring the different versions around. This bites me all
the time when I'm creating new images and am experimenting with the
creation steps. I tend to bypass the fake caching mechanism (fake
because the output isn't deterministic) and this really results in data
explosion.</p>
<p>I understand why Docker images are neither deterministic nor minimal:
making them so is a hard problem. I think Docker was right to prioritize
solving distribution (it opens up many new possibilities). But I really
wish some effort could be put into making images deterministic (and thus
verifiable) and more minimal. I think it would make Docker an even more
appealing platform, especially for the security conscious. (As an aside,
I would absolutely love if we could ship a
<a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/01/trust-but-verify/">verifiable Firefox</a>
build, for example.)</p>
<p>These are hard problems. But they are solvable. Here's how I would do
it.</p>
<p>First, let's tackle deterministic image creation. Despite computers and
software being ideally deterministic, building software tends not to be,
so deterministic image creation is a hard problem. Even
tools like Puppet and Chef which claim to solve aspects of this problem
don't do a very good job with determinism. Read my post on
<a href="/blog/2013/06/24/the-importance-of-time-on-automated-machine-configuration/">The Importance of Time on Machine Provisioning</a>
for more on the topic. But there are solutions. <a href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>
and the <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a> package manager have the potential
to be used as the basis of a deterministic image building platform.
The <a href="http://nixos.org/nix/about.html">high-level overview of Nix</a> is
that the inputs and contents of a package determine the package ID. If
you know how Git or Mercurial get their commit SHA-1's, it's pretty much
the same concept. In theory, two people on different machines start with
the same environment and bootstrap the exact same packages, all from
source. <a href="https://gitian.org/">Gitian</a> is a similar solution. Although I
prefer Nix's content-based approach and how it goes about managing
packages and environments. Nix feels so right as a base for
deterministically building software. Anyway, yes, fully verifiable
build environments are turtles all the way down (I recommend reading
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details">Tor's overview of the problem and their approach</a>.
However, Nix's approach addresses many of the turtles and silences most
of the critics. I would absolutely love if more and more Docker images
were the result of a deterministic build process like Nix. Perhaps you
could define the full set of packages (with versions) that would be
used. Let's call this the package manifest. You would then PGP sign and
distribute your manifest. You could then have Nix step through all the
dependencies, compiling everything from source. If PGP verification
fails, compilation output changes, or extra files are needed, the build
aborts or issues a warning. I have a feeling the security-minded
community would go crazy over this. I know I would.</p>
<p>OK, so now you can use Nix to produce packages (and thus images)
(more) deterministically. How do you make them minimal? Well, instead of
just packaging the entire environment, I'd employ tools like
<a href="http://www.floc.net/makejail/">makejail</a>. The purpose of makejail is to
create minimal chroot <em>jail</em> environments. These are very similar to
Docker/LXC containers. In fact, you can often take a tarball of a chroot
directory tree and convert it into a Docker container! With makejail,
you define a configuration file saying among other things what binaries
to run inside the jail. makejail will trace file I/O of that binary and
copy over accessed files. The result is an execution environment that
(hopefully) contains only what you need. Then, create an archive of that
environment and pipe it into <em>docker build</em> to create a minimal Docker
image.</p>
<p>In summary, Nix provides you with a reliable and verifiable build
environment. Tools like makejail pair down the produced packages into
something minimal, which you then turn into your Docker image. Regular
people can still pull binary images, but they are much smaller and more
in tune with Docker's principles of minimalism. The paranoid among us can
produce the same bits from source (after verifying the inputs look
credible and waiting through a few hours of compiling). Or, perhaps
the individual files in the image could be signed and thus verified via
trust somehow? The company deploying Docker can have peace of mind
that disaster scenarios resulting in Docker image loss should not
result in total loss of the image (just rebuild it exactly as it was
before).</p>
<p>You'll note that my proposed solution does not involve Dockerfiles as
they exist today. I just don't think Dockerfile's design of stackable
layers of commands is the right model, at least for people who care
about determinism and minimalism. You really want a recipe that
knows how to create a set of relevant files and some metadata like what
ports to expose, what command to run on container start, etc and turn
that into your Docker image. I suppose you could accomplish this all
inside Dockerfiles. But that's a pretty radical departure from how
Dockerfiles work today. I'm not sure the two solutions are compatible.
Something to think about.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure of what it would take to add deterministic and verifiable
building of minimal and more secure Docker images. And, if someone
solved this problem, it could be applicable outside of Docker (again,
Docker images are essentially chroot environments plus metadata).
As I was putting the finishing touches on this article, I discovered
<a href="http://zef.me/6049/nix-docker/">nix-docker</a>. It looks very promising!
I hope the Docker community latches on to these ideas and makes
deterministic, verifiable, and minimal images the default, not the
exception.</p>
