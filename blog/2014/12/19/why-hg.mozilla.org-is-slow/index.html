  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>At Mozilla, I often hear statements like <em>Mercurial is slow.</em> That's a
very general statement. Depending on the context, it can mean one or
more of several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Mercurial workflow is not very efficient</li>
<li><em>hg</em> commands I execute are slow to run</li>
<li><em>hg</em> commands I execute appear to stall</li>
<li>The Mercurial server I'm interfacing with is slow</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to spend time talking about a specific problem: why
hg.mozilla.org (the server) is slow.</p>
<h2>What Isn't Slow</h2>
<p><strong>If you are talking to hg.mozilla.org over HTTP or HTTPS
(https://hg.mozilla.org/), there should not currently be any server
performance issues</strong>. Our Mercurial HTTP servers are pretty beefy and
are able to absorb a lot of load.</p>
<p>If https://hg.mozilla.org/ is slow, chances are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are doing something like cloning a 1+ GB repository.</li>
<li>You are asking the server to do something really expensive (like
  generate JSON for 100,000 changesets via the pushlog query interface).</li>
<li>You don't have a high bandwidth connection to the server.</li>
<li>There is a network event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Previous Network Events</h2>
<p>There have historically been network capacity issues in the datacenter
where hg.mozilla.org is hosted (SCL3).</p>
<p>During Mozlandia, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1107156">excessive traffic to ftp.mozilla.org</a>
essentially saturated the SCL3 network. During this time, requests to
hg.mozilla.org were timing out: Mercurial traffic just couldn't traverse
the network. Fortunately, events like this are quite rare.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Firefox release automation was effectively
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096337">overwhelming the network</a>
by doing some clownshoesy things.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096653">gaia-central was being cloned all the time</a>
We had a ~1.6 GB repository being cloned over a thousand times per day. We
were transferring close to 2 TB of gaia-central data out of Mercurial servers
per day</p>
<p>We also found issues with
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1096650">pushlogs sending 100+ MB responses</a>.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1100574">build/tools repo was getting cloned for every job</a>. Ditto for mozharness.</p>
<p>In all, <strong>we identified a few terabytes of excessive Mercurial traffic
that didn't need to exist</strong>. This excessive traffic was saturating the
SCL3 network and slowing down not only Mercurial traffic, but other
traffic in SCL3 as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, people from Release Engineering were quick to respond to
and fix the problems once they were identified. The problem is now
firmly in control. Although, given the scale of Firefox's release
automation, any new system that comes online that talks to version
control is susceptible to causing server outages. I've already raised
this concern when reviewing some TaskCluster code. The thundering herd
of automation will be an ongoing concern. But I have plans to further
mitigate risk in 2015. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Looking back at our historical data, it appears that we hit these
network saturation limits a few times before we reached a tipping point
in early November 2014. Unfortunately, we didn't realize this because up
until recently, we didn't have a good source of data coming from the
servers. We lacked the tooling to analyze what we had. We lacked the
experience to know what to look for. Outages are effective flashlights.
We learned a lot and know what we need to do with the data moving
forward.</p>
<h2>Available Network Bandwidth</h2>
<p>One person pinged me on IRC with the comment <em>Git is cloning much faster
than Mercurial.</em> I asked for timings and the Mercurial clone wall time
for Firefox was much higher than I expected.</p>
<p>The reason was network bandwidth. This person was performing a Git clone
between 2 hosts in EC2 but was performing the Mercurial clone between
hg.mozilla.org and a host in EC2. In other words, they were partially
comparing the performance of a 1 Gbps network against a link over the
public internet! When they did a fair comparison by removing the network
connection as a variable, the clone times rebounded to what I expected.</p>
<p>The single-homed nature of hg.mozilla.org in a single datacenter in
northern California is not only bad for disaster recovery reasons, it
also means that machines far away from SCL3 or connecting to SCL3 over a
slow network aren't getting optimal performance.</p>
<p>In 2015, expect us to build out a geo-distributed hg.mozilla.org so that
connections are hitting a server that is closer and thus faster. This
will probably be targeted at Firefox release automation in AWS first. We
want those machines to have a fast connection to the server <strong>and</strong> we
want their traffic isolated from the servers developers use so that
hiccups in automation don't impact the ability for humans to access
and interface with source code.</p>
<h2>NFS on SSH Master Server</h2>
<p>If you connect to http://hg.mozilla.org/ or https://hg.mozilla.org/, you
are hitting a pool of servers behind a load balancer. These servers have
repository data stored on local disk, where I/O is fast. In reality,
most I/O is serviced by the page cache, so local disks don't come into
play.</p>
<p>If you connect to ssh://hg.mozilla.org/, you are hitting a single,
master server. Its repository data is hosted on an NFS mount. I/O on the
NFS mount is horribly slow. Any I/O intensive operation performed on the
master is much, much slower than it should be. Such is the nature of
NFS.</p>
<p>We'll be exploring ways to mitigate this performance issue in 2015. But
it isn't the biggest source of performance pain, so don't expect anything
immediately.</p>
<h2>Synchronous Replication During Pushes</h2>
<p>When you <em>hg push</em> to hg.mozilla.org, the changes are first made on the
SSH/NFS master server. They are subsequently mirrored out to the HTTP
read-only slaves.</p>
<p>As is currently implemented, the mirroring process is performed
synchronously during the push operation. The server waits for the
mirrors to complete (to a reasonable state) before it tells the client
the push has completed.</p>
<p>Depending on the repository, the size of the push, and server and
network load, <strong>mirroring commonly adds 1 to 7 seconds to push times</strong>.
This is time when a developer is sitting at a terminal, waiting for <em>hg
push</em> to complete. The time for Try pushes can be larger: 10 to 20
seconds is not uncommon (but fortunately not the norm).</p>
<p>The current mirroring mechanism is overly simple and prone to many
failures and sub-optimal behavior. I plan to work on fixing mirroring in
2015. When I'm done, there should be no user-visible mirroring delay.</p>
<h2>Pushlog Replication Inefficiency</h2>
<p>Up until yesterday (when we
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112415">deployed a rewritten pushlog extension</a>,
the replication of pushlog data from master to server was very
inefficient. Instead of tranferring a delta of pushes since last pull,
we were literally copying the underlying SQLite file across the network!</p>
<p>Try's pushlog is ~30 MB. mozilla-central and mozilla-inbound are in the
same ballpark. 30 MB x 10 slaves is a lot of data to transfer. These
operations were capable of periodically saturating the network, slowing
everyone down.</p>
<p>The rewritten pushlog extension performs a delta transfer automatically
as part of <em>hg pull</em>. Pushlog synchronization now completes in
milliseconds while commonly only consuming a few kilobytes of network
traffic.</p>
<p>Early indications reveal that deploying this change yesterday decreased the
push times to repositories with long push history by 1-3s.</p>
<h2>Try</h2>
<p>Pretty much any interaction with the
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try">Try repository</a> is guaranteed to have poor
performance. The Try repository is doing things that distributed
versions control systems weren't designed to do. This includes Git.</p>
<p>If you are using Try, all bets are off. Performance will be problematic
until we roll out the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1055298">headless try</a>
repository.</p>
<p>That being said, we've made changes recently to make Try perform better.
<a href="https://twitter.com/lxt/status/546042588822642688">The median time for pushing to Try</a>
has decreased significantly in the past few weeks. The first dip in
mid-November was due to upgrading the server from Mercurial 2.5 to
Mercurial 3.1 and from converting Try to use <em>generaldelta</em> encoding.
The dip this week has been from merging all heads and from deploying the
aforementioned pushlog changes. <strong>Pushing to Try is now significantly
faster than 3 months ago.</strong></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many of the reasons for hg.mozilla.org slowness are known. More often
than not, they are due to clownshoes or inefficiencies on Mozilla's
part rather than fundamental issues with Mercurial.</p>
<p><strong>We have made significant progress at making hg.mozilla.org faster.</strong>
But we are not done. We are continuing to invest in fixing the
sub-optimal parts and making hg.mozilla.org faster yet. I'm confident
that within a few months, nobody will be able to say that the servers
are a source of pain like they have been for years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mercurial is investing in features to make the wire
protocol faster, more efficient, and more powerful. When deployed,
these should make pushes faster on <em>any</em> server. They will also enable
workflow enhancements, such as Facebook's experimental extension to
perform rebases as part of push (eliminating push races and having to
manually rebase when you lose the push race).</p>
