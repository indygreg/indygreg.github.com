  <p>When Docker was taking off like wildfire in 2013, I was caught up in the
excitement like everyone else. I remember knowing of the existence
of LXC and container technologies in Linux at the time. But Docker seemed to
be the first open source tool to actually make that technology usable (a
terrific example of how user experience matters).</p>
<p>At Mozilla, Docker was adopted all around me and by me for various utilities.
<a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/">Taskcluster</a> - Mozilla's task execution
framework geared for running complex CI systems - adopted Docker as a
mechanism to run processes in self-contained images. Various groups in
Mozilla adopted Docker for running services in production. I adopted Docker
for
<a href="/blog/2015/01/24/end-to-end-testing-with-docker/">integration testing of complex systems</a>.</p>
<p>Having seen various groups use Docker and having spent a lot of time in the
trenches battling technical problems, my conclusion is <strong>Docker is unsuitable
as a general purpose container runtime. Instead, Docker has its niche
for hosting complex network services.</strong> Other uses of Docker should highly
scrutinized and potentially discouraged.</p>
<p>When Docker hit first the market, it was arguably the only game in town.
Using Docker to achieve containerization was defensible because there weren't
exactly many (any?) practical alternatives. So if you wanted to use containers,
you used Docker.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. We now have the
<a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a> (OCI). There are
specifications describing common container formats. So you can produce a
container once and take it to any number OCI compatible <em>container runtimes</em>
for execution. And in 2018, there are a <em>ton</em> of players in this space.
<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rkt/rkt">rkt</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a> are just some. So Docker is no
longer the only viable tool for executing a container. If you are just
getting started with the container space, you would be wise to research the
available options and their pros and cons.</p>
<p>When you look at all the options for running containers in 2018, I think it
is obvious that Docker - usable though it may be - is not ideal for a
significant number of container use cases. If you divide use cases into a spectrum
where one end is <em>run a process in a sandbox</em> and the other is <em>run a complex system
of orchestrated services in production</em>, Docker appears to be focusing on the
latter. Take it from <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker themselves</a>:</p>
<p><em>Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container
platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today's
businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by
existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly
diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker
enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers
and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better
collaboration and innovation.</em></p>
<p>That description of Docker (the company) does a pretty good job of
describing what Docker (the technology) has become: a constellation
of software components providing the underbelly for managing complex
applications in complex infrastructures. That's pretty far detached on the
spectrum from <em>run a process in a sandbox</em>.</p>
<p>Just because Docker (the company) is focused on a complex space doesn't mean
they are incapable of exceeding at solving simple problems. However, I believe
that in this particular case, the complexity of what Docker (the company) is
focusing on has inhibited its Docker products to adequately address simple
problems.</p>
<p>Let's dive into some technical specifics.</p>
<p>At its most primitive, Docker is a glorified tool to run a process in a
sandbox. On Linux, this is accomplished by using
the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> function
with specific flags and combined with various other techniques (filesystem
remounting, capabilities, cgroups, chroot, seccomp, etc) to <em>sandbox</em> the
process from the main operating system environment and kernel. There are a host
of tools living at this not-quite-containers level that make it easy to run
a sandboxed process. The
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap">bubblewrap</a> tool is one of them.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you don't need anything fancy to create a process
sandbox: just an executable you want to invoke and an executable that makes
a set of system calls (like bubblewrap) to run that executable.</p>
<p>When you install Docker on a machine, it starts a daemon running as root.
That daemon listens for HTTP requests on a network port and/or UNIX socket.
When you run <code>docker run</code> from the command line, that command establishes
a connection to the Docker daemon and sends any number of HTTP requests to
instruct the daemon to take actions.</p>
<p>A daemon with a remote control protocol is useful. But it shouldn't be the
only way to spawn containers with Docker. If all I want to do is spawn a temporary
container that is destroyed afterwards, I should be able to do that from
a local command without touching a network service. Something like bubblewrap.
The daemon adds all kinds of complexity and overhead. Especially if I just want
to run a simple, short-lived command.</p>
<p>Docker at this point is already pretty far detached from a tool like bubblewrap.
And the disparity gets worse.</p>
<p>Docker adds another abstraction on top of basic process sandboxing in the form
of storage / filesystem management. Docker insists that processes execute in
self-contained, chroot()'d filesystem environment and that these environments
(Docker images) be managed by Docker itself. When Docker images are <em>imported</em>
into Docker, Docker manages them using one of a handful of
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/">storage drivers</a>. You can choose
from devicemapper, overlayfs, zfs, btrfs, and aufs and employ various
configurations of all these. Docker images are composed of <em>layers</em>, with one
layer stacked on top of the prior. This allows you to have an immutable base
layer (that can be shared across containers) where run-time file changes can be
isolated to a specific container instance.</p>
<p>Docker's ability to manage storage is pretty cool. And I dare say Docker's killer
feature in the very beginning of Docker was the ability to easily produce and
exchange self-contained Docker <em>images</em> across machines.</p>
<p>But this utility comes at a <em>very</em> steep price. Again, if our use case is
<em>run a process in a sandbox</em>, do we really care about all this advanced
storage functionality? Yes, if you are running hundreds of containers on
a single system, a storage model built on top of copy-on-write is perhaps
necessary for scaling. But for simple cases where you just want to run a single
or small number of processes, it is extremely overkill and adds many more
problems than it solves.</p>
<p>I cannot stress this enough, but <strong>I have spent hours debugging and working
around problems due to how filesystems/storage works in Docker</strong>.</p>
<p>When Docker was initially released, aufs was widely used. As I
<a href="/blog/2017/12/08/good-riddance-to-aufs/">previously wrote</a>, aufs has abysmal
performance as you scale up the number of concurrent I/O operations. We shaved
<strong>minutes</strong> off tasks in Firefox CI by ditching aufs for overlayfs.</p>
<p>But overlayfs is far from a panacea. File metadata-only updates are
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/rev/63f19cfacc5c">apparently very slow in overlayfs</a>.
We're talking ~100ms to call <code>fchownat()</code> or <code>utimensat()</code>. If you perform
an <code>rsync -a</code> or <code>chown -R</code> on a directory with only just a hundred files that
were defined in a base image layer, you can have delays of seconds.</p>
<p>The Docker storage drivers backed by <em>real</em> filesystems like zfs and btrfs are
a bit better. But they have their quirks too. For example, creating layers in
images is comparatively very slow compared to overlayfs (which are practically
instantaneous). This matters when you are iterating on a Dockerfile for example
and want to quickly test changes. Your edit-compile cycle grows frustratingly
long very quickly.</p>
<p>And I could opine on a handful of other problems I've encountered over the years.</p>
<p>Having spent hours of my life debugging and working around issues with
Docker's storage, my current attitude is <em>enough of this complexity, just let me
use a directory backed by the local filesystem, dammit</em>.</p>
<p>For many use cases, <strong>you don't need the storage complexity that Docker forces
upon you</strong>. Pointing Docker at a directory on a local filesystem to chroot into
is <em>good enough</em>. I know the behavior and performance properties of common Linux
filesystems. ext4 isn't going to start making <code>fchownat()</code> or <code>utimensat()</code> calls
take ~100ms. It isn't going to complain when a hard link spans multiple layers in
an image. Or slow down to a crawl when multiple threads are performing concurrent
read I/O. There's not going to be intrinsically complicated algorithms and
caching to walk N image layers to find the most recent version of a file (or if
there is, it will be so far down the stack in kernel land that I likely won't
ever have to deal with it as a normal user). Docker images with their multiple
layers add complexity and overhead. For many use uses, the pain it inflicts
offsets the initial convenience it saves.</p>
<p>Docker's optimized-for-complex-use-cases architecture demonstrates its
inefficiency in simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>On my machine, <code>docker run -i --rm debian:stretch /bin/ls /</code> takes ~850ms.
Almost a second to perform a directory listing (sometimes it does take over
1 second - I was being generous and quoting a quicker time). This command
takes ~1ms when run in a local shell. So we're at 2.5-3 magnitudes of overhead.
The time here does include time to initially create the container and
destroy it afterwards. We can isolate that overhead by starting a persistent
container and running <code>docker exec -i &lt;cid&gt; /bin/ls /</code> to spawn a new process
in an existing container. This takes ~85ms. So, ~2 magnitudes of overhead to
spawn a process in a Docker container versus spawning it <em>natively</em>. What's
adding so much overhead, I'm not sure. Yes, there are HTTP requests under
the hood. But HTTP to a local daemon shouldn't be that slow. I'm not sure
what's going on.</p>
<p>If we <code>docker export</code> that image to the local filesystem and use <code>runc state</code>
to configure so we can run it with <code>runc</code>, <code>runc run</code> takes ~85ms to run
<code>/bin/ls /</code>. If we <code>runc exec &lt;cid&gt; /bin/ls /</code> to start a process in an
existing container, that completes in ~10ms. <code>runc</code> appears to be executing
these simple tasks ~10x faster than Docker.</p>
<p>But to even get to that point, we had to make a filesystem available to
spawn the container in. With Docker, you need to load an image into Docker.
Using <code>docker save</code> to produce a 105,523,712 tar file,
<code>docker load -i image.tar</code> takes ~1200ms to complete. <code>tar xf image.tar</code>
takes ~65ms to extract that image to the local filesystem. Granted, Docker
is computing the SHA-256 of the image as part of import. But SHA-256 runs
at ~250MB/s on my machine and on that ~105MB input takes ~400ms. Where is
that extra ~750ms of overhead in Docker coming from?</p>
<p>The Docker image loading overhead is still present on large images. With
a 4,336,605,184 image, <code>docker load</code> was taking ~32s and <code>tar x</code> was
taking ~2s. Obviously the filesystem was buffering writes in the <code>tar</code>
case. And the ~2s is ignoring the ~17s to obtain the SHA-256 of the
entire input. But there's still a substantial disparity here. (I suspect
a lot of it is overlayfs not being as optimal as ext4.)</p>
<p>Several years ago there weren't many good choices for tools to execute containers.
But today, there are good tools readily available. And thanks to OCI standards,
you can often swap in alternate container runtimes. Docker (the tool) has an
architecture that is optimized for solving complex use cases (coincidentally use
cases that Docker the company makes money from). Because of this, my conclusion -
drawn from using Docker for several years - is that Docker is unsuitable for
many common use cases. <strong>If you care about low container startup/teardown
overhead, low latency when interacting with containers (including spawning
processes from outside of them), and for workloads where Docker's storage model
interferes with understanding or performance, I think Docker should be avoided.</strong>
A simpler tool (such as <code>runc</code> or even <code>bubblewrap</code>) should be used instead.</p>
<p>Call me a curmudgeon, but having seen all the problems that Docker's complexity
causes, I'd rather see my containers resemble a tarball that can easily be
chroot()'d into. <strong>I will likely be revisiting projects that use Docker and
replacing Docker with something lighter weight and architecturally simpler.</strong> As
for the use of Docker in the more complex environments it seems to be designed
for, I don't have a meaningful opinion as I've never really used it in that
capacity. But given my negative experiences with Docker over the years, I am
definitely biased against Docker and will lean towards simpler products, especially
if their storage/filesystem management model is simpler. Docker introduced
containers to the masses and they should be commended for that. But for my
day-to-day use cases for containers, Docker is simply not the right tool for
the job.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what I'll replace Docker with for my simpler use cases.
If you have experiences you'd like to share, sharing them in the comments
will be greatly appreciated.</p>
