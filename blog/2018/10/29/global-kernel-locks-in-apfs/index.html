  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Over the past several months, a handful of people had been complaining
that Mercurial's test harness was executing much slower on Macs. But
this slowdown seemingly wasn't occurring on Linux or Windows. And not
every Mac user experienced the slowness!</p>
<p>Before jetting off to the Mercurial 4.8 developer meetup in Stockholm
a few weeks ago, I sat down with a relatively fresh 6+6 core MacBook Pro
and experienced the problem firsthand: on my 4+4 core i7-6700K running
Linux, the Mercurial test harness completes in ~12 minutes, but on this
MacBook Pro, it was executing in ~38 minutes! On paper, this result
doesn't make any sense because there's no way that the MacBook Pro should
be ~3x slower than that desktop machine.</p>
<p>Looking at Activity Monitor when running the test harness with 12 tests
in parallel revealed something odd: the system was spending ~75% of overall
CPU time inside the kernel! When reducing the number of tests that ran in
parallel, the percentage of CPU time spent in the kernel decreased and
the overall test harness execution time also decreased. This kind of
behavior is usually a sign of something very inefficient in kernel land.</p>
<p>I sample profiled all processes on the system when running the Mercurial
test harness. Aggregate thread stacks revealed a common pattern:
<code>readdir()</code> being in the stack.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the stacks, <code>readdir()</code> calls into
<code>apfs_vnop_readdir()</code>, which calls into some functions with <code>bt</code> or
<code>btree</code> in their name, which call into <code>lck_mtx_lock()</code>,
<code>lck_mtx_lock_grab_mutex()</code> and various other functions with
<code>lck_mtx</code> in their name. And the caller of most <code>readdir()</code> appeared
to be Python 2.7's module importing mechanism (notably
<code>import.c:case_ok()</code>).</p>
<p>APFS refers to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">Apple File System</a>,
which is a filesystem that Apple introduced in 2017 and is the
default filesystem for new versions of macOS and iOS. If upgrading an
old Mac to a new macOS, its HFS+ filesystems would be automatically
converted to APFS.</p>
<p>While the source code for APFS is not available for me to confirm, the
profiling results showing excessive time spent in
<code>lck_mtx_lock_grab_mutex()</code> combined with the fact that execution time
decreases when the parallel process count decreases leads me to the
conclusion that <strong>APFS obtains a global kernel lock during read-only
operations such as <code>readdir()</code></strong>. In other words, APFS slows down when
attempting to perform parallel read-only I/O.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time I've encountered such behavior in a
filesystem: last year I
<a href="/blog/2017/12/08/good-riddance-to-aufs/">blogged about very similar behavior in AUFS</a>,
which was making Firefox CI significantly slower.</p>
<p>Because Python 2.7's module importing mechanism was triggering the
slowness by calling <code>readdir()</code>, I
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-October/155466.html">posted to python-dev</a>
about the problem, as I thought it was important to notify the larger
Python community. After all, this is a generic problem that affects
the performance of starting <em>any</em> Python process when running on APFS.
i.e. if your build system invokes many Python processes in parallel,
you could be impacted by this. As part of obtaining data for that post, I
discovered that Python 3.7 does not call <code>readdir()</code> as part of
module importing and therefore doesn't exhibit a severe slowdown. (Python's
module importing code was rewritten significantly in Python 3 and the <em>fix</em>
was likely introduced well before Python 3.7.)</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://gist.github.com/indygreg/a50e187f5372807cdcab5ac12bc2feea">produced a gist that can reproduce the problem</a>.
The script essentially performs a recursive directory walk. It exercises
the <code>opendir()</code>, <code>readdir()</code>, <code>closedir()</code>, and <code>lstat()</code> functions
heavily and is essentially a benchmark of the filesystem and filesystem
cache's ability to return file metadata.</p>
<p>When you tell it to walk a very large directory tree - say a Firefox
version control checkout (which has over 250,000 files) - the excessive
time spent in the kernel is very apparent on macOS 10.13 High Sierra:</p>
<pre><code>$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 12 ~/src/firefox
ran 12 walks across 12 processes in 172.209s

real    2m52.470s
user    1m54.053s
sys    23m42.808s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 12 -j 1 ~/src/firefox
ran 12 walks across 1 processes in 523.440s

real    8m43.740s
user    1m13.397s
sys     3m50.687s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 18 -j 18 ~/src/firefox
ran 18 walks across 18 processes in 210.487s

real    3m30.731s
user    2m40.216s
sys    33m34.406s
</code></pre>
<p>On the same machine upgraded to macOS 10.14 Mojave, we see a bit of a
speedup!:</p>
<pre><code>$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 12 ~/src/firefox
ran 12 walks across 12 processes in 97.833s

real    1m37.981s
user    1m40.272s
sys    10m49.091s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 12 -j 1 ~/src/firefox
ran 12 walks across 1 processes in 461.415s

real    7m41.657s
user    1m05.830s
sys     3m47.041s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 18 -j 18 ~/src/firefox
ran 18 walks across 18 processes in 140.474s

real    2m20.727s
user    3m01.048s
sys    17m56.228s
</code></pre>
<p>Contrast with my i7-6700K Linux machine backed by EXT4:</p>
<pre><code>$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 8 ~/src/firefox
ran 8 walks across 8 processes in 6.018s

real    0m6.191s
user    0m29.670s
sys     0m17.838s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 8 -j 1 ~/src/firefox
ran 8 walks across 1 processes in 33.958s

real    0m34.164s
user    0m17.136s
sys     0m13.369s

$ time ./slow-readdir.py -l 12 -j 12 ~/src/firefox
ran 12 walks across 12 processes in 25.465s

real    0m25.640s
user    1m4.801s
sys     1m20.488s
</code></pre>
<p>It is apparent that macOS 10.14 Mojave has received performance work
relative to macOS 10.13! Overall kernel CPU time when performing parallel
directory walks has decreased substantially - to ~50% of original on some
invocations! Stacks seem to reveal new code for lock acquisition, so this
might indicate generic improvements to the kernel's locking mechanism
rather than APFS specific changes. Changes to file metadata caching could
also be responsible for performance changes. Although it is difficult to tell
without access to the APFS source code. Despite those improvements, APFS
is still spending a lot of CPU time in the kernel. And the kernel CPU time
is still comparatively very high compared to Linux/EXT4, even for single
process operation.</p>
<p>At this time, I haven't conducted a comprehensive analysis of APFS to
determine what other filesystem operations seem to acquire global kernel
locks: all I know is <code>readdir()</code> does. A casual analysis of profiled
stacks when running Mercurial's test harness against Python 3.7 seems
to show <code>apfs_*</code> functions still on the stack a lot and that seemingly
indicates more APFS slowness under parallel I/O load. But HFS+ exhibited
similar problems (it appeared HFS+ used a single I/O thread inside the
kernel for many operations, making I/O on macOS pretty bad), so I'm
not sure if these could be considered <em>regressions</em> the way <code>readdir()</code>'s
new behavior is.</p>
<p>I've reported this issue to Apple at
<a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/web/?problemID=45648013">https://bugreport.apple.com/web/?problemID=45648013</a>
and on OpenRadar at <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5025294012383232">https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5025294012383232</a>.
I'm told that issues get more attention from Apple when there are many
duplicates of the same issue. So please reference this issue if you file your
own report.</p>
<p>Now that I've elaborated on the technical details, I'd like to add some
personal commentary. While this post is about APFS, this issue of global
kernel locks during common I/O operations is not unique to APFS. I
<a href="/blog/2017/12/08/good-riddance-to-aufs/">already referenced</a> similar
issues in AUFS. And I've encountered similar behaviors with Btrfs (although
I can't recall exactly which operations). And NTFS has its own
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/873#issuecomment-425272829">bag of problems</a>.</p>
<p>This seeming pattern of global kernel locks for common filesystem operations
and slow filesystems is really rubbing me the wrong way. Modern NVMe SSDs
are capable of reading and writing well over 2 gigabytes per second and
performing hundreds of thousands of I/O operations per second. We even have
Intel soon producing
<a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/re-architecting-data-center-memory-storage-hierarchy/">persistent solid state storage that plugs into DIMM slots</a>
because it is that friggin fast.</p>
<p>Today's storage hardware is capable of ludicrous performance. It is fast enough
that you will likely saturate multiple CPU cores processing the read or written
data coming from and going to storage - especially if you are using higher-level,
non-JITed (read: slower) programming languages (like Python). There has also been
a trend that systems are growing more CPU cores faster than they are instructions
per second per core. And SSDs only achieve these ridiculous IOPS numbers if many
I/O operations are <em>queued</em> and can be more efficiently dispatched within the
storage device. What this all means is that it probably makes sense to use
parallel I/O across multiple threads in order to extract all potential
performance from your persistent storage layer.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that we now have solid state storage that outperforms (in
some dimensions) what DRAM from ~20 years ago was capable of. Put another way I/O
APIs and even some filesystems were designed in an era when its RAM was slower than
what today's persistent storage is capable of! While I'm no filesystems or kernel
expert, it does seem a bit silly to be using APIs and filesystems designed for an
era when storage was multiple orders of magnitude slower and systems only had a
single CPU core.</p>
<p>My takeaway is I can't help but feel that systems-level software (including the
kernel) is severely limiting the performance potential of modern storage
devices. If we have e.g. global kernel locks when performing common I/O operations,
there's no chance we'll come close to harnessing the full potential of today's
storage hardware. Furthermore, the behavior of filesystems is woefully under
documented and software developers have little solid advice for how to achieve
optimal I/O performance. As someone who cares about performance, I want to
squeeze every iota of potential out of hardware. But the lack of documentation
telling me which operations acquire locks, which strategies are best for say
reading or writing 10,000 files using N threads, etc makes this extremely
difficult. And even if this documentation existed, because of differences in
behavior across filesystems and operating systems and the difficulty in
programmatically determining the characteristics of filesystems at run time,
it is practically impossible to design a <em>one size fits all</em> approach to
high performance I/O.</p>
<p>The filesystem is a powerful concept. I want to agree and use the <em>everything is a
file</em> philosophy. Unfortunately, filesystems don't appear to be scaling very well
to support the potential of modern day storage technology. We're probably at the
point where commodity priced solid state storage is far more capable than today's
software for the majority of applications. Storage hardware manufacturers will
keep producing faster and faster storage and their marketing teams will keep
convincing us that we need to buy it. But until software catches up, chances are
most of us won't come close to realizing the true potential of modern storage
hardware. And that's even true for specialized applications that do employ tricks
taking hundreds or thousands of person hours to implement in order to eek out every
iota of performance potential. The average software developer and application
using filesystems as they were designed to be used has little to no chance of
coming close to utilizing the performance potential of modern storage devices.
That's really a shame. </p>
