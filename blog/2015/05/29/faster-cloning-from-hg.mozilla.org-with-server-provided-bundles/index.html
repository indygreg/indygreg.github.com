  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>When you type <em>hg clone</em>, the Mercurial server will create a <em>bundle</em>
from repository content at the time of the request and stream it to
the client. (Git works essentially the same way.)</p>
<p>This approach usually <em>just works</em>. But there are some downsides,
particularly with large repositories.</p>
<p>Creating bundles for large repositories is not cheap. For
mozilla-central, Firefox's main repository, it takes ~280s of CPU time
on my 2014 MacBook Pro to generate a bundle. Every time a client runs a
<em>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</em>, a server somewhere
is spinning a CPU core generating ~1.1 GB of data. What's more, if
another clone arrives at the same time, another process will perform
the exact same work! When we talk about multiple minutes of CPU time
per request, this extra work starts to add up.</p>
<p>Another problem with large repositories is interrupted downloads. If
you suffer a connectivity blip during your <em>clone</em> command, you'll
have to start from scratch. This potentially means re-transferring
hundreds of megabytes from the server. It also means the server has
to generate a new bundle, consuming even more CPU time. This is not
good for the user or the server.</p>
<p>There have been multiple outages of hg.mozilla.org as a result of
the service being flooded with clone requests to large repositories.
Dozens of clients (most of them in Firefox or Firefox OS
release automation) have cloned the same repository around the same
time and overwhelmed network bandwidth in the data center or CPU
cores on the Mercurial servers.</p>
<p>A common solution to this problem is to not use the <em>clone</em> command
to receive initial repository data from the server. Instead, a
static <em>bundle</em> file will be generated and made available to clients.
Clients will call <em>hg init</em> to create an empty repository then will
perform an <em>hg unbundle</em> to apply the contents of a pre-generated
bundle file. They will then run <em>hg pull</em> to fetch new data that
was created after the bundle was generated. (It's worth noting that
Git's <em>clone --reference</em> option is similar.)</p>
<p>This is a good technical solution. Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation have effectively implemented this. However, it is a lot of
work: you have to build your own bundle generation and hosting
infrastructure and you have to remember that every <em>hg clone</em> should
probably be using bundles instead. It is extra complexity and complexity
that must be undertaken by every client. If a client forgets, the
consequences can be disastrous (clone flooding leading to service
outage). Client-side opt-in is prone to lapses and doesn't scale.</p>
<p><strong>As of today, we've deployed a more scalable, server-based solution to
hg.mozilla.org.</strong></p>
<p>hg.mozilla.org is now itself generating bundles for a handful of
repositories, including mozilla-central, inbound, fx-team, and
mozharness. These bundles are being uploaded to Amazon S3. And
<strong>those bundles are being advertised by the server over Mercurial's
wire protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>When you install the <em>bundleclone</em> Mercurial extension, <em>hg clone</em> is
taught to look for bundles being advertised on the server. If a bundle
is available, the bundle is downloaded, applied, and then the client
does the equivalent of an <em>hg pull</em> to fetch all new data since when the
bundle was generated. If a bundle exists, it is used transparently: no
client side cooperation is needed beyond installing the <em>bundleclone</em>
extension. If a bundle doesn't exist, it simply falls back to
Mercurial's default behavior. <strong>This effectively shifts responsibility
for doing efficient clones from clients to server operators, which
means server operators don't need cooperation from clients to enact
important service changes.</strong> Before, if clients weren't using bundles,
we'd have to wait for clients to update their code. Now, we can see
a repository is being cloned heavily and start generating bundles for
it without having to wait for the client to deploy new code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we've built primitive <em>content negotiation</em> into the
process. The server doesn't simply advertise one bundle file: it
advertises several bundle files. We offer gzip, bzip2, and <em>stream</em>
bundles. gzip is what Mercurial uses by default. It works OK. bzip2
bundles are smaller, but they take longer to process. <em>stream</em> bundles
are essentially tar archives of the <em>.hg/store</em> directory and are larger
than gzip bundles, but insanely fast because there is very little CPU
required to apply them. In addition, we advertise URLs for multiple S3
regions, currently us-west-2 (Oregon) and us-east-1 (Virginia). This
enables clients to prefer the bundle most appropriate for them.</p>
<p>A benefit of serving bundles from S3 is that Firefox and Firefox OS
release automation (the biggest consumers of hg.mozilla.org) live in
Amazon EC2. They are able to fetch from S3 over a gigabit network.
And, since we're transferring data within the same AWS region, there
are no data transfer costs. Previously, we were transferring ~1.1 GB
from a Mozilla data center to EC2 for each clone. This took up bandwidth
in Mozilla's network and cost Mozilla money to send data thousands of
miles away. And, we never came close to saturating a gigabit network (we
do with stream bundles). Wins everywhere!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/bundleclone.html">full instructions</a>
detail how to use <em>bundleclone</em>. <strong>I recommend everyone at Mozilla
install the extension</strong> because there should be no downside to doing it.</p>
<p>Once <em>bundleclone</em> is deployed to Firefox and Firefox OS release
automation, we should hopefully never again see those machines bring
down hg.mozilla.org due to a flood of clone requests. We should also
see a drastic reduction in load to hg.mozilla.org. I'm optimistic
bandwidth will decrease by over 50%!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the functionality from the <em>bundleclone</em> extension
is coming to vanilla Mercurial. The functionality (which was initially
added by Mozilla's Mike Hommey) is part of Mercurial's <em>bundle2</em> protocol,
which is available, but isn't enabled by default yet. <em>bundleclone</em> is thus
a temporary solution to bring us server stability and client
improvements until modern Mercurial versions are deployed everywhere
in a few months time.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to credit Augie Fackler for the
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.devel/54872/focus=54872">original idea</a>
for server-assisted bundle-based clones.</p>
