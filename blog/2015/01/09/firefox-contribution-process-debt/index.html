  <p>As I was
<a href="/blog/2014/12/30/firefox-source-documentation-versus-mdn/">playing around with source-derived documentation</a>,
I grasped the reality that any attempt to move documentation out of
MDN's wiki and into something derived from source code (despite the
argued technical and quality advantages) would likely be met with fierce
opposition because the change process for Firefox is much more involved
than <em>edit a wiki</em>.</p>
<p>This observation casts light on something important: <strong>the very act of
contributing <em>any</em> change to Firefox is too damn hard.</strong></p>
<p>I've always believed this statement to be true. I even like to think I'm
one of the few people that has consistently tried to do something about
it (inventing mach, overhauling the build system, bootstrap scripting,
MozReview, etc). But I, like many of the seasoned Firefox developers,
often lose sight of this grim reality. (I think it's fair to say that
new contributors often complain about the development experience and
as we grow accustomed to it, the complaint volume and intensity wanes).</p>
<p><strong>But when you have the simplicity of editing a wiki page on MDN juxtaposed
against the Firefox change contribution process of today, the inefficiency
of the Firefox process is clearly seen.</strong></p>
<p>The amount of knowledge required to change Firefox is obscenely absurd. Sure,
some complex components will always be difficult to change. But I'm talking
about <em>any</em> component: the base set of knowledge required to contribute
<em>any</em> change to Firefox is vast. This is <strong>before</strong> we get into any
domain-specific knowledge inside Firefox. <strong>I have always believed and
will continue to believe that this is a grave institutional issue for
Mozilla.</strong> It should go without saying that I believe this is an issue worth
addressing. After all, <strong>any piece of knowledge required for
contribution is essentially an obstacle to completion. Elimination of
required knowledge lowers the barrier to contribution.</strong> This, in turn,
allows increased contribution via more and faster change. This advances
the quality and relevance of Firefox, which enables Mozilla to advance
its <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">Mission</a>.</p>
<p>Seasoned contributors have probably internalized most of the knowledge
required to contribute to Firefox. Here is a <strong>partial</strong> list to remind
everyone of the sheer scope of it:</p>

</ul>

<p>Holy #$%@, that's a lot of knowledge. Not only is this list incomplete,
it's also not encompassing a lot of the domain-specific knowledge around
the content being changed.</p>
<p>Every item on this list represents a point where a potential contributor
could throw up their arms out of despair and walk away, giving their
time and talents to another project. Every item on this list that takes
10 minutes instead of 5 could be the tipping point. For common actions,
things that take 5 seconds instead of 1 could be the difference maker.
<strong>This list thus represents reasons that people do not contribute to
Firefox or contribute ineffectively (in the case of common contributors,
like paid Mozilla staff).</strong></p>
<p>I view items on this list as <strong>process debt</strong>. <em>Process debt</em> is a term
I'm coining (perhaps someone has beat me to it - I'm writing this on a
plane without Internet access) that is a sibling of <em>technical debt</em>.
<em>Process debt</em> is overhead and inefficiency associated with <em>processes</em>.
The border between <em>process debt</em> and <em>technical debt</em> in computers is
the code itself (although that border may sometimes not be very
well-defined, as code and process are oftentimes similar, such as most
interactions with version control or code review tools).</p>
<p>When I see this list of <em>process debt</em>, I'm inspired by the opportunity
to streamline the processes and bask in the efficiency gains. But I am
also simultaneously overwhelmed by the vast scope of things that need
improved. When I think about the amount of energy that will need to be
exerted to fight the <em>OMG change</em> crowd, the list becomes <em>depressing</em>.
But discussing institutional resistance to change, the <em>stop energy</em>
associated with it, and Mozilla's historical record of failing to invest
in fixing process (and technical) debt is for another post.</p>
<p>When looking at the above list, I can think of the following general
ways to make it more approachable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove an item completely. If it isn't on the list, there is nothing
   to know and no overhead. The best way to solve a problem is to make
   it not exist.</li>
<li>Automate an item and makes its existence largely transparent. If an
   item is invisible, does it exist in the mind of a contributor? (This
   is also known as solving the problem by adding a layer of
   indirection.)</li>
<li>Change an item so that it is identical to another, more familiar
   process. If you use a well-defined process, there is no new knowledge
   that must be learned and the cost of on-boarding someone already
   familiar with that knowledge is practically zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you start staring at this list of Firefox contribution process debt,
you start thinking about priorities, groupings, and strategies. You look
around at what others are doing to see if you can borrow good ideas.</p>
<p>I've done a lot of thinking on the subject and have some ideas and
recommendations. Stay tuned for some additional posts on the topic.</p>
