  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>The ascendancy of GitHub has very little to do with its namesake tool,
Git.</p>
<p>What GitHub did that was so radical for its time and the strategy that
GitHub continues to execute so well on today is the approach of
putting <em>code first</em> and enabling change to be a frictionless process.</p>
<p>In case you weren't around for the pre-GitHub days or don't remember,
they were not pleasant. Tools around code management were a far cry
from where they are today (I still argue the tools are pretty bad, but
that's for another post). Centralized version control systems were
prevalent (CVS and Subversion in open source, Perforce, ClearCase,
Team Foundation Server, and others in the corporate world). Tools for
looking at and querying code had horrible, ugly interfaces and came out
of a previous era of web design and browser capabilities. It felt like
a chore to do anything, including committing code. Yes, the world
had awesome services like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>,
but they weren't the same as GitHub is today.</p>
<p>Before I get to my central thesis, I want to highlight some supporting
reasons for GitHub's success. There were two developments in the second
half of the 2000s the contributed to the success of GitHub: the rises
of the distributed version control system (DVCS) and the modern web.</p>
<p>While distributed version control systems like Sun WorkShop TeamWare and
BitKeeper existed earlier, it wasn't until the second half of the 2000s
that DVCS systems took off. You can argue part of the reason for this
was open source: my recollection is there wasn't a well-known DVCS
available as free software before 2005. Speaking of 2005, it was a big
year for DVCS projects: Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar all had initial
releases. Suddenly, there were old-but-new ideas on how to do source
control being exposed to new and willing-to-experiment audiences. DVCS
were a critical leap from traditional version control because they
(theoretically) impose less process and workflow limitations on users.
With traditional version control, you needed to be online to commit,
meaning you were managing patches, not commits, in your local
development workflow. There were some forms of branching and merging,
but they were a far cry from what is available today and were often too
complex for mere mortals to use. As more and more people were exposed to
<em>distributed</em> version control, they welcomed its less-restrictive and
more powerful workflows. They realized that source control tools don't
have to be so limiting. <em>Distributed</em> version control also promised all
kinds of revamped workflows that could be harnessed. There were
potential wins all around.</p>
<p>Around the same time that open source DVCS systems were emerging, web
browsers were evolving from an application to render static pages to a
platform for running web <em>applications</em>. Web sites using JavaScript
to dynamically manipulate web page content (DHTML as it was known back
then) were starting to hit their stride. I believe it was GMail that
turned the most heads as to the full power of the <em>modern web</em>
experience, with its novel-for-its-time extreme reliance on
XMLHttpRequest for dynamically changing page content. People were
realizing that powerful, desktop-like applications could be built for
the web and could run everywhere.</p>
<p>GitHub launched in April 2008 standing on the shoulders of both the
emerging interest in the Git content tracking tool and the capabilities
of modern browsers.</p>
<p>I wasn't an early user of GitHub. My recollection is that GitHub was
mostly a Rubyist's playground back then. I wasn't a Ruby programmer, so
I had little reason to use GitHub in the early stages. But people did
start using GitHub. And in the spirit of Ruby (on Rails), GitHub moved
fast, or at least was projecting the notion that they were. While other
services built on top of DVCS tools - like Bitbucket - did exist back then,
GitHub seemed to have momentum associated with it. (Look at the archives
for <a href="https://github.com/blog">GitHub's</a> and
<a href="https://blog.bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket's</a> respective blogs. GitHub has
hundreds of blog entries; Bitbucket numbers in the dozens.) Developers
everywhere up until this point had all been dealing with sub-optimal tools
and workflows. Some of us realized it. Others hadn't. Many of those who
did saw GitHub as a beacon of hope: we have all these new ideas and new
potentials with distributed version control and here is a service under
active development trying to figure out how to exploit that. Oh, and
it's free for open source. Sign me up!</p>
<p>GitHub did capitalize on a market opportunity. They also capitalized on
the value of marketing and the perception that they were moving fast and
providing features that people - especially in open source - wanted.
This captured the early adopters market. But I think what really set
GitHub apart and led to the success they are enjoying today is their
<em>code first</em> approach and their desire to make contribution easy, and
even fun and sociable.</p>
<p>As developers, our job is to solve problems. We often do that by writing
and changing code. And this often involves working as part of a team, or
collaborating. To collaborate, we need tools. You eventually need some
processes. And as I
<a href="/blog/2015/01/09/firefox-contribution-process-debt/">recently blogged</a>,
this can lead to <em>process debt</em> and inefficiencies associated with them.</p>
<p>Before GitHub, the <em>process debt</em> for contributing to other projects was
high. You often had to subscribe to mailing lists in order to submit
patches as emails. Or, you had to create an account on someone's bug
tracker or code review tool before you could send patches. Then you had
to figure out how to use these tools and any organization or
project-specific extensions and workflows attached to them. It was quite
involved and a lot could go wrong. Many projects and organizations (like
Mozilla) still practice this traditional methology. Furthermore (and as
I've
<a href="/blog/2014/10/27/implications-of-using-bugzilla-for-firefox-patch-development/">written before</a>),
these traditional, single patch/commit-based tools often aren't
effective at ensuring the desired output of high quality software.</p>
<p>Before GitHub solved <em>process debt</em> via commoditization of knowledge via
market dominance, they took another approach: emphasizing <em>code first</em>
development.</p>
<p>GitHub is all about the <strong>code</strong>. You load a project page and you see
<strong>code</strong>. You may think a README with basic project information would be
the first thing on a <em>project</em> page. But it isn't. <em>Code</em>, like data,
is king.</p>
<p>Collaboration and contribution on GitHub revolve around the <em>pull
request</em>. It's a way of saying, <em>hey, I made a change, will you take
it?</em> There's nothing too novel in the concept of the <em>pull request</em>:
it's fundamentally no different than sending emails with patches to a
mailing list. But what is so special is GitHub's execution. Gone are
the days of configuring and using one-off tools and processes. Instead,
we have the friendly confines of a clean, friendly, and modern web
experience. While GitHub is built upon the Git tool, you don't even
need to use Git (a tool
<a href="http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">lampooned</a>
for its
<a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/">horrible usability and approachability</a>)
to contribute on GitHub! Instead, you can
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/">do everything from your browser</a>.
That warrants repeating: <strong>you don't need to leave your browser to
contribute on GitHub</strong>. GitHub has essentially reduced <em>process debt</em>
to <em>edit a text document</em> territory, and pretty much anybody who has
used a computer can do that. This has enabled GitHub to dabble into
non-code territory, such as its
<a href="https://government.github.com/">GitHub and Government</a> initiative to
foster community involvement in government. (GitHub is really a platform
for easily seeing and changing <em>any</em> content or data. But, please, let
me continue using <em>code</em> as a stand-in, since I want to focus on the
developer audience.)</p>
<p>GitHub took an overly-complicated and fragmented world of varying
contribution processes and made the new world revolve around code and a
unified and simple process for change - the <em>pull request</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, there are other reasons for GitHub's success. You can make strong
arguments that GitHub has capitalized on the social and psychological
aspects of coding and human desire for success and happiness. I agree.</p>
<p>You can also argue GitHub succeeded because of Git. That statement is
more or less technically accurate, but I don't think it is a sound
argument. Git may have been the most feature complete open source
DVCS at the time GitHub came into existence. But that doesn't mean there
is something special about Git that no other DVCS has that makes GitHub
popular. Had another tool been more feature complete or had the backing
of a project as large as Linux at the time of GitHub's launch, we could
very well be looking at a successful service built on something that
isn't Git. Git had early market advantage and I argue its popularity
today - a lot of it via GitHub - is largely a result of its early
advantages over competing tools. And, I would go so far to say that when
you consider the poor usability of Git and the pain that its users go
through when first learning it, more accurate statements would be that
<em>GitHub succeeded in spite of Git</em> and <em>Git owes much of its success to
GitHub</em>.</p>
<p>When I look back at the rise of GitHub, I see a service that has
succeeded by putting people first by allowing them to capitalize
on more productive workflows and processes. They've done this by
emphasizing <em>code</em>, not process, as the means for change. Organizations
and projects should take note.</p>
