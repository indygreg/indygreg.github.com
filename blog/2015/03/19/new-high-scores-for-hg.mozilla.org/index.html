  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>It's been a <a href="/blog/2015/03/18/network-events/">rough week</a>.</p>
<p>The very short summary of events this week is that both the Firefox
and Firefox OS release automation has been performing a denial of
service attack against
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is nothing new. The release automation
is by far the top consumer of hg.mozilla.org data, requesting several
terabytes per day via several million HTTP requests from thousands of
machines in multiple data centers. The very nature of their existence
makes them a significant denial of service threat.</p>
<p>Lots of things went wrong this week. While a post mortem will shed
light on them, many fall under the umbrella of <em>release automation was
making more requests than it should have and was doing so in a way
that both increased the chances of an outage occurring and increased
the chances of a prolonged outage.</em> This resulted in the hg.mozilla.org
servers working harder than they ever have. As a result, we have some
new <em>high scores</em> to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On UTC day March 19, hg.mozilla.org transferred 7.4 TB of data.
  This is a significant increase from the ~4 TB we expect on a typical
  weekday. (Even more significant when you consider that most load is
  generated during peak hours.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 1300 UTC hour of March 17, the cluster received 1,363,628
  HTTP requests. No HTTP 503 Service Not Available errors were
  encountered in that window! 300,000 to 400,000 requests per hour is
  typical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 0800 UTC hour of March 19, the cluster transferred 776 GB
  of repository data. That comes out to at least 1.725 Gbps on average
  (I didn't calculate TCP and other overhead). Anything greater than 250
  GB per hour is not very common. No HTTP 503 errors were served from
  the origin servers during this hour!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We encountered many periods where hg.mozilla.org was operating more than
twice its normal and expected operating capacity and it was able to
handle the load just fine. As a server operator, I'm proud of this.
The servers were provisioned beyond what is normally needed of them and
it took a truly exceptional event (or two) to bring the service down.
This is generally a good way to do hosted services (you rarely want to be
barely provisioned because you fall over at the slighest change and you
don't want to be grossly over-provisioned because you are wasting money
on idle resources).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hg.mozilla.org service did fall over. Multiple times,
in fact. There is room to improve. As proud as I am that the service
operated well beyond its expected limits, I can't help but feel ashamed
that it did eventual cave in under even extreme load and that people are
probably making under-informed general assumptions like <em>Mercurial can't
scale</em>. The simple fact of the matter is that clients cumulatively
generated an exceptional amount of traffic to hg.mozilla.org this week.
All servers have capacity limits. And this week we encountered the limit
for the current configuration of hg.mozilla.org. Cause and effect.</p>
