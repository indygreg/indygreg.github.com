  <p>Mercurial 3.5 was released today. I contributed some small
improvements to this version that I thought I'd share with the world.</p>
<p>The feature I'm most proud of adding to Mercurial 3.5 is what I'm
referring to as <em>auto share</em>. The existing <em>hg share</em> extension/command
enables multiple checkouts of a repository to share the same backing
repository store. Essentially the <em>.hg/store</em> directory is a symlink
to shared directory. This feature has existed in Mercurial for years
and is essentially identical to the <em>git worktree</em> feature just
recently added in Git 2.5.</p>
<p>My addition to the <em>share</em> extension is the ability for Mercurial to
automatically perform an <em>hg clone</em> + <em>hg share</em> in the same operation.
If the <em>share.pool</em> config option is defined, <em>hg clone</em>
will automatically clone or pull the repository data somewhere inside
the directory pointed to by <em>share.pool</em> then create a new working copy
from that shared location. But here's the magic: <strong>Mercurial can
automatically deduce that different remotes are the same logical
repository (by looking at the root changeset) and automatically have
them share storage</strong>. So if you first <em>hg clone</em> the <em>canonical</em>
repository then later do a <em>hg clone</em> of a <em>fork</em>, Mercurial will
pull down the changesets unique to the fork into the previously
created shared directory and perform a checkout from that. Contrast
with performing a full clone of the fork. <strong>If you are cloning multiple
repositories that are logically derived from the same original one,
this can result in a significant reduction of disk space and network
usage.</strong> I wrote this feature with automated consumers in mind,
particularly continuous integration systems. However, there is also
mode more suitable for humans where repositories are pooled not by their
root changeset but by their URL. For more info, see <em>hg help -e share</em>.</p>
<p>For Mercurial 3.4, I contributed changes that refactored how Mercurial's
tags cache works. This cache was a source of performance problems at
Mozilla's scale for many years. Since upgrading to Mercurial 3.4,
Mozilla has not encountered any significant performance problems with
the cache on either client or server as far as I know.</p>
<p>Building on this work, Mercurial 3.5 supports transferring tags cache
entries from server to client when clients clone/pull. Before, clients
would have to recompute tags cache entries for pulled changesets. On
repositories that are very large in terms of number of files (over 50,000)
or heads (hudreds or more), this could take several dozen seconds or
even minutes. This would manifest as a delay either during or after
initial clone. In Mercurial 3.5 - assuming both client and server
support the new <em>bundle2</em> wire protocol - the cache entries are
transferred from server to client and no extra computation needs to
occur. The client does pay a very small price for transferring this
additional data over the wire, but the payout is almost always worth it.
<strong>For large repositories, this feature means clones are usable sooner.</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a coworker told me that connections to a Mercurial
server were timing out mid clone. We investigated and discovered a
potential for a long CPU-intensive pause during clones where Mercurial
would not touch the network. On this person's under-powered EC2
instance, the pause was so long that the server's inactivity timeout
was triggered and it dropped the client's TCP connection. I refactored
Mercurial's cloning code so there is no longer a pause. There should
be no overall change in clone time, but there is no longer a perceivable
delay between applying changesets and manifests where the network could
remain idle. This investigation also revealed some potential follow-up
work for Mercurial to be a bit smarter about how it interacts with
networks.</p>
<p>Finally, I contributed <em>hg help scripting</em> to Mercurial's help database.
This help topic covers how to use Mercurial from scripting and other
automated environments. It reflects knowledge I've learned from seeing
Mercurial used in automation at Mozilla.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of other changes in Mercurial 3.5. Stay
tuned for another blog post.</p>
