  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Mercurial 3.5 was released today (following Mercurial's time-based
schedule of releasing a new version every 3 months).</p>
<p>There were roughly 1000 commits between 3.4 and 3.5, making this a
busy version. Although, 1000 commits per release has become the new
norm, as development on Mercurial has accelerated in the past few
years.</p>
<p>In my mind, the major highlight of Mercurial 3.5 is that the new
<em>bundle2</em> wire protocol for transferring data during <em>hg push</em>
and <em>hg pull</em> is now enabled by default on the client. Previously,
it was enabled by default only on the server.
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">hg.mozilla.org</a> is running Mercurial 3.4,
so clients that upgrade to 3.5 today will be speaking to it using
the new wire protocol.</p>
<p>The <em>bundle2</em> wire protocol succeeds the existing protocol
(which has been in place for years) and corrects many of its
deficiencies. Before bundle2, pull and push operations were not
atomic because Mercurial was performing a separate API call for
each piece of data. It would start by transferring changeset data
and then have subsequent transfers of metadata like bookmarks
and phases. As you can imagine, there were race conditions and
scenarios where pushes could be incomplete (not atomic). bundle2
transfers all this data in one large chunk, so there are much
stronger guarantees for data consistency and for atomic operations.</p>
<p>Another benefit of bundle2 is it is a fully extensible data exchange
format. Peers can add additional <em>parts</em> to the payload. For
extensions that wish to transfer additional metadata (like
Mozilla's <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/pushlog.html">pushlog</a>
data), they can simply add this directly into the data
stream without requiring additional requests over the wire protocol.
This translates to fewer network round trips and faster push and pull
operations.</p>
<p>The <em>progress</em> extension has been merged into Mercurial's core and
is enabled by default. It is now safe to remove the
<em>extensions.progress</em> config option from your hgrc.</p>
<p>Mercurial 3.5 also (finally) drops support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
Hopefully nobody reading this is still running these ancient and
unsupported versions of Python. This is a win for Mercurial developers,
as we were constantly having to work around deficiencies with these old
Python releases. There were dozens of commits removing hacks and
workarounds for Python 2.4 and 2.5. Dropping 2.4 and 2.5 also
means Python 3 porting can begin in earnest. However, this isn't a high
priority for anyone, so don't hold your breath.</p>
<p>There were a number of performance improvements in 3.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>operations involving obsolescence markers are faster (for users of
  changeset evolution)</li>
<li>various revsets were optimized</li>
<li>parts of phases calculation are now performed in C. The <em>not public()</em>
  revset should be much faster.</li>
<li><em>hg status</em> and things walking the filesystem are faster (Mozillians
  should be using <em>hgwatchman</em> to make <em>hg status</em> insanely fast)</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>ui.allowemptycommit</em> config option was introduced to control whether
empty commits are allowed. Mozillians manually creating <em>trychooser</em>
commits may run into problems creating empty commits without this
option (a better solution is to use <em>mach push-to-try</em>).</p>
<p>Work is progressing on per-directory manifests. Currently, Mercurial
stores the mapping of files to content in a giant list called the
manifest. For repositories with tens or hundreds of thousands of
files, decoding and reading large manifests is very CPU intensive.
Work is being done to enable Mercurial to split manifests by directory.
So instead of a single manifest, there are several. This is a prequisite
to <em>narrow clone</em>, which is the ability to clone history for a subset
of files (like how Subversion works). This work will eventually enable
repositories with millions of files to exist without significant
performance loss. It will also allow
<a href="/blog/2014/09/09/on-monolithic-repositories/">monolithic repositories</a>
to exist without the common critique that they are too unwieldy to
use because they are so large.</p>
<p><em>hgignore</em> files now have an <em>include:</em> and <em>subinclude:</em> syntax that
can be used to include other files containing ignore rules. This
feature is useful for a number of reasons. First, it makes sense for
ignore rules to live in the directory hierarchy next to paths they
impact. Second, for people working with monolithic repositories, it
means you can <em>export</em> a sub-directory of your monorepo (to e.g. a
Git repository) and its ignore rules - being defined in local
directories - can still work. (I'm pretty sure Facebook is using this
approach to make its syncing of directories/projects from its Mercurial
monorepo to GitHub easier to manage.)</p>
<p>Significant work has been done on the template parser. If you have
written custom templates, you may find that Mercurial 3.5 is more
strict about parsing certain syntax.</p>
<p>Revsets with chained <em>or</em> no longer result in stack exhaustion. Before,
programmatically generated revsets like <em>1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6...</em>
would likely fail.</p>
<p>Interactions with servers over SSH should now display server output in
real time. Before, server output was buffered and only displayed at the
end of the operation. (You may not see this on hg.mozilla.org until
the server is upgraded to 3.5, which is planned for early September.)</p>
<p>There are now static analysis checks in place to ensure that Mercurial
config options have corresponding documentation in <em>hg help config</em>.
As a result, a lot of formerly undocumented options are now documented.</p>
<p>I contributed
<a href="/blog/2015/07/31/my-contributions-to-mercurial-3.5/">various improvements</a>.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>auto sharing repository data during clone</li>
<li>clone and pull performance improvements</li>
<li><em>hg help scripting</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There were tons of other changes, of course. See the
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_3.5_.282015-07-31.29">official release notes</a>
and the
<a href="https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UpgradeNotes#A3.5:_no_more_support_for_Python_2.4_or_2.5">upgrade notes</a>
for more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html">Mercurial for Mozillians Installing Mercurial</a>
article provides a Mozilla tailored yet generally applicable guide for
installing or upgrading Mercurial to 3.5. As always, conservative
software users may want to wait until September 1 for the 3.5.1 point
release to fix any issues or regressions from 3.5.</p>
