  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>Earlier this week, I landed some changes to the Firefox development
environment that aggressively make <em>mach</em> prompt to run <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em>. Full details in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1182677">bug 1182677</a>.</p>
<p>As expected, the change resulted in a fair amount of whining and
bemoaning among various Firefox developers. I wanted to take some time
to explain why we moved forward, even though we knew not everyone would
like the feature.</p>
<p>My official job title at Mozilla is <em>Developer Productivity Engineer</em>.
My job is to make you do your job better.</p>
<p>I've been an employee at Mozilla for four years and in that time I've
witnessed a surprising lack of understanding around version control
tools. (I don't think Mozilla is significantly different from most
other companies here.) I find that a significant number of people
are practicing sub-optimal version control workflows because they don't
know any better (common) or because they are unwilling to change from
learned habits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mercurial is a highly customizable tool. A lot of
Mozillians have spent a lot of time developing useful extensions to
Mercurial that enable Mozillians to use Mercurial more effectively and
to thus become more productive. The latest epic time-saving hack
is <a href="http://www.ncalexander.net/blog/2015/07/02/build-fennec-frontend-fast-with-mach-artifact/">Nick Alexander's work to make Fennec build 80% faster by
having deep integration with version control</a>.</p>
<p><em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is almost
<a href="/blog/2013/07/29/mercurial-setup-wizard-for-firefox-development/">two years old</a>.
Yet, when assisting my fellow Mozillians with Mercurial issues, my
"have you run mach mercurial-setup?" question is still often met with
blank stares followed by "wait, there's a mach mercurial-setup?!" What's
even more frustrating is people wrongly believing that Mercurial can't
do things like rebasing and then spreading misinformation about the
lackings of Mercurial. (Mercurial has many advanced features disabled
out of the box so new users don't footgun themselves.)</p>
<p>Just like Firefox would be irrelevant if it didn't have millions of users,
your awesome tool is mostly irrelevant if you are its only user. That's
why when I hear of someone say they created an amazing tool for
themselves or modified a third party tool without sending the improvements
upstream, my blood pressure rises a little. It rises because here this
person did something awesome and they or some limited subset of people
who happened to be following the person on Twitter or reading their blog
at that point in time managed to a) know about the tool b) take the
effort to install it. The uptake rate is insanely low and return on
investment for that tool is low. It results in duplication of effort.
I find this painfully frustrating because I want everyone to have easy
access to the best tools available. This requires that tools are well
advertised and easy to install and use.</p>
<p>The primary goal of <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is to make it super easy for
anyone to have an optimal Mercurial experience. It was apparent to me that
despite <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> existing, numerous people didn't know it
existed or weren't using it. Your awesome tool isn't very awesome unless
people are using it. And a lot of the awesome tools people have built
around Mercurial at Mozilla weren't being utilized and lots of
productivity wins were thus being unrealized. Forcefully pushing <em>mach
mercurial-setup</em> onto people is thus an attempt to unlock unrealized
productivity wins and to make people happier about the state of their
tools.</p>
<p>I'm not thrilled that mach's prompting to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> is
as disruptive as it is. It's bad user experience. I know better. But,
(and this is explained somewhat in the bug), other solutions are more
complicated and have other gotchas. The current, invasive implementation
was the easiest to implement and has the biggest bang for the buck in
terms of adoption. We knew people would complain about it. But from
my perspective, it was do this or do nothing. And nothing hadn't been
very effective. So we did something.</p>
<p>There has been lots of feedback about the change this week. Most
surprising to me is the general sentiment of "I don't want something
automatically changing my hgrc file." I find this surprising because
<em>mach mercurial-setup</em> puts the user firmly in control by prompting
before doing anything, thus respecting user choice and avoiding gotchas
and unwanted changes. It's clear this property needs to be advertised a
bit more so people aren't scared to run <em>mach mercurial-setup</em> and don't
spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the tool to others. (I also
find it somewhat surprising people would think this in the first place:
I'd like to think we'd implicitly trust most Mozillians to implement
tools that respect user choice and don't do <em>malicious</em> things.)</p>
<p>Like all software, things can and will change. The user experience of
this new feature isn't terrific. We'll iterate on it. If you want to
help enact change, please
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=mach">file a bug in Core :: mach</a>
(for now) and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and your understanding.</p>
